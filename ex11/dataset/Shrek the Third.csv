0,Shrek the Third,5,18 May 2007,"Disappointing . . . kept on waiting for it to ""really start""","I'm a huge fan of the first Shrek and the second one also exceeded my expectations. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. They also shared clever humor and for the most part unpredictable. I was extremely excited for the the third movie and I have to unfortunately say I was totally disappointed! The whole time I was waiting for it to start, like trying to convince myself, ""ok, any second now it will pick up"" - but it never did. The plot is so thin and unexciting - Prince Charming wants to takeover the throne while Shrek wants to get a young (King) Arthur to replace him as next in line to the throne. You never really feel any interest in what is happening or what will happen to the characters because you know exactly whats going to happen. Basically I spent the movie forcing myself to laugh because, hey, I was watching a Shrek movie. I know this review will not stop anyone who loved the previous movies from going to the third, but I just want to warn that its nothing to rush to or stand in line for."
1,Shrek the Third,5,20 May 2007,Too many characters to love--and that's a bad thing.  And the spark is gone.,"I have been bouncing around for weeks in anticipation of this movie. As a huge fan of the first two movies, I was sure this one would not disappoint. But, oh, how wrong I was! While not as bad as many a film out there, this installment is yet a sad shadow of its series.And it tries, it really did try. To its credit, there were several very clever scenes. The typical Snow White's gift with animals takes an awesome turn, and I can guarantee that you will never laugh harder at a death scene than the one of this movie. The animation? Top-notch.I just guess effort doesn't always beat out sheer inspiration. A film with a few moments does not win against a good, simple movie.The desire to produce a film merely ended up as a plot device to get Shrek and Fiona back to their beloved swamp. A long, boring plot device. With the passing of King Harold, Shrek and Fiona are heirs to the throne of Far, Far Away. Unfortunately, that does not interest them, so Shrek goes on a journey to bring back the next guy, a young Arthur ""Artie"" Pendragon. Heck, why not? Everyone loves a good Camelot infusion, and Artie is as flawed and as likable as you could want. Unfortunately, he is only one character in a cheesy madhouse of minor characters and cameos. In the effort to get everyone their screen time, that whole plot gets lost in the background.Which normally wouldn't be a problem. After all, the original movie did not have the most complex of plots. What it had was a few incredible characters. The second movie added a few more, but still kept it delightfully manageable. This time, it seemed that the powers that be assumed we already knew everything about Shrek, Donkey, Puss, and the rest of the bunch that we really didn't need to see them. Hey, let's bring in one more characters for the audience, but refuse to give them time to get to know them! Poor, pathetic lack of character development.So back to the plot. The few times that came around, it was pretty much a tacky, forced attempt to create some pseudo father/son relationship between Shrek and Artie. Good intentions, but no cigar. Maybe if we had more time... But we don't, so let's just wrap it up with a few corny lines about understanding and rising to the occasion. Yeah, we got that the first time around, and without any of the verbal commentary.On top of that, this film misses that inexplicable spark of the first two installments. I'm sorry, but I just didn't feel it. Just as a lukewarm attempt of continuing the series and aiming at a five-year old audience.Sorry. Not my favorite of the series by any means, leaving me to wonder how a sequel to films of such genius as ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" could make something so average?"
2,Shrek the Third,6,3 June 2007,"As clever, but not as funny as the first two","Shrek The Third is another entertaining romp through the erstwhile Hollywood of Far Far Away with a few laughs for adults and a few more for kids. Like all of the films in this series, it has a big and good heart, and occasionally pays homage to or pokes fun at modern films. Unlike the previous films, however, Shrek III is not a source of non-stop hilarity, and contains a little more thematic content.Shrek finds himself inheriting his father-in-law's crown and learns that Fiona is pregnant. Predictably, both of these eventualities play pretty dissonantly on the big green guy's insecurities, and he goes a-questing to locate the next-in-line of succession - a young, dejected, high school kid. Meanwhile, charming has developed even more of an attitude problem, and is putting together a whole battalion of people with grudges.One of the themes of the first two Shrek films was 'don't judge a book by its cover'. Shrek III takes the theme a little farther and puts a different spin on it. The lesson learned here is ""don't judge yourself superficially."" And it works. My rating of six is based solely on the entertainment value of the film. This film is not quite as well-paced and well-directed as the previous two films, and Charming is simply not the heavy-weight heavy that his mom was. Nevertheless, it's still worth a look, and still carries positive messages entertainingly."
3,Shrek the Third,3,29 May 2007,A Shrek Too far,"A movie too many, a laugh too few. This installment of Shrek is so unlike the first two in terms of energy and humor that its almost like one of those cheesy made-for-TV or straight-to-video versions that the studios make just to cash in on the popularity of a title.The movie slogs through a story about Shrek and Fiona having to replace the deceased frog king unless they can find another heir. Shrek's time at the ""high school"" is so tortured that you can almost smell the coffee the writers had to brew to get through the brainstorming sessions.Not good, I'm sorry to say. The first two were so clever that this ends up seeming...well...crappy by comparison.Part of success is knowing when to stop."
4,Shrek the Third,6,19 May 2007,Not Enough to be at level of first 2!,"The movie did not really hold the attention of my two younger kids. Even for me, the funny experience of watching both Shrek 1 and 2 was not really very evident with this installment. I remember in Shrek 2, I was laughing out loud with each passing pop culture reference and innuendo being bantered around. However, that was not so here.I was not too amused with the Disney princesses characters. Shrek's ""baby nightmare scene"" was well-executed. Justin Timberlake did well in voicing his ""grovelling at Merlin's feet"" scene. Overall, this movie was not that bad, but it needed to be much better to be worthy to stand on the same level as the first two Shrek films."
5,Shrek the Third,7,18 May 2007,"It was good, but it's lacking something","I couldn't wait to see Shrek the Third, especially since I have such a great love for the second Shrek, I'm just in love with Puss in Boots. But, the trailer looked great and the stories have worked so far, my mom and I saw the premier show today and while the movie has great laughs, there seemed to be something lacking in the Shrek world. I think the characters didn't seem to click as well as they did in the first two. Shrek the Third has the return of the whole cast, including the new heir to the thrown, Arthur.Shrek and Fiona have a problem, Fiona's father, the frog King of Far Far Away, has passed away and now it's up to Shrek to take the crown. But Shrek is too scared to step up and looks to the next man in line, well, actually a teenage, Arthur. Shrek, Puss, and Donkey go to find Artie, but there is one more problem going on, Prince Charming wants his kingdom of Far Far Away back like it was promised to him and he will go through anything to get it back. Fionna and the other princesses are kidnapped while Shrek's life is in danger and they must all pull together to save him in time for Arthur to take over the kingdom.Shrek the Third has great jokes, terrific animation, and lovable characters, especially the character, Merlin, he was just a terrific spoof. But the characters seemed to be lacking the same chemistry as they did in the first two films. I would recommend Shrek the Third, it's a good movie for the family and for a summer movie, because I do guarantee a fun time. I don't know if everyone will agree, but so far I know a few people know that there is something lacking from the world of Shrek.7/10"
6,Shrek the Third,5,16 May 2007,This ogre is starting to lose his charms,"The phenomenal success of the Shrek franchise - particularly ""Shrek 2"" - has prompted Dreamworks Animation to yet again squeeze out a story of an erstwhile happily ended tale and return to the screen once again with ""Shrek the Third"", which brings back most of the original cast, and then some, for another round of jabs at fairy tales and pop culture.The Kingdom of Far Far Away is faced with another dilemma: King Harold (John Cleese) has just died and next in line to the throne is Shrek (Mike Myers), who doesn't want to have anything to do with ruling a kingdom. So he goes to search for Artie (Justin Timberlake), Fiona's cousin and the third in line to the throne, in Worcestershire (no kidding), a medieval high school where all students seem to have jumped out of a Hollywood teen flick. Meanwhile, Fiona is pregnant with Shrek as a reluctant father; and Prince Charming teams up with villains from various fairy tales in an effort to take over the kingdom.While, yes, it's considerably better than ""Happily N'Ever After"", it's hard to define the movie as anything more than a disappointing mediocrity. It had the chance to be just as good as its predecessor, yet except for a few jokes, it doesn't generate consistent amusement or cleverness when it comes to delivering the laughs. Even with new characters that include Snow White (Amy Poehler), Cinderella (Amy Sedaris), Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri), and Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph) voiced by Saturday Night Live comedians, the film seems to have lost all sense of wit and humor that has made its first two predecessors a fun experience.As for the material itself, the narrative doesn't seem to have any real motivation or progression. It's merely stretching a premise into an hour-and-a-half end product that merely panders to the filmmakers' whims of extending a lucrative franchise that may be starting to run on fumes. It was easy to ride with these characters in the first film because the animated genre is incredibly trampled with clichés. But a joke can only be said so much before it starts to wear out. Here, directors Chris Miller and Raman Hui fail to give the characters any quality that would evoke sympathy, considering that the story falls flat and perfunctory.""Shrek the Third"" might still appeal to younger audiences, but that's about it as far as recommendations go. Save for sporadic chuckles, the audience I watched it with were quiet throughout the film. It feels hastily assembled and thrown together slapdash, without any attention to what made the first two work, and Dreamworks should get a clue that the ogre is starting to overstay his welcome."
7,Shrek the Third,1,11 September 2008,"Very bad use of music, amongst other thing-eths...This movie has jumped the Shrek and the Shark","I got tipsy off pumpkin martinis and thought this might be a good watch, it was on HBO's free viewing weekend last week. Now I can see why.The use of music in this film is downright disturbing. I wish they could just have a score for this film. The use of ""Live or Let Die"" didn't make any sense in a funeral, like another reviewer said. I was almost getting mad about it. It is about killing someone, not about mourning, any idiot would know that. The use of Immigrant Song is also a problem. It isn't funny the way it is used and it's the point of that song either, neither is the Heart song, Barracuda when the women are fighting. It's a love song, so it makes no sense as a fighting song, maybe Live or Let Die could have gone there instead. Then there's Rock and Roll High School in the high school scene, which is not very funny at all.I did like Pinocchio and Puss in Boots, but those are because their characters haven't been made overly hip by the writers. All the women characters were made into stereotypes, like Snow White, etc. I did think it was amusing when Sleeping Beauty kept falling asleep, yet in a way that didn't make sense because once she was awakened by her prince, she was up for good. Then the rest seemed to be fart and vomit jokes. Or jokes that fell flat. Or constant references to things that weren't funny. I guess the music was so us adults could reference them...wow, there's that lame ""I've never been to me"" song, awesome, I was just thinking about that the other day...oh wait, I wasn't!!! But I think they were trying to do that so the adults would get something out of it and it failed.Even for free, the movie is a waste of time and if I had kids, I wouldn't want them to watch this. It's really stupid and there are so many better kids' films out there that don't try to be hip and urban to the lack of plot line. There's more to life than pop culture, not to say this movie couldn't have done that a little if there was a plot, I hardly saw any plot...everything just seemed humorless and not having spirit. So the Shrek empire should probably end with this one...I mean, when everyone starts having kids...it's time to jump the Shrek right?"
8,Shrek the Third,1,28 April 2008,The third installment of the Shrek series.,"Of any sequel to any movie I have ever seen, Shrek the Third has to be the worst I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. When a movie is this bad I usually will stop watching it, but I thought that maybe it would go somewhere. Well, it did. Reference the movie title, Flushed Away. This is what anyone who was connected to this farce should have insisted on happening. The storyline is plausible. The King is dying and must name an heir. At first Shrek is asked to become the new King, but the little experience Shrek has had with being royal has not worked out. The scene where he and Fiona are all decked out in royal attire is painful. Not just to the characters, even though they were just drawn, in wearing such uncomfortable clothing, but to the viewer who must endure this torture as well. So off our hero and his side-kicks must go and get the next in line, a wallflower-type geek, Arthur. Oh yea, before they are out of earshot Shrek learns that he will soon be a dad. I have read that some people say that it's because of Justin Timberlake that this movie was ruined, but like everyone else, all he supplied was a voice. A monotonous, squeaky one, but a voice just the same. In fact, it seemed from what I could tell just by listening to everyone's voices, that no one seemed to be really into their characters at all. Jokes and scenes that worked well for the 1st 2 movies did not work for the 3rd movie, and in fact, besides being stale, no longer had any appeal. That there is a 4th, and possibly a 5th Shrek, is scary. Be afraid. Be very afraid."
9,Shrek the Third,5,20 May 2007,"Still worth seeing, but disappointing after the first 2","I had high expectations for this movie. When I saw Shrek 2, I was pleasantly surprised. Few sequels are as good as the original, but Shrek 2 was.Shrek the third did not continue this trend. While there were sill plenty of funny moments, it was nowhere near as amusing or original as the first two. They could have done so much more with this movie if they had tried. At the end, I felt sort of cheated.However, Shek the third isn't a bad movie in itself, only when compared to the others. I would still recommend going to see it. Unlike most, I liked Artie's character, even if he did talk too much (I'm not even a Justin Timberlake fan)."
10,Shrek the Third,6,25 May 2007,It's Just Decent,"When his new father-in-law, King Harold falls ill, Shrek is looked at as the heir to the land of Far Far Away. Not one to give up his beloved swamp, Shrek recruits his friends Donkey and Puss in Boots to install the rebellious Artie as the new king. Princess Fiona, however, rallies a band of royal girlfriends to fend off a coup d'etat by the jilted Prince Charming.I have to admit, I really wasn't as hyped to see this film than Shrek 2. The trailer was okay, the plot sounds less interesting, and many critics didn't like this film. Yeah, this film is full of energetic characters and some visually dazzling scenes, but it's not as funny, entertaining, or as great as the last two films.If you've seen the trailer, that's probably all the good jokes that they got in the film. I expected to laugh as much as I did at Shrek 2, since this film is more for the adults than the kids to enjoy. It's a sad fact that more of the jokes comes from secondary characters than the main ones. The action scenes were good, not great, but the story just doesn't interest me.And the Shrek and Fiona spark isn't as much there as it were in the previous two films. Now here's the good: I liked the secondary characters. They are all funny. This is the most visual Shrek film, having colorful scenes pop out.This film seems to rely more on the slapstick humor to cover up the weak plot, seemed to not be filled with originality. I didn't mind that. There are some pretty good jokes and some good action scenes. Don't watch this film expecting a great film like the first two, although I wanted this to be a worthy sequel."
11,Shrek the Third,1,9 June 2007,Skip it,"Shrek 3 trusts it's audience so little and has squandered so much good will in it's effort to milk cash from viewers, that it places it's characters on screen and nervously has them do stupid, ""funny"" things to reignite your interest and get the movie rolling. For fifteen minutes it barely considers plot, because maybe you don't like plot. So how about another pratfall?When a funeral is held and the song ""Live and Let Die"" is mined for unavailable laughs, you begin to understand just how bad this is going to be. The creators talked themselves into a dumb pop culture reference without any understanding of the damned song. The song is about revenge: The scene is about revenge about as much as Star Wars is about French Structuralism... so what the hell is it doing here? Hey guys, consider reading a book some time; then when you propose a joke you can know when what you have isn't funny. It's called ""having depth."" Instead of admiring a writer's cleverness, a viewer sits in the theater envisioning the limp team meeting where that idea was born, accompanied by desperate, wrong-headed titters from weak minds.Mike Myers should move on and find yet another movie to shoehorn his tiresome Scottish accent into.For the record the humans in this series have always creeped me out."
12,Shrek the Third,5,16 May 2007,Once vibrant series showing signs of middle age,"Halfway through the third installment of the popular CGI franchise, ""Shrek,"" one gets the distinct feeling that the end is near. What prompts these emotions? Oh, just the fact that the writers seem to have run out of ideas, funny jokes and interesting new characters.I suppose I'd feel different if I were an eight-year-old child, but ...As far as ideas go, the plot here has Harold, the frog king of Far Far Away (voice of John Cleese), dying (a hilarious segment that recalls Paul Reubens death scene in ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"") and trusting the kingdom to either Shrek (Mike Myers in his Scottish brogue) or the monarch's wimpy nephew, Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Meanwhile, in another bit of inspired comedy, defeated ""Prince"" Charming (Rupert Everett) is reduced to performing in a cheap dinner theater.This is basically where the originality ends, however. That does not mean the rest of the picture is bad - it is at least entertaining - but there's not much new any more. If ""Shrek The Third"" were a person, he'd be yelling at the neighbor kids to get off his lawn and eating supper at the IHOP at 3:30 p.m.Cases in point: Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) finds out she's pregnant and, like every expectant father in TV sit-com history, Shrek is frightened by his future parental obligations; Charming enlists all of the fairy tale villains in the land to join with him, invade Far Far Away and change the outcome of nursery rhymes (sounds like the plot of the turkey from earlier this year, ""Happily N'ever After""); and the captured women of Far Far Away, Fiona, Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews), Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White and Rapunzel (voiced by ""SNL"" cast members Cheri Oteri, Amy Sedaris, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph, respectively) become ninja warriors to try and save the day. Ho hum.Even the goofy antics of sidekicks Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas), as well as the vocal ""talents"" of Regis Philbin and Larry King (as the two ugly stepsisters), bring only smiles and smirks instead of side-splitting laughs like in the old days. In fact, the writers are forced to use the word ""poop"" several times to try and please an increasingly immature and vapid film-going audience.Only ""Monty Python"" alum Eric Idle (as an addled Merlin the Magician who switches Donkey and Puss' personalities) is even remotely funny and original among the new characters.After a battle featuring more windbag philosophy than daring-do, the rightful king is crowned and Fiona goes on to have a litter of baby ogres, who  like the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi""  look cute, but add nothing special to the production.Even the usually-clever closing credits (where the cast sings a classic song) was uninspired and listless this time around.As usual, the animation of this series is first-rate; unfortunately, the story does not match the technology and those who appreciate the combination will most likely be left feeling a bit empty inside."
13,Shrek the Third,4,20 May 2007,Shrek dreck,"It would be safe to say that the third time is definitely NOT the charm when it comes to the ""Shrek"" series, since ""Shrek the Third"" lacks virtually all the imaginativeness, wit and magic that made the previous two installments such tremendous fun for young and old viewers alike. In this latest go-round, the writers have clearly run out of comical inspiration, leaving us with a humorless farrago of labored jokes and sappy life-lessons (mainly about the joys of prospective fatherhood and the importance of being willing to take a chance in life) guaranteed to please no target audience or age group whatsoever.In this edition, Shrek's father-in-law, the frog king of the realm of Far Far Away, bequeaths his crown to Shrek on his deathbed unless the reluctant ogre can find a distant heir (the young Arthur) to take his place. Shrek, filled with doubts about his own ability to rule the kingdom, heads off with his faithful companions, Donkey and Puss In Boots, to find the boy and bring him back with them to the castle where he will assume his rightful place on the throne. Meanwhile, the vain, conniving Prince Charming has decided to enlist the aid of all the villains of the kingdom to mount a coup so that he can proclaim himself ruler of the land.As I reckon them, there are about five hearty laughs in ""Shrek the Third,"" and at least four of them come in the opening scene of the film (a very funny parody of third-rate dinner theater). Unfortunately, it's all pretty much downhill from there, as one ostensibly comic line after another crashes and burns, leaving us with little but the gorgeous backdrops and seamless animation to hold our attention. Regarding the latter point, it must be stated that movie animators have certainly come a long way in perfecting the facial expressions of their characters, but what is the point of such a technological advancement if it is placed in the service of as dismal a script as Andrew Adams, Howard Gould, Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, J. David Stern, David N. Weiss, and Jon Zack have concocted here? Somehow, you know you're in trouble when no fewer than seven writers have a hand in a screenplay, but couldn't at least one of them have come up with a funny joke or two while they were hammering it all out? Moreover, the story itself is dull and plodding and even the ""Shrek"" trademark of piling on clever pop culture references falls flat in this instance (and having Medieval teenagers blabbing away in already-dated Valley Girl lingo just doesn't cut it). Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas still provide yeoman service as the voices of Donkey and Puss In Boots, respectively, but even they can't keep the whole enterprise from feeling as if blockbuster rigor mortis has finally set in. Unlike the two earlier films in the series, ""Shrek the Third"" feels less the product of a magic spell than of a divine curse."
14,Shrek the Third,3,20 May 2007,Shoulda stopped at TWO,"Third installments are the hardest acts in the world. The second movie was commissioned on the popularity of the first. And if they green-light a third it must mean that the second was as equally or better than the first. So much expectation. So much to live up to.I felt sorry for Shrek the Third. It felt long. The cast seemed like strangers again. Not enough Fiona and Shrek. Not enough Puss in Boots and Donkey. Artie was hard to like. And ""Revenge"" stories are so single dimensional. When the 'villians/ bad guys' were attacking Far Far Away the movie felt dark.The biggest disappointment was the music. It sucked - big time! Honestly 'live and let die' at a funeral???? And what is it with singing frogs??? ""Flushed Away"" and ""Meet the Robinsons"" had singing frogs...Shrek had to add their own? Overall, my six year old enjoyed repeated watchings of it. I fell asleep. So thanks Dreamworks for finally alienating your paying audience and dumbing down the franchise to kids-only material. One vote off for that. Gone from 4/10 to 3/10."
15,Shrek the Third,1,19 June 2007,Unfunny,"Worst of the 3. Hang on, didn't I say that about Oceans 13 yesterday? It must be Groundhog Day then.Mike Myers brings back Shrek for a third run and there's no plot, no story and none of the great little one screen jokes we had with the previous 2 Shrek films.King Harold is dying (actaully he dies) and Shrek doesn't want to be King so he goes off to look for the next heir to the throne of Far Far Away.And Prince Charming takes over the kingdom while he's gone.The rest of the story is Shrek trying to persuade Arthur to be King, trying to face up to the idea he's going to be a father, Their journey back to Far Far Away and the rescue of Fiona and her friends which turns into the rescue of Shrek.Exceptionally weak plot, the film stumbles from scene to scene and shows no imagination at all.Extremely BORING and best avoided. This will go straight to DVD."
16,Shrek the Third,2,23 May 2007,Maybe they were forced by the government to preach to us,"I'm a Shrek fan, perhaps not the most enthusiastic in the world, but a fan nonetheless. I value the good laughs I got mainly from Shrek II, but I value them more because I could enjoy them with my entire family. That's rare for us. The Shrek series has plenty of magic to call upon: the entire panoply of mythic characters from Grimm through Disney, rendered in state-of-the-art realistic animation. It also has the resources of a star cast and the momentum of two previous successes. How then can it all add up to such a huge disappointment? It amazes me when Hollywood can take a success like 1 and 2, and make enough errors that coalesce into a cinematic mess. The writers took an excellent ensemble cast, good timing, a wicked sense of humor and addedwhat? Let's go through it. First they added ""meaning""as I leaned over and said to my twelve year old, ""it's like the film was high-jacked by a third grade teacher."" They added a new, major character (voiced by the genre-challenged Justin Timberlake) that was not only massively unappealing and unfunny, but an opportunity for my imaginary third grade teacher to ""teach"" us about bullying the little guy, etc. I could understand it if a studio was compelled (say by the equivalent of the federal miles per gallon standards forced onto domestic auto manufacturers) to have a certain amount of Department of Education approved ""teaching"" in a film, but that wouldn't explain their ambition to ""teach us"" about fears of parenthood. Who exactly do they like their audience is?The core issue is Shrek's reluctant to (a) have enough ambition to be king which is mysteriously offered to him over the true heiress, his wife, and (b) additional reluctance to shoulder the ambitions and responsibility of fatherhood. Funny? No. Third grade teacher material? Yes. Well, sort of, but maybe someone speaking to young adults (who will hate this preachy film). But comedy? No, not even close. So how does a studio take millions of dollars, a huge cast including comic talents like Mike Meyers, John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Eddie Murphy. OK, Eddie Murphy isn't that funny when he's in a fat suit, but he does good sidekick. My first inkling that something was wrong came early when the father-King frog died for a protracted scene. Remind me, what's funny about a guy dying for a long, long, time again? Then there's a whole scene at a medieval high school full of flat, dated ""valleyspeak"" that the kids have moved on from years ago. How old are these writers? Are they all obsessed with their first pregnancy? On top of all this they desecrate the already seriously overused Arthurian legend. This unfunny boy, Artie, is supposedly the young King Arthur. Adding insult, they make Merlin into a ineffectual retired hippie complete with Birkenstocks and a drumming circle. What are they trying to say? Isn't it enough to desecrate Disney's own products like making Captain Hook secret ambition to be a flower gardener? All here villains harbor lost ambitions and it takes a very minor confrontation to turn them back into productive citizens. It all goes on painfully long, unredeemed even by the credits, which were quite funny in Shrek II. It's hard to understand let alone explain a fiasco like this. Was the person in charge humor-impaired? Or perhaps they were not able to lead a huge machine like this, and ended up taking one or two bits from everyone, the whole never adding up. Was there an unfunny heavy boot from the studio? Did the studio want to make less money for some obscure stock-buy back scheme comprehensible only to the inner circle? We will never know. Maybe even the director, writers and cast can't explain it. It's like the fall of Rome. It happened; there are theories, but they are in the end just theories."
17,Shrek the Third,5,19 May 2007,The movie that rates itself: The Third.,"Paul McCartney is a great songwriter. Let me just get that out of the way. But he isn't perfect. Take for example the song, ""Live and Let Die"", a song he wrote in the '70s for a Bond movie of the same name. The song is used briefly in Dreamworks' latest outing for everyone's favorite Scots ogre. In the song he actually wrote this line: ""But if in this ever changing world in which we live in"". ""In which we live in""? Was he kidding? A great talent, but that is some lazy songwriting. I figure he was either exhausted, or under contract, as opposed to being inspired.And that's the problem with this entire movie. The writing is simply not up to par. The story is loaded down with so many different elements that it is impossible to develop any of them. You can almost see the writers thinking, ""Okay, now we've got a bunch of stuff for Shrek, Donkey, and Puss to do. Let's put in some stuff for Fiona and Lillian here..."" The result is that there's a script, but no real story. And the dialog with some exceptions, is full of the clichés they so happily lampooned in earlier Shreks. The result comes across as a 3rd or 4th draft. Andrew Adamson directed the previous two Shreks and has one of the writing credits here, but he did not direct it. I guess the franchise is so important now that it must be handled by two directors, neither of whom has Adamson's knack for timing. At various points in the evening, the pace was surprisingly ponderous.It's not unpleasant, as movies go. It's just disappointing when such an average film continues a series of such good ones."
18,Shrek the Third,3,18 May 2007,Truly Disappointed,"In all honesty Shrek is a kids movie, so they might love it, but the movie is a bomb for anyone over the age of fifteen. Personally the movie does not live up to the previous two. There was no conflict at all and the music was lame. Plus, the very few funny moments seem to surround the minor characters, Ginger bread man, Pinochio. Heck, even the shrek children were funnir than their parents. Even donkeys children were funnier and they did not speak. If you need to know anything else Shrek, the donkey, puss in boots are not funny in this movie. If you don't have a child, don't go to see this movie. It is not worth the ten dollars. Someone will eventually put the funny clips on you tube."
19,Shrek the Third,9,15 June 2007,Clever witty and a great addition to the series,"Humour is definitely the highest theatric art form, and Shrek is right up there at the top. Let's face it, it takes a lot more intelligence to write a good comedy than a drama or action film. In comedy, creativity and timing is critical. Shrek 3 has both! I own the first two Shrek DVD's and will definitely be adding this one to the collection. In general I do not like animated movies. Shrek is the only exception! As to the neigh-sayers, I would hardly know what to think. I mean, when B-Movies, like Sunshine for example, and horrors get a higher rating than this one, I guess there really is no accounting for taste. So if you like comedy and appreciate creativity and timing, go see Shrek. You will enjoy it. I would like to thank the creators for making this film."
20,Shrek the Third,10,24 May 2007,"I laughed, My four friends laughed, my sis laughed, my mom laughed AND my grandma laughed!","OK, I know this movie hasn't gotten the BEST reviews but I personally think it is absolutely AMAZING!There's humor in here for everyone, from simple baby fart jokes to a very well done reference to Paul McCartney's animated short ""The Frog Song"", and if you're concerned about King Harold (Fiona's frog father) passing away, You don't have to worry, I can guarantee you that you will NEVER find a death scene funnier than his. (Or a funeral scene for that matter.)The new characters are a wonderful addition to the constantly extending family, Merlin and Artie just to name some.The Dronkeys from the second film make several appearances and Dragon has much more screen time than she did in Shrek 2, a good thing for me.And if all of THAT doesn't make you want to see the film, you've got three absolutely adorable Ogre triplets to meet at the end of the film. (Sorry guys, they don't have names yet) These three little bundles of fun steal the scene they are in and are definitely going to be the new favorite characters of any little girl you bring to the film.For all you teenage girls out there; Artie is REALLY cute.Merlin will probably be more popular with the adults in your group, considering the fact that most jokes revolving around him are adult centered. (I found him disturbing to be honest)Highlights include; .Artie going into a full scale, fake crying fit when Merlin refuses to help them save Far Far away. .Puss attempting to do his legendary ""sad eye"" routine while in Donkey's Body. .Donkey singing the chorus of ""Cat's In The Cradle"" in order to cheer up Shrek after he worries about being a dad.And I'm guessing that the scene that will go down in history as the funniest scene in this film is Shrek's Nightmare about being a father, and the reactions that come from it.The actors once again to a WONDERFUL job with their voicing and Justin Timberlake makes for a nice fresh young addition to the family. Fiona's Gal Pals, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Doris (From the second film) are also wonderfully done. IF you enjoyed the first two films, then you will LOVE this one. Oh, but you MIGHT want to have an answer ready for the inevitable ""Where do babies come from?"" question if you bring a young child... there's so much talk about babies and preparing for them to come in this film (Donkey serves as an EXCELLENT source for some early on in the film new dad jokes) that they will certainly want to know."
21,Shrek the Third,3,5 February 2008,A sequel too far...,"Calling this third outing for the Shreck gang disappointing is giving it all the best of it. The characters lacked the freshness and pizazz of the first two. The voice characterizations were ho-hum. And who needs all those human-looking computer-generated figures? How about a little imagination here? Having Shreck become a father was a tired ploy used to juice up fading sitcoms. The cute baby ogres belong in early Disney. And what happened to Donkey and Puss-in-Boots? These two rollicking sidekicks are reduced to pratfalling bit players. Worse, for much of the movie their personalities are magically switched. This could have been funny for a quick bit, but it gets old fast. A clue to S-III's problems can be found in the lengthy list of writers, few, if any, of whom were involved in the first two.Worst of all...it's just not funny."
22,Shrek the Third,8,21 August 2007,Funny With a Great Message,"When Fiona's father and King of Far Far Away passes away, the clumsy Shrek becomes the immediate successor of the throne. However, Shrek decides to find the legitimate heir Artie in a distant kingdom with his friends Donkey and Puss in Boots to be able return to his beloved house in the swamp with the pregnant Fiona. Meanwhile, the envious and ambitious Prince Charming joins the villains of the fairy tales plotting a coup d'état to become the new king.""Shrek the Third"" is very funny, having a great message in the end and completely underrated in IMDb. There are many unfair reviews and I really do not understand what these users have seen to dislike in this animation. There are many new characters from the fairy tales, but all of them has space along the plot, in at least one scene, and I liked, for example, the Cyclops with his beautiful daughter or the lines of Captain Hook just to mention two of them. I saw a version dubbed in Portuguese and the dialogs are excellent. The soundtrack is a plus and I loved ""Immigrant Song"" and ""Baraccuda"" in the attack of the heroines. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Shrek Terceiro"" (""Shrek The Third"")"
23,Shrek the Third,1,12 May 2008,less than zero,"Shrek the third is a nightmare. I've seen bad films (like Battlefield Earth, or even Necro Files 2) but this is ridiculous. This pathetic sequel is pure rubbish. The good old characters writhe in a nightmarishly stupid environment. With some nightmarishly stupid and mannered new characters. Boring, slow storytelling, with predictable ""twists"" well done enough for the taste of an average newborn. The worst thing is that this film is serious as hell. No clues of irony or sarcasm against the stupid fairytale (or worst the stupid pop-cultural) clichés. This film is sweet and cheesy like a big budget Barbie Fairytopia sequel without the charm, innocence, and low budget smartness of that. Let's forget its technical precision, and you'll get one unusually dumb film."
24,Shrek the Third,3,18 June 2007,An hour and a half,"First thing's first: Yes, Shrek the Third features The Eels. Twice, in fact! Good, now that we've gotten past the important part...Shrek the Third is, well, an hour and a half. That is to say that if you want to spend an hour and a half, this is a great way to do it, but if you want to spend that hour and a half enjoying yourself, or maybe even not enjoying yourself, or hey, feeling ANYTHING, then maybe you should reserve that hour and a half for something that isn't Shrek the Third. Shrek the Third isn't bad, I don't want to say it's really even tedious. Heck, it actually spends the time allotted to it quite concisely. There's no real way to say it, though--this movie provides absolutely no reaction. It wasn't just me: none of the forty some-odd people in the theatre seemed to have much to do either, except maybe the couple in the back, who tried desperately to make their forced laughter seem genuine. Then again, it might be their fault--nothing kills a mood like forced laughter.Here's the deal: Shrek and Fiona are, you know, dealing with married life and stuff when ol' King Fiona's Father Whatsits decides to croak (get it, croak? He's a frog? Get it? Get it? I should be a Shrek writer). Shrek doesn't want to inherit the kingdom, as his step-father wishes, so he goes off to find Arthur Pendragon, the next-heir-in-line. Meanwhile mean ol' Prince Charming has some designs for taking the kingdom for himself. Also, Shrek is worried about becoming a father. Funny thing is, you know this already, as every single review, synopsis, and advertisement for this movie details this. You probably already know the ending. You probably know the middle. Heck, even if you haven't seen this yet, you know all the gags.But even that would be slightly acceptable (except knowing the gags) if this movie had any, howdoyousayit, um, ""umph"" to its jokes. Instead it is lazy and tired. Big bad Shrek just smiles and quietly shrugs off every situation that doesn't involve a spewing baby or a fart joke. Fiona worries around. Donkey, Puss'n'boots, Gingerbread Man, and Pinocchio reference the jokes that they're known for, and run around doing their supporting gags supportingly. In other words, everything that is is, and is what is expected, but isn't enough to really be, if that makes any sense. Believe me, it makes more sense than figuring out why this movie is making as much as it is.Anyway that's about all I can really muster to mention about something so unmentionable. Normally I'd recommend waiting for rental or discount theatres or something, but to be perfectly honest I can't think of a single reason to go see this movie at all. Oh, wait, yes I can: it features The Eels. Twice! --PolarisDiB"
25,Shrek the Third,9,15 June 2007,my daughter really liked it; I was pleasantly surprised,"I took my daughter, who is eight years old, to see this movie with a friend and she liked it a lot. she thought it was funny. Even though she saw the first two, she doesn't remember them, so she wasn't comparing it with the first two. The vote is my daughter's - a nine out of ten. I loved the first Shrek movie, but disliked the second. Since I had heard that this one wasn't going very good, I went with pretty low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. I actually laughed out loud at a few parts and found that the story flowed. I never once thought to glance down at my watch; I was pretty well entertained throughout. Not that the plot was ingenious, on the contrary, it was the same old story, but it had some smartly humorous lines, which I appreciated. I would give it a five out of ten."
26,Shrek the Third,8,3 June 2007,"Not the best, but still a great movie.","I loved this movie, and I think it was a great finale to the Shrek series. It wasn't the best movie that I've seen, but it was still a great movie.I loved how they brought back Antonio Banderaz as Puss In Boots, and I think he was my favourite in this movie, besides the lovable ogre Shrek. This movie made me laugh and cry in all the right places, at times it was touching and others times it was hilarious. Needless to say, it definitely tickled my funny bone.The story in this movie is very good, like I said it has it's hilarious moments and some tender ones as well. I'm not going to give away the story, but it was really good. Along with humor it also has villains as well, and even though I thought the movie was really great, i'm going to have to give Shrek 2 my vote.However, if your a fan of the Shrek series, this isn't one to miss, it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy."
27,Shrek the Third,9,22 May 2007,It depends how you look at it.,"Shrek the 3rd was a great continuation of the other 2 shrek films. When I watched this film, I got exactally what I was looking for. A new adventure and a load of laughs. Many people have criticized Shrek because of Shrek not being so fun. I thought the movie was great, and it really didn't have much flaws. What was wrong with it? He didn't end up being king, and that's what people wanted? Come on! He's an OGRE! He does exactally what he said he was always going to do. Live in the swap and live his life. What's wrong with that?!?! There was great action that took place in the film. It wasn't only fun, but it was humorous as well. Who doesn't laugh when Fiona and her gang is attacking the guards, and snow white falls asleep and they all trip! That was classic and many new ideas go into play in this movie. This movie was as good as it could be. We have to think logically. How many producers can make a 3rd sequel, and it becomes better than the rest? None sadly! Sometimes 1 or 2 can do it, but 3 can be a bit rough. The Producer did an excellent job for making a 3rd, and it not being a complete disaster. Not everyone is perfect! The movie is great if you love humor and shrek. If you don't, you're going to criticize the entire film."
28,Shrek the Third,7,20 May 2007,"As good as it gets, for the third in a series.","There is good things and bad things about this movie, but I'd say that to its credit the main problem with it was unavoidable---it's the third in a series, and the main idea has been used twice already, is familiar to everyone, and the freshness of it is gone. For some franchises, the pain starts already in the second (Men in Black comes to mind, or Analyze That), when really nothing is added to an original (and initially surprising) premise, and it is merely milked for what it's worth, with usually sad results.I don't think that was the case with Shrek 2, and neither is it with The Third---the writers still find enough interesting and original ideas to weave into the story, they use the old characters to good effect and add interesting new characters to provide some novelty. The dialog is up to the (high) standards of its two predecessors, and the animation is stunning.All in all, even though it won't set new standards for animated features like the original Shrek might have, Shrek the Third is an entertaining movie that delivers what it promises---a good time with the titular hero and his friends (and family), nothing more, but also nothing less."
29,Shrek the Third,5,15 June 2007,"Is the perfect ""Ordinary Sequel""....","The ""year of the sequels"" is on us and I go from sequel to sequel lots things are getting clearer to me, I'm finally coming to grasp with the ""all-prevalent and many yet to come"" SEQUELS.Broadly speaking there a 4 kinds of sequels.1)Based on epics where the story is long with lots of characters and stories, these usually have the problem of too much content and are the easiest to handle. (ex star wars, lotr, matrix?).2)Based on legendary characters and their adventures, these are somewhat more difficult but can always work by changing the plot every time (ex Indiana Jones,die hard,rush hour, ANACONDA, load of B movies like TREMORS).3)comic book and video game sequels (self explanatory).4)Exploitation sequels these are the toughest to handle and are as difficult to understand as the title I've given them.Based on the concept of extracting the maximum from a one off concept the got much bigger than anticipated, the original succeeded on multiple factors (Story, character, plot, concept, big action scene etc) which makes making sequels difficult but still lucrative. (Ex SHREK, potc, SPEED,ice age, JURRASIC PARK (multitype but the 3rd and maybe 4th fit here).This being an exploitation sequel the movie is quite clear.1)ONly some characters were developed in the original so way to much extra billing has been given to people that were once only side jokes (the loads of fairytale people).2)The plot is razor thin and weak and the very base on which the first one was made (spoof of the fairy tales) is now lost.3)The jokes are getting stale (how many ugly ogre, farting and gingerbread jokes can you have?).4)They had enough content for 1 movie they pulled of a very good second one, that kind of confidence is not good.5)Demographics take the front seat, adults, teens, fans, children, blacks, whites, etc etc everyone has been taken into account.Still this movie has its plus points.1)The main characters are still hilarious and you have lots of funny moments especially from Donkey and Puss in boots who are the stars of the film.2)The fatherhood track is really really funny.3)Chilren really seemed to really enjoy this movie although the demographically pleasing content is clearly unsuitable for children.4)The movie is short and sweet and really funny in pieces, if a dozen teasers were made they would all be funny.IT HAS BEEN BROADLY ACCEPTED THAT I HAVE THE MENTAL AGE OF A 12 YR OLD AND ME NOT FINDING THE SPARK IN A MOVIE MADE FOR MY AGE GROUP IS A PROBLEM.The complete package is ordinary at best except if watched with children which pushes it up-to good or even very good.Watch only if your a fan OR in a very good mood and ""SEQUEL PREPARED"".Keep low expectations and you may just meet or exceed them.-s typical exploitation sequel, LACKS THE SPARK, many jokes are stale.+/-s puss in boots and donkey given major billing (i like them).+s funny in pieces (though not as good as a whole), SUPERB GRAPHICS, short and sweet, VERY GOOD FOR CHILDREN.total 5/10 ( just fell below expectations (after factoring in sequel), with children and correct company may even reach a 7).PS ANS TO MY QUESTION HOW MANY GINGERBREAD FARTING ETC JOKES CAN YOU HAVE? NOT ENOUGH APPARENTLY THE 4 TH SHREK IS ON ITS WAY."
30,Shrek the Third,9,18 May 2007,"WAY Better Than The ""Professional"" Critics Led Me To Expect!","Being the third installment in a hugely successful franchise, this is usually where a run begins to show real franchise sickness. That, coupled with the horrid reviews submitted by the ""professional"" critics, I really expected something so convoluted and largely unfunny, as to make this nigh unwatchable.What I got, was a beautiful story, charming characters, top notch animation, chases, escapes, announcements, voyages, captures, deceits, death, birth, King Arthur, the second ugly stepsister (of Cinderella), true love (of course), and a wonderful execution of the story.I was quite surprised, actually, with the high level of comedic and animation quality and large level of entertainment derived from this work. This was a genuinely GOOD film! Don't listen to those other guys. If you love Shrek, you will love him even more when this is over.In fact, this is SO well done, that it continues the progression of better films. The first rated an 8.1/10, the second rated an 8.4/10. This one rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :."
31,Shrek the Third,,18 May 2007,What A Disappointment,"So, I just caught the 10 pm show of Shrek 3 and I gotta say, as a fan of the first two I was not impressed. In fact, I was very disappointed. It literally was the same movie the third time, and instead of infusing it with tons of fun and pop culture references like the second Shrek did, it just relied on its plot and genre convention to further it. There was ONE funny moment. The Led Zeppelin reference was good and was funny, but as a whole, the movie was a phoned in experience. Again, what a disappointment. At least most of the stuff shown in the trailer was in the first fifteen minutes or so and you get fresh stuff from there on out. The sad thing is that this fresh stuff feels dull and rehashed even though you've never seen it before.Terrible effort all the way around."
32,Shrek the Third,9,27 May 2007,"Just because it's not as good as the first two movies, doesn't mean it's bad.","This is the first review I write for IMDb, and the only reason I'm writing it, is to do justice to an excellent film, that has been severely underrated. Over the internet there are many negative reviews, and only a few positive ones.Yes, Shrek the Third features multiple story lines, none of which are developed well. However, Shrek the Third, more than makes up for lack of development with humor. Unlike the first two Shreks that had audiences laughing so hard they cried in certain places, this Shrek leaves the audience smiling from ear to ear. This, doesn't mean that the new Shrek doesn't have its funny moments, and it's ""if the joke doesn't stop soon, I will die laughing"" moments, because it does. On the other hand, some of the humor feels oddly out of place. For some reason, the jokes just aren't as funny as they were in the first two movies. Also, like I mentioned earlier, the film features multiple story lines that a ninety-two minute film simply doesn't have time to develop. The first two films (which were also around ninety minutes long), stuck to one or two main story lines, whereas Shrek the Third attempts to introduce at least three major story lines that are clearly defined.This is the first Shrek of the three that will leave a small feeling of dissatisfaction and shortness. All three films leave the viewer wanting more, but if the first two left this feeling out of pure quality, the third one leaves this feeling out of shortness and incompletion.But don't get me wrong -- it's still a great movie. Yes, it's not as good as the first two, but as long as you're watching the movie with a lower expectation than the first two, you will more than get your money's worth from the movie. It's a worthy sequel. Go see for yourself."
33,Shrek the Third,1,20 August 2007,Just awful.,"Having seen the trailer for Shrek the Third when I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and laughing at some of the jokes presented, I thought that it might be worth seeing, as I liked the first two installments from the series. But... I have to say it's the worst film released this year. Well, possibly apart from Bratz, but I'm not exactly planning on going to see that any time soon. It's just awful. If I could I wouldn't even award it one star.If you've seen the trailer and not the film - basically, that's all the funny parts of the film. So when you actually see the film, it's not even funny.Shrek and Fiona's relationship is so unconvincing that even Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale's in Pearl Harbor is more believable.There is a slightly enjoyable dream sequence of Shrek's, but I didn't laugh. I was so bored I couldn't move a muscle, but I had nothing better to do than watch the movie.If you're new to Shrek, it's probably better to rent this one first."
34,Shrek the Third,10,26 June 2007,so funny,"this was probably the best i've ever seen. i was least expecting Justin Timberlake. But overall, it was eminent. one of my favorite scenes is when Fiona says: Shrek... I'm -horn blows- Shrek... I'm preg... -horn blows but is snatched by Shrek- and then i liked the scene where Shrek had a million little ogrelettes in a nightmare. I wonder what the Fourth is about. it was most definitely worth seeing.it is still in the movies, so if you can afford it and want to, you can go see it. so if you plan to go to the movies, reserve seats for this one, get popcorn, laugh out loud and if you like it, wait for it on DVD and buy it."
35,Shrek the Third,1,8 December 2007,Everyone thought this was going somewhere... but it wasn't.,"I really didn't like this movie. It wasn't funny, the storyline was boring and it lacked the humour the original Shrek movies excelled at. There was no emotion to it, the part which was supposed to be sad just wasn't, and it makes you wonder why they even made a Shrek the 3rd movie in the first place.The jokes they used were dull, and the story was highly predictable. The storyline of Shrek going to find the next heir to the thrown was silly I thought, it is never even explained why Arthur is an Heir anyway. This movie is boring and really rushed. They could have done a lot better, it's like they didn't even try at all."
36,Shrek the Third,10,17 June 2007,"I'm telling you, this is really good!","Shrek the thirdThis movie was really good. It had a good story, good jokes and it followed the second movie good. Don't listen to others, there just not free spirited. You don't have to be a shrek fan to like this movie, and neither do you have to see the shrek movies before this one. If you see this, u'll understand and you will WANT to see the first and second shrek movie.I also liked that they included other fairy tale figures example: snow white, Rapunzel, Cinderella and many more!I'm telling you, this movie is really good and i'll sure you , you will love it so give it a chance! You won't regret it !So , don't care about what other people say or write about shrek 3, and take my advice and go see it. U'll like it! I did !"

38,Shrek the Third,1,30 May 2007,Shrek + 3= Hollywood out of (good) ideas,"SAVE YOUR MONEY! This review contains no spoilers because my wife and I didn't even stay to see the end. After an hour and a half of watching this boring movie and hoping it would redeem itself, we gave up. In that hour and a half there were maybe 3 funny moments at best. I cannot stress enough to you that this isn't even a FRACTION as good as the first and the second movie. And what will frustrate me the most is that parents will STILL take their children to this garbage and Hollywood will make their money back in the first 3 weeks of release. If the movie theaters are going to charge $8 or $9 a ticket and put commercials in front of the movie, the least they can do is have standards and not show this rubbish. This movie will sell a $100 million+, and Hollywood will send us a 4th piece of garbage. I know I'm ranting, but that's how mad I was that I spent money on this piece of trash. This is the summer of sequels, more than I can remember in recent summers. Spidey 3, Pirates 3, Harry Potter 5,Die Hard 4, Ocean's 13 (are they kidding?!?), 28 Weeks Later... Granted, a few of them may be good movies, one thing is clear; Hollywood is definitely running out of ideas."
39,Shrek the Third,2,30 May 2007,Hope springs eternal; but unfulfilled in Shrek 3,"If we can count on Hollywood studios for one thing it is their unfailing ability to deliver mediocrity when they think they have found the formula for a successful franchise. Formulaic is what they delivered in Shrek 3.The first two Shreks were irreverent and original. Almost uniquely in Hollywood they managed to entertain both adults and children without neither patronizing the former nor confusing the latter. In Shrek 3, except for a couple of scenes, there was barely a snigger from the audience of any age throughout the movie. With this one don't waste your money at the box office nor the movie rental store.Is it just me or has anyone else noticed the increasingly unwatchable number of movies Hollywood has been foisting on the public with their high-dollar marketing campaigns these past four years? I have walked out of three movies within the last three weeks; Spiderman III (twice - don't ask me to explain) and Pirates of the Caribbean; At World's End. They're boring. It is as though someone spoon-fed me a soporific at the beginning of the show; all I do is yawn until I get up and leave.Where is the hunger?"
40,Shrek the Third,1,19 November 2007,Shrek the Third: The second to last installation of an ever collapsing series,"The movie ""Shrek"" was the first movie I saw with my son, Eddie, when he was five years old. He loved it and I thought it was pretty funny too. Though it didn't have all the components of the short children's book it was based on the singing and dancing at the end made up for that. I gave it a 9 out of 10. Shrek 2 we saw together as well, when my son was 12 and my daughter 6. I thought it was pretty good, but Antonio Banderas was stepping down to a new low. (though not as low as spy kids) i gave it a 5 out of 10. But Shrek the Third's plot was choppy and poor old Eric Idle and a terrible role. And come on, Justin Timberlake playing ""Artie""? That was a terrible decision. I gave this on a 1 out of 10. My daughter at age 9 thought it was ""booring"". And my son (who went to see ""Spider Man 3) said he wouldn't go to it if you paid him. But at least it's something for Mike Meyers to do. It makes Eddie Murphy seem actually funny. And it stops Cameron Diaz from being a slut."
41,Shrek the Third,3,19 May 2007,Save your money and rent it...NOWHERE near as good as the originals!!!,"The subject says it all! I was COMPLETELY disappointed with this film. With Shrek and Shrek 2, I came out of the theatre laughing, sides aching, and reciting funny lines. When I came out of Shrek the Third, I just kept wondering what all of those people in the theatre were laughing about and clapping for at the end (maybe they were happy that it was over!). I have a sneaking suspicion that when those people wake up this morning, they are going to realize that this movie severely lacked the originality that the first two movies were overflowing with.I've seen a lot of reviews and comments that say the same thing, ""All of the funny parts are in the previews"", and to an extent, that's correct. I say ""to an extent"" because I never thought the previews were all that funny. I liked the Princess Army the best, but really they are a very small part of the film. I thought Cameron Diaz and Rupert Everett sounded bored, as if they are only doing this for the paycheck. And I hate to say this (because I'm a HUGE JT fan), but Justin Timberlake lacked charisma in his role, and his character was very two-dimensional. Oh yeah, and NOT ENOUGH PUSS IN BOOTS! Lets face it, HE was the best thing in Shrek 2! Don't get me wrong, kids are going to love this movie, because last time I checked it still had a big green ogre and a talking donkey. But most adults are going to be very bored. I've also seen a lot of comments on some boards say ""What do you expect? It's a KIDS movie!"" No, they aren't. Shrek and Shrek 2 are enjoyable for both kids and adults (I liken them to Spongebob Squarepants...there's plenty to keep the kids entertained and there are plenty of jokes for the adults too). I would equate Shrek the Third with Ocean's Thirteen: They only did it for the money and did not care about the content. Shame, shame..."
42,Shrek the Third,1,15 May 2016,Gave me cancer,"I know what I said, but something has happen that has caused me to realize life isn't worth living, by the end of this review the cancer will have taken over my body. To all of my fans I apologize, but I have no reason to live and this will be the last thing I ever do. For those of you that may be confused, I wrote a Shrek 2 review explaining how Shrek 2 cured my cancer, and at the end of that review I said no Shrek the third review as every time I talk about it, the cancer comes back. Well, today I went to watch Shrek 2 for the 666th time this week, but when I opened the case, I was appalled. There was no Shrek 2 there, but somehow Shrek the third was. After this event I now realize that there is no God, as no God would allow such an atrocity to occur. Already my cancer is at stage 2, I might not make it through this. Shrek the Third is the hot girl you meet at the bar and she seems amazing, until you go in for the kill and five seconds in you realize you've already contracted HIV, but you finish the job just to see if by the end it was all worth, and I can tell you one thing Shrek the Third is not worth the HIV and cancer it gives. Everything about this movie is awful, there is no I need Hero moment like in Shrek 2, and the movie didn't even take my advice on adding the running of the Jew. Shrek the third may have hurt Shrek's legacy even more so than that punk ass kid from Shrek is love, Shrek is life did. I still remember the first time I saw the movie, after Shrek 2 I've never been more excited for anything in my life, but after 20 minutes into the movie, I needed an injection of I need a hero as my cancer was coming back, but this time stronger and with a hint of HIV. Why the hell does Shrek have a nightmare about having his kids, not only that but how the hell did he predict so accurately how they would look like when they were born? Also, how the hell does Donkey even get with the dragon, I bet the dragon has never orgasm-ed during their relationship. cancer update: stage four. How stupid are the people of far far away land, like how you just gonna let Prince Charming do that stuff again, like how you still trust this fool? I really don't think anything could have saved this movie besides maybe the running of the Jew, even then probs not tbh. It makes my cancer go wild knowing this film is apart of the Shrek legacy. Shrek I love you, and I'm sorry the writers let this happen, it's not fair to you, but please promise me you'll always be Shrekly. To all my fans, I'm saying good-bye, I'm offing myself, we all know it should be the kid from the Shrek is love, Shrek is life, but somehow it's me that will ending his own life. If I'm wrong and there is a god, how can you live with yourself? How can you put us Shrek fans through this movie? How could you let my Shrek 2 get switched with Shrek the third? God you're really the devil if you do exist.And with that I say goodbye to the world, and Shrek forever after. Love Shrek Boy 5"
43,Shrek the Third,2,10 June 2007,"Let's Quit While We're Ahead, Shall We?","Like most movies that comes in threes, ""Shrek the Third"" is a waste of time. Right now, there hasn't been an interesting flick during the first half of this year, as it was last year, but now I am waiting to see ""Knocked Up,"" an original adult comedy amid the needless three-quels of ""Shrek the Third,"" ""Spiderman 3,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End,"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen."" The original ""Shrek"" was an uncomplicated charmer. ""Shrek 2"" was even funnier, adding touches of glitz and glamour with the kingdom Far, Far Away looking like a Hollywood Scene, and ""Shrek the Third"" is a forced, convoluted mess. And for the first time did I actually fall asleep through bits and pieces of this yawner.Okay. So we all know about Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and swashbuckling Puss N Boots (Antonio Banderas) and all the happy things that will happen to them at the end of the movie. In the first and second movies, they all seemed happy working together, but now they seem bored and would like to just get together for lunch. The late great film critic Gene Siskel quoted, ""Is the movie more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?"" Well, let them have lunch!In ""Shrek 2,"" we also got to know King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews), Fiona's parents. They return, but Cleese is wasted as the King Frog that ahem, croaks, for hokum, so that Shrek becomes King. For more hokum, we get a new character, a nerdy picked-on teenager named Artie (Justin Timberlake, infamous for ripping Janet Jackson's outfit on the air for the Half-Time Superbowl Show three years ago, which Jackson called ""a wardrobe malfunction."") whom Shrek wants to crown King. Timberlake does not sing and his nerd image contrasts the Super Bowl image he gained notoriety for. Other returnees from Shrek 2 include Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), reduced from prince to dance hall entertainer, Doris the barmaid (Larry King, better and shorter in his cameo from the previous movie) who has more to do, but not so interesting, and the three blind mice. Regis Philbin has a cameo as Mabel the ugly barmaid, but his voice is muffled and unrecognizable from the Regis we all know and love on television.And if you think that's enough, there are more needless characters on the way. We get Cleese's Monty Python cohort Eric Idle as the bumbling wizard Merlin who unfunnily switches the voices and personalities of Donkey and Puss-In-Boot as a gimmick. Idle probably did this movie as a favor for Cleese, or was it as excuse to hang around with him. Come on, you two guys can go out for Bangers and Mash for lunch. Then for good measure we get Saturday Night Live and Secondy City comics Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, and Amy Sedaris as fairy tale heroines who also have nothing else to do but look good and act like Charlie's Angels (starring Cameron Diaz) in the showdown to rescue Shrek and save Far,Far Away from a takeover by the arrogant Prince Charming. The biggest gimmick of the movie are the ogre babies and the half-donkey, half-dragon babies. The latter babies came at the end credits of ""Shrek 2,"" when Donkey's lady-love dragon returned to greet Donkey, and they were lovable there. Even the babies are uncute and annoying here, with belching, crying, and vomiting constantly.No Shrek movie is complete without a closing number. Eddie Murphy gets to perform Sly and the Family Stone's 1970 hit ""Thank You Fa Lettingme Be Mice Elf Again,"" with the credits in the form of baby blocks, and only Donkey and Puss N Boots dance. It's more fun to watch the whole cast and more fairy tale characters sing and dance to ""I'm a Believer"" and Antonio Banderas does a wonderful job singing ""Living La Vida Loca,"" getting all the other characters to dance.So now, do we see what happens when things come in threes? Boredom, that's what. Even worse, there could be a Shrek 4 or 5 for the little kids only, and not for adults as well, like Shrek 1 or 2. Adults need to be entertained with animation as well, but now ""Shrek the Third"" seems like kiddie matinée fodder."
44,Shrek the Third,7,20 May 2007,Shrek the Third is Second,"The second Shrek film to me was one of the most formulated, only made to make money sequels I've ever seen. The original film was terrific, but number two screamed ""lets fill the pockets of Dreamworks SKG."" Number three was obviously made with one purpose in mind; making money, however, the film is a pleasant surprise.The negative reviews of Shrek the Third have been abound, from the papers to IMDb. I personally enjoyed the film and found the animation to be stunning. The layers on the human faces were superb and the animation was throughly fluid. The film has a lot of subtle jokes and innuendo for adults. If you're like me and couldn't stand the second movie, you might throughly enjoy Shrek the Third."
45,Shrek the Third,2,18 May 2007,Not as funny as the 1st and second movie.. it's loosing its touch,"I was somewhat disappointed... I was really looking forward for tummy-aching jokes, funny scenes, just like the 1st and second movie... But somehow, I expected too much.. I ended up thinking that maybe, they ran out of.... everything! I can say that Kids under 12 might laugh out loud but hey, they're kids. If you want to know why I was disappointed, watch it yourself... Don't get me wrong, I'm still a shrek fan but the third movie really isn't funny.. there are some scenes that might make you smile or giggle a bit but all in all, it can't be compared to the previous 2 movies. I hope the upcoming 4th movie will blow me away... more power shrek and may the power of the mud-bathing be with all of you...("",)"
46,Shrek the Third,8,18 May 2007,Amusing enough second sequel to the hugely popular films.,"When Princess Fiona King's Father (Voiced by John Clesse) died, Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is supposed to be the next King but he doesn't want the responsibility. So Shrek, Donkey (Voiced by Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Voiced by Antonio Banderas) goes on a trip to find the next future King, which is the late King's nephew Arthur (Voiced by Justin Timberlake). But Shrek finds out that Fiona (Voiced by Cameron Diaz) is pregnant. Shrek has fears of fatherhood. But the cruel Prince Charming (Voiced by Rupert Everett) is planning to be the next King of Far Far Land with the help of another villains, who have the chance to get back on top. When Fiona, Her mother:Quenn Lillian (Voiced by Julia Andrews), Cinderella (Voiced by Amy Sedaris), Doris (Voiced by Larry King), Sleeping Beauty (Voiced by Cheri Oteri) and Snow White (Voiced by Amy Poehler) are also in danger for their lives.Made by first-time filmmaker:Chris Miller with Co-Director:Raman Hui made an amusing comedy to the second sequel to the hugely popular ""Shrek"" films with superb computer animation design. But the story is surprisingly weak and it is somewhat short on laughs. But it is saved by good characterization by the talented vocal cast. Fiona, Queen Lillian, Cinderella, Doris, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White has some amusing funny bits but it is Donkey and Puss in Boots steals the show. This is certainly going to be one of the biggest hits of 2007. This is the least satisfying of the three movies but it is still fun, nonetheless. (*** ½/*****)."
47,Shrek the Third,10,27 May 2007,I love this movie,"A lot of people (critics) say its not really funny or whatever but in the theater everybody was laughing. Because its really funny. You can take your whole family to go see it,cause its something everybody will enjoy. They actually don't give Julie Andrews hardly any lines but the lines she does do, its great. I ts certainly a must see. Even if you didn't enjoy the first 2, you will definitely love this one. Actually to me it was funnier than both two combined. You can watch all the time for a long time really, that is when it comes out on DVD. The funniest part is when Shrek has this nightmare of all the babies Seriously I give it a 100% A"
48,Shrek the Third,9,20 May 2007,An excellent addition to the Shrek films,"More innuendo, more laughter, more... drama? Sure... drama. Shrek lovers will adore this film. I was skeptical upon seeing the previews ages ago, but once I heard from others its OKness, I gave it a chance. It was much more than I expected. Sure, the third movie in a trilogy is hardly ever the best, but this is still an excellent film. Oh, and by the way, take your kids. But be prepared to get asked a lot of awkward questions afterward. The sexual references run frantic, as in most of the Shrek movies, however this one seems even more geared towards teens and adults. It's worth the money. It's worth the time. You won't stop laughing. You'll love it."
49,Shrek the Third,2,3 July 2007,Poor addition to the series,"I'll be straight and say it now ahead of the rest of my comment, the third installment in the Shrek movies is inferior to both of it's previous titles in the every way. It's quite a disappointment to have this title made the way it was. Everything about it is predictable but that's not the bad thing, both of the earlier Shrek movies were fairly predictable but were successful in executing it in a funny, comedic and sometimes suspenseful manner. Shrek the Third completely fails here. It is predictable without being funny, comedic or engaging. Shrek and Fiona also both suffer from character derailment and act unlike themselves from the previous movies. In Shrek 1, we saw Shrek easily beat up shinning knights in armor, take on crossbow tooting elf goons in the second film, but here in the Third he easily gives up when confronted by a few soldiers. Meanwhile Fiona has become practically useless. Other parts of the story are so contrived. Fiona, her mom the queen and several other fairy tale girls are locked up halfway through but do nothing to escape until the end when the Queen conveniently knocks down the jail walls with her head. Heck why didn't she do it earlier? It's almost as if the writers stuck them in there and couldn't think of a way to get them out and ended up with this instead.And then there's the villain, Prince Charming. I honestly think it would have been better if they created a new villain from scratch because Prince Charming was portrayed as a vain airhead in Shrek 2 and it's so unbelievable when he easily turns a tavern full of depressed fairy tale villains to his side with a few words. Even more insane, at the end, the lost heir Arthur, also with a few naive words, convinces said tavern villains to throw down their weapons and make up.Ultimately, this leads to the rather poor and naive message of the movie regarding what people think of you and how it does not matter what other people think as long as you know yourself. Well guess what? Pretty much all the world's mass murderers, dictators, serial killers etc etc acted like that.All in all, I felt my money was wasted on this movie. The only upside is that I watched it on the same day I caught Transformers: The Movie which allowed me to see just how much of a mish-mash, half-cocked job they pulled on Shrek the Third. Don't watch this movie people, especially Shrek fans. You WILL be disappointed."
50,Shrek the Third,5,21 May 2007,"Was a big Shrek fan, but not anymore.","Dreamworks has had a great series going with Shrek. The animation has been stellar, the stories unique and original, and the humor off-the-wall. The movies have been a delight and a welcome change from the standard sappy Disney fare (not that there's anything wrong with those). In fact, the first Shrek helped usher in the new age of CGI movies, and finally proved that someone other than Disney/Pixar could do it well. Shrek has been a wonderful series and one of my favorites - until now.Unfortunately, this latest entry in the series just does not deliver in the same way that the first two did. While the first two had original ideas and were packed with satire and adult humor, this one is just boring and predictable and barely has a few chuckles. In fact, it seems as though they simply wanted an excuse to bring all the characters back together. Who can blame them? They're making heaps of money. But the characters have lost their charm. Donkey and Puss n' Boots have gotten boring, and don't even have many good one-liners. They've added some other side characters - princesses from other Disney movies - but they're lame. Even Shrek isn't very funny anymore.On the positive side, the animation is excellent again. But I'm finding that even that isn't as impressive as it used to be. Honestly, I think Meet the Robinsons blew this movie away. The animation was a little better, the story was more interesting, the characters better, the moral issues less cliché, and it was even funnier. The story in Shrek 3 revolves around 2 new unoriginal plot points. For one, Fiona wants to have babies and Shrek is freaking out. The other is the king is dying and they need to find an heir to the throne. They tell Shrek that there is a distant heir, Arthur, that he can go and find. This leads to an interesting twist on the old Arthurian legend. Lancelot and Arthur are still in high school, which provides for some humorous jokes about high school during the middle ages. They even run into Merlin, voiced by Monty Python alum Eric Idle, who is a retired crackpot magician at this point. But these few interesting moments can't save the overall dreariness of the story.This movie does have its funny moments, but the problem is like most movies these days, they were all in the trailer. And maybe I see more trailers than the average person, but to me the jokes have gotten pretty old by the time I finally see them again in the actual movie. I loved the first two Shreks because of their awesome skewering of fairy tales, Disney stuff, and modern things. They would lampoon things like Burger King, Starbucks, Disneyland, etc. But that's pretty much all gone in this movie. There's a couple brief Bambi-bashing moments, and Snow White using her animal-calling songs as a weapon, but that's about it. Even the cool surprises like the fire-breathing dragon or Fiona turning into an ogre have disappeared. What we're left with is a standard mediocre formulaic kids movie that will bore adults. Of course, it will still gross hundreds of millions of dollars because kids have no standards, but I'm disappointed because I expected so much more."
51,Shrek the Third,7,18 May 2007,Third Time's the Charming,"Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) have truly settled into married life, although for Shrek, the solitude of wedded bliss is somewhat hampered by the duties of a royal, having Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) as captains, and worst of all, the truly scary prospect of being trapped in all of the above by the passing of King Harold (John Cleese). The ailing royal frog does leave his son-in-law with a timely loophole--the existence of a truly distant relative. While Fiona, Queen Mom Lillian (Julie Andrews), and the rest of the female court attempt to ward off the ambitious yet juvenile Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), who has recruited the greatest fairy-tale villainy to his cause, the guys' latest ""whirlwind adventure"" brings them into contact with the proposed heir apparent-- classic high school loser Artie (Justin Timberlake).If you fell in love with the mock product-placement rampant in the second film, or suffer from a short attention span, it's probably best you wait on this one. The essence of the Shrek universe is there for the fans to enjoy, however, with the true star of the film being how the characters have advanced--both technically and dramatically. A higher level of detail is noticeable, from the fluctuating real estate of Far Far Away to the hair of the chinny-chin-chins on the Three Pigs (look well, it's actually there!). The in-jokes are rather clever, but the filmmakers have taken a bold step by showing enough faith in the characters to actually explore them, as they did in the first movie. Although this is technically the longest of the three films, it seems somewhat short--since everyone has to travel a long way in a short time, and admittedly, the subplot of Charming devising a takeover by an alliance of fairy-tale villains harks back to earlier Shrek wannabe ""Happily N'ever After""--if something appears in your film that reminds us of another film, that other film should at least be...well, good. However, there are more good points: Timberlake doesn't ruin things--the character actually suits him, and rejoice concerned fans: he doesn't sing! Eric Idle provides his typical offbeat diversion as a Merlin whose robe is embarrassingly too short. All in all, things are kept enticingly light, eschewing wild stunts and nutty gags for the sake of a story. A move that deserves kudos on it's own. Bottom line, Shrek's about comedy more than anything else. Did I laugh? Yup, and quite a bit, so that made it worthwhile. If there's a single audience for the film, it's probably new parents--if you love these characters, check out their kids!!"
52,Shrek the Third,6,11 May 2007,All the same and still funny!,"I've just came back from the press screening, so I'll try to take the hard work to be one of the first to comment on this title.So, 2007 can definitely be named as the year of third installments. We've just seen Spidey... New ""Pirates"", more Ocean's friends and even new adventures of Bourne are on the way. One should consider, what can be easier for everyone there in business - producers, filmmakers, cast, even for audience: it worked once, it should work again (if we don't make it worse). A lot of money involved, so we can't risk anything. We gonna change the plot slightly, we will use the approved storyline, use the same actors and add some new jokes, that should work the same way they did before. Sometimes it's true, sometimes it doesn't happen.It's all because of the main thing. A really interesting comedy should be fresh and and have something completely new about it. (You know, the guys who make long-run Simpsons or South Park know a lot about such things)In other case it's gonna be the some sort of a clone and many, many laughs will be caused by recalling the first two. Third Shrek tries really hard to be funny. And we laughed like crazy a lot of times during the film (big thanks to Banderas and Murphy - they kick ass here again!). But a huge part of humor feels like being stuck in given ""Shrek world"", unfortunately because this world can be bigger, and it's really underused.Characters could virtually be put into any fairy tale atmosphere, and we could meet some fresh new heroes, but all we get as a plot line is something like tooo abstract war between everyone who's good and everyone who's evil. And the main thing i'm missing for - is any plot twist, anything that surprises us, viewers. Maybe it's all because of my high expectations, but if you wait for a completely new Shrek - it's not your movie. But if you decide whether rent and watch again first two Shreks or go to the theater and watch the new one - go ahead and give it a chance, it's still funny, even though we laughed at all this jokes many, many times before..."
53,Shrek the Third,6,19 May 2007,Well I had fun,"If you judge ""Shrek 3"" on its own, it isn't as terrible as some seem to think it. Sure, the film is pointless and mediocre, dismembers some of the qualities that made use fall in love with the characters in the first place, uses babies as an excuse for another film and merchandising...yikes that doesn't sound so good. But the truth is, I was entertained by this film that seemed like a really good straight to video sequel. It's humor sure was clever enough to exceed ""Shark Tale"". Perhaps that isn't a huge compliment, but the animation is up to its usual quality and, to my delightful surprise, the new additions to the Shrek cast didn't overtake the story of have any moments of grating 'cuteness'. The film still has those laugh out loud moments.But still, this film doesn't touch ""Shrek"" and even dwells in the shadow of the less stunning ""Shrek 2"".I think this film is a clear sign that the series should come to an end. The writers have run out of ideas, and another attempt would surly be another weak attempt that would have to be condemned. The whole film is treated as seriously as Fiona's amphibious dad's death. When I left the theater, I didn't come out thinking I'd just seen one of the most anticipated films of the year, and if it wasn't for the hordes of children around me, I surely wouldn't have given it a second thought. Still, the film is worth seeing...once."
54,Shrek the Third,1,18 May 2007,Blatantly misogynistic.,"Why, exactly, does this film focus on Shrek's decision about whether he wants to be king? Shrek is not the heir to the throne. Fiona is. You remember Princess Fiona, right? She was in the previous two films, in which she kicked butt and took names. In this one, she barely has the nerve to tell her husband that she's pregnant; maybe it's too much for me to hope that she would take charge of her own kingdom.I couldn't enjoy this film because I kept wondering when Fiona, previously an empowering role model for girls, would make her position plain about whether she wanted to be queen. The pseudo-""grrl power"" scenes in which fairy tale princesses gear up to fight villains did not make up for this glaring plot hole, though the writers seemed to think that they did."
55,Shrek the Third,2,5 June 2007,Pointless,"One of the worst films I've ever seen, Shrek the Third is a tragic example of greed and a blight upon the series. Despite its labeling as a comedy, Shrek the Third almost completely fails to be funny in any respect. Genuine laughs are so far between they seem to be the product of blind luck rather than any talent in writing.Just about every scene and every plot point is tired and completely predictable. This film spouts off cliché characters and scenes in a never ending flow, and almost nothing contains any originality. The script feels like it was written by copying large portions of other movies and adding a few sad gags and pathetic attempts at slapstick humor.Visually, the film is mostly the best looking of the three, with some very detailed scenes and characters and the occasional (seemingly random) photo-realistic object. However, apparently the animators forgot how to do fire, and in this entirely computer generated film, the computer generated fire looks pathetically post-production, completely out of place.Overall, this film is painful to watch, with horrendous clichés and predictable gags that grate on the viewer. You're better off watching either of the first two films again. Only the credits of Shrek the Third are worth watching, creative and fun and vastly outshining the film itself."
56,Shrek the Third,4,18 May 2007,All the fun is gone,"Well, you probably would watch it anyway because it is difficult to part with lovely heroes, but the third movie is really the worst. All the good parts are gone. No action (remember fight with knights, or dragon chase in the first one? Castle assault in the second? Absolutely nothing in the third. No music (well - there is a music, but nothing like well-chosen and favorite tunes of the first one). Not so much fun/jokes. Very very mediocre.I mean - this is what made the first two very successful - action, music, fun. Not ordinary tale as well. And I can't say the story is very great in this case as well. Don't know where the producers were looking at - I mean they couldn't be happy with this. It is clearly 'redo' diagnosis right off."
57,Shrek the Third,,16 May 2007,The best possible animation production,"A neutered donkey is just a braying ass as far as I'm concerned, and in Shrek the Third Eddie Murphy's once fast talking, acidic, contrary sidekick Donkey becomes just another concerned friend of Shrek. Therein lies my primary criticism of an otherwise crowd-pleasing tale of the Ogre (Mike Myers) and his wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz), tiring of taking care of the Far, Far Away kingdom while the frog king (John Cleese), Fiona's father, is ailing. Upon his death they search for the next-in-line heir to take the burden off the Shreks (""I am an ogre. I'm not cut out for this,"" Shrek tells his wife).This amusing fairy tale with major characters from great tales such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Snow White, and Captain Hook, among others, has a smart theme about being yourself despite negative attitude from others. It is carried through most of the film, starting with people's initial revulsion at seeing Shrek and not seeing his humanity to Arthur becoming king despite the ""loser' appellation given by his high school peers. The parody of a Beverly Hills high school in which girls use ""like"" in every sentence with high pitched, ""Oh-my-God"" voices is funny material. The opening vaudeville show, medieval style, is ingenious as is the raucous sequence in which the Shrek and Fiona struggle with their royal costumes. Of course, DreamWorks has incorporated the best possible animation production, right down to silky hair bouncing perfectly.Despite the sweeter characters in Shrek the Third and the streamlined, focused plot, I miss the torrent of pop-cult references in the first and second editions. I'm still threatening to go back to savor all the references, the ones I heard and the many I missed.But I have too many new films to see, the older ones drifting far, far away."
58,Shrek the Third,7,18 May 2007,It's no Skrek 1 or 2,"I liked the Skrek's however this one is not to par with the other two. It's not as witty, funny, interesting or clever as it's two previous efforts and I was a bit bummed about it. What made it enjoyable enough was the fact I do enjoy the characters and the spirit of the films however I want something to be 'at least' as good and painfully it was not. Just seemed to be missing that certain something as well as a better script. The concept was fine however that was the strongest point. I will say the CGI work and the expressions of the characters were really outstanding. A lil scarily realistic in certain shots. They did improve on that aspect of it yet that's not where the focus should have been. It's a entertaining ride yet not nearly in the league as the first two. So if you go in with lowered expectations, then hopefully you'll come out with no less than feeling your time was well enough spent."
59,Shrek the Third,8,17 May 2007,Third time's definitely a charm!,"For me, the first 'Shrek' stands as one of the best animated films ever made. Yeah it was satirical but you connected with the characters. The disappointing 'Shrek 2', on the other hand, felt emotionally detached albeit kinda funny. But I honestly think that Dreamworks is back on the ball with 'Shrek the Third'.Saw it today first showing at the local multiplex (I live in PR, and films debut a day before US, yey!) and I was pleasantly surprised. My expectations were a little low because of S2 but I have to say I laughed...a lot! Eddie Murphy kinda got annoying after a while but Banderas' still got it as Puss-in-Boots.Mike Myers did okay, nothing amazing. So did Justin TImberlake as King Arthur (aka Artie). Personally it was Eric Idle who stole the show as the mentally imbalanced Merlin. Also John Cleese has a sidesplitting cameo as the Frog Prince.I smiled through the entire movie (the Disney parodies) as I did through the other two, but this one had some laugh-out-loud moments the second lacked. And the personal dilemmas of Shrek and Artie were well done.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised with 'Shrek the 3rd'. I say it's a couple notches below the original but a lot better than the second one.8/10"
60,Shrek the Third,9,19 May 2007,"Stay ""Far Far Away"" from this pile of...","Wow, what a disappointment this movie was. If you liked the first two, you might want to consider skipping this one. THIS is not a true ""Shrek"" film. The storyline is completely worthless. The dialog is dry and boring. The characters were boring and didn't interact well like they did in the previous two films. One thing I liked about the other TRUE Shrek films is in the background there's always something happening. This sad attempt?? Nothing, na-da. This one needs to be taken back to the drawing board. It's like some studio exec said, ""Come up with something in 5 minutes...we'll make a 1 1/2 movie about it and push it out to the public..they'll like it...it has he SHREK name on it."" This was truly a load of crap and they should be ashamed for ruining an otherwise great franchise."
61,Shrek the Third,4,23 May 2007,Don't expect the same level of adult humor as the previous two.,"Third time is not the charm, unfortunately, for the Shrek series. First, Spiderman and now this. Don't get me wrong, the previous movie Shrek 2 is my all-time favorite animated movie because its humor appeals not only to the kids but also to adults, which is quite rare. The witty dialogues, funny new characters, and loads of satirical pop culture references really made that one.I don't know what happened to Shrek the Third. Maybe the writers have now run out joke materials. The laughs are now few and far between, I'm really surprised. The new characters are simply not funny, with the exception of Merlin the Wizard (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame). Even the regular funny guys like Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots has now lost some of their charm. I miss their numerous side splitting one-liners and antics.A popcorn movie to bring the kids. Just don't expect the same level of adult humor as the previous two."
62,Shrek the Third,8,23 October 2014,Pretty Good Third Film,The story of Shrek the Third (2007) is not quite as good as the first or second films but the comical lines and visual comedy is still right up there with the first two movies.Some of the new characters are not quite as enduring and memorable in Shrek 3 but they are quite likable and entertaining.The animation in this 3rd installment of the film series is still awesome.All I can really say is I enjoyed this 3rd film. And I do recommend it if you enjoyed Shrek and Shrek 2.8.5/10
63,Shrek the Third,9,28 December 2010,"The Worst Shrek,But Still Quality Family Entertainment,","Shrek The Third is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline,a very impressive voice cast and brilliant characters.It is without a doubt my least favourite of all the Shrek movies,the story just isn't as good and more that the jokes miss more often this time around,but its still a great animated movie for the whole family to enjoy,and like the other two there are plenty of jokes for younger and older members of the family to laugh at.If your a fan of the first two Shrek's,you will definitely be disappointed by Shrek the Third,but you will will still laugh and enjoy very much.After the death of Fionas father,Harold,he wants Shrek to take his place as king of Far Far Away,but Shrek wants to return to his old swamp along with a pregnant Fiona,so Shrek,Donkey and Puss In Boots go to go in search of Fionas cousin Arthur (voiced by Justin Timberlake),but a Prince Charming seeking revenge gets in the way."
64,Shrek the Third,9,15 November 2010,My Favorite Shrek!,"Shrek the Third is my favorite one in the series even though I have yet to see the fourth one. This movie received so many negative reviews and I honestly cannot see why. If there was a Shrek movie to receive negative reviews, it should have been the second one.This time in the series Shrek is in line for the throne but he doesn't want to be king. He travels to seek the next heir, a boy named Arthur. When they come back to Far Far Away, they find that Charming is up to no trouble and he has taken control of the whole kingdom.The characters again are a welcome addition to this movie. Of course Donkey remains my favorite. I also liked Puss in Boots. The other characters are likable too.Overall, this is my favorite Shrek. I can't wait to see the fourth one. I rate this film 9/10."
65,Shrek the Third,,22 April 2010,"Not Horrible, But A Weak Third Entry","""Shrek 2"" was box office gold and it became the highest grossing animated film to date. DreamWorks obviously got ""Shrek The Third"" fired up. Now ""Shrek 2"" was no winner, it was a formulaic sequel with constant pop culture jokes fired at the audience. It was good, if you were a middle schooler in 2004 that usually avoided animated films. But if you're an animation buff or someone who knows what makes a good animated film, it's ultimately a misfire. It wasn't extremely bad though. ""Shrek the Third"" is significantly worse.""Shrek The Third"" begins where the King of Far Far Away dies and the next king in line is supposed to be his nephew Arthur. Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots go to find Arthur. They to go the academy he attends, as he is a teenage boy that's picked on by everyone. From there, the story is a muddle. Meanwhile, Fiona is pregnant and Artie turns out to be rather difficult. Also, Prince Charming is back with a vengeance and wants to get rid of ""happily ever after"" by joining forces with all the fairy tale villains.Despite its constant jokes, the film falls flat. Nice animation also can't save it. To make a good animated film, you need a great story and a great script. Shrek himself was way different in this film. It basically took the big flaws out of ""Shrek 2"" and had little redeeming values. The jokes are all pop-culture references and what-not, therefore you have a movie that panders to the masses.It may have not been necessary, but ""Shrek The Third"" was still a halfway-fun diversion to watch if you have kids, but it is a big disappointment compared to its predecessors. Of course, it was a big success (though it couldn't top ""Shrek 2"" and a few other big animated films) and the ""Shrek"" series will keep going as long as it makes money (That's DreamWorks for you). Of course a fourth one is coming despite the fact that people might be a little sick of Shrek by now. A 5.9 out of 10."
66,Shrek the Third,7,16 June 2008,Best of 3.,"I hated the first Shrek because it was crude and insulted several of my favourite 2D animations. I also found the main characters annoying. I did not understand the mass appeal, since I rarely laughed. It was a long time before I watched Shrek 2, but I'd seen a toy Dronkey and was curious. How were they going to explain it? As it turned out, they didn't and the dronkeys were just a cameo. Loved them though. Loved them enough to buy Shrek 3.Yes!!! More dronkey action. And some green babies too. It's a shame Shrek and Dronkey's children didn't get more screen time, but there were a lot of characters, old & new, to squeeze in. This time I was surprised to discover that I was laughing a lot more and sympathising more. There was less crudity and mockery. I didn't enjoy the bitching Princesses, but everybody else was appealing.You can't always judge a DVD by the films that came before it. 8/10"
67,Shrek the Third,6,30 April 2008,Much Of The Same But Still Entertaining Enough.,"Following in the footsteps of the first two animated ogre tales, Dreamworks' Shrek the 3rd promises much of the same that has gone before. However, although lacking in surprise and awe after the first two, it is still an entertaining fast-moving ride chock full of film references and fairytale send-ups. Pretty much every scene is a mock up of classic Disney titles or fairytale legends plus there's a bit more thrown in for adults, with subtle nods to the likes of the Six Million Dollar Man, Rosemary's Baby and Monty Python. The voice cast again is pretty much top notch, with Eddie Murphy's Donkey and Antonio Banderas' Puss providing most of the laughs and as expected the animation is great. Unoriginal and cliché at times but there's is plenty to enjoy from this final ogre instalment.6/10"
68,Shrek the Third,,7 January 2009,looks stunning but falls well short of the first two films,"Shrek the Third is simply not as good as the first two Shrek films. Clearly, a lot of care was taken on the technical side as the CGI looks gorgeous, but the script leaves a lot to be desired. Some scenes work and some don't. The ratio of hits to misses falls well short of Shrek and Shrek2. The entire Artie storyline is middling at best and drags the film down. Also, Donkey and Puss have precious little to do. Plenty of jokes are recycled from the previous films. While kids will probably enjoy it, adults should skip the theatrical version and wait for DVD or the Television premiere.Overall 6/10"
69,Shrek the Third,6,30 November 2008,"Get off the throne, already","A very tired Shrek (Mike Myers) tries to recruit a kid Artie (Justin Timberlake) to replace the recently deceased king (John Cleese) so that Shrek does not have to assume the throne. Prince Charming (Rupert Everet) meanwhile decides to install himself as the new king, and imprisons all who defy him, including Fiona (Cameron Diaz), her mother (Julie Andrews) plus Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White, Rapunzel, Pinocchio, 3 Blind Mice, 3 Little Pigs and the Gingerbread Man. Charming also eventually imprisons Shrek and plans to kill him on stage before a live audience. Will Artie save the day? Or will Shrek get the ax? Who cares? The jokes are as tired as Shrek. Not even Puss (Antonio Banderas) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) can save this unnecessary, plodding sequel. There is one funny bit involving walking, talking trees that are straight out of THE WIZARD OF OZ, but that's about it. And I will admit Shreks's offspring, seen at the end, are adorable -- but of course. SHREK 3 is for small children and Shrek fans only."
70,Shrek the Third,8,27 December 2007,Good film,"I think everyone had high expectations of this movie, I mean, after the first movie, then the second beat the first, so we all thought that the third would be brilliant, and granted, this didn't fulfil that, but so what? It still did a great job as a movie, and was quite fun. Didn't beat number two though, as it didn't live up to some of the slightly crude humour. But anyway, good film. The other disappointing this about this movie is that several of the characters were annoying and you wanted them to get hurt, for example, Merlin, but he didn't. Things like that got annoying, and the Arther kid they brought into the movie was kinda annoying as well. But all in all, this is an entertaining film, just tone down your expectations slightly."
71,Shrek the Third,7,8 December 2007,Not the best but still good.,This shrek movie is not the best out of the three but it is still pretty good and really worth seeing. This shrek movie is funny maybe not as funny as the first two but still funny. The story to it is good not as good as the first two but still really good. Once again the same actors are in it and they still do a good performance just like what they did in the first two. They have some knew characters in this one. Most of them are good and funny just like the rest of the characters in this movie. So make sure you buy or rent shrek the third because it is really good. I am sure you will enjoy this movie and have a fun time watching it.Overall score ******* out of ********** *** out of *****
72,Shrek the Third,7,2 December 2007,A very good sequel,"As far as sequels go, this is very good. As far as Shrek films go, this is also very good. Like all the others, this one is entertaining, funny and exciting. Despite the plot being slightly unoriginal, this film's plot is very well-planned and fast-paced.Compared to the second one, the old characters in this ""Shrek"" film are exceedingly good. Shrek is often a lovely happy old ogre and a lot nicer and more gentle than in any of the other films. Donkey is still an amusing donkey - luckily not too annoying! Princess Fiona (always an ogre) in this film has a strong, quite eager and often relaxed personality, which very much suits her. Unfortunately, Puss in Boots doesn't have the chance to do nearly as well as he did the second film, but still has the same good personality (possibly a little more Spanish!).The new characters are very well done. The wizard (voiced by Eric Idle) is an incredibly amusing character with a funnily worried personality. Artie is a nice guy, although when provoked can produce quite a temper. Overall he is a good character.While King Harold (now a frog) is ill, Shrek is taking responsiblities of running the kingdom and feels he is DEFINITELY not cut out to be a king. Just before the poor frog comes to his place in heaven, he tells Shrek that besides him, the only heir is a wee boy called Arthur. Is he cut out to be king..?Enjoy ""Shrek the Third""! :-)7 and a half out of ten."
73,Shrek the Third,7,29 October 2007,"Shrek 3, a pleasant surprise after all the hideous hype.","I have just been pleasantly surprised by Shrek 3. Trying to ignore all the hype around it, I tried to watch it (on DVD) as the second sequel to one of my favourite films, nothing more. Although it comes nowhere near the quality of the first film, it does try to recreate its pleasant pacing and isn't overstuffed with easy film/commercial/real life-reference jokes (I'm looking at you, Shrek 2). And if one pops up, than it got more laughs out of me than Far Far Away ever did in Shrek 2. The Medieval high School was just hilarious, especially the mix-up between today's teen slang and Middle English. As an English student, it really appealed to me.I really liked the dialogue between the characters like in Shrek 1, it's something I kind of missed in Shrek 2, where the characters just jumped from one crazy situation to the next with a few one-liners her and there. What I did miss, was the bickering between Puss and Donkey. Both characters do in fact get way too little screen time, and that's a big mistake since both characters were the highlights of Shrek 2. Somewhere near the end they do get in a situation that brings back some of the comedy gold of Shrek 2, but it's too little and too late.All the old characters get to do something funny, but in the end they are all just great to see as old friends you know from the past. It's nice to see Donkey, Puss and Shrek get along so well with each other, but there's nothing more they can do to fill another film. We know the characters, and they have all found a place in the world they live in. I have gotten all I wanted out of the overall storyline, I'm happy with the way things are for the characters now, and I don't mind that the third journey had to replace the ""insert joke every few seconds""-mentality of Shrek 2 with a bit more storytelling. There were still plenty of big laughs left, I can tell you.Ultimately, Shrek 2 was funnier, but I think I like Shrek 3 better. I felt that this adventure was more meaningful for all the characters, and I know that this is the part where a lot of critics thought it wasn't necessary. But if you ask me, Shrek 3 was unnecessary. But since they really had to make a Shrek 3, I think they did well to make the adventure a bit more meaningful and make it really count in the end. It's only too bad that the message is the same of the previous two films, we get it already.The only thing I really didn't like was one of the major characters they used to tell us again that you must accept yourself and others as they are. Artie was a really un-Shrek character. His speeches were dull and Justin Timberlake does nothing to make the character more likable. Of course, he has little to work with. I liked Justin timberlake's part better as a poster in Shrek 2 with the text ""Sir Justin"". It was funnier than anything Artie said or did in Shrek 3. Let Shrek, Donkey or Puss do the talking, dude.As far as I'm concerned, Shrek 3 was an unnecessary sequel that still worked for me with some good humour and the characters being as charming as ever. The story was more meaningful for the main characters. The end of this adventure, even though repeating the message of the previous films, provided me with satisfying closure on the story of the happy Shrek family. Too bad that another unnecessary sequel is coming, undoubtedly with even more hype and more dull characters like Artie. Sadly, the Shrek franchise seems to be the most inspired thing coming from Dreamworks Animations."
74,Shrek the Third,10,20 May 2007,The Third One's Always Good,"And Shrek the Third doesn't disappoint us. Probably the funniest in the Shrek trilogy, it was also the longest. However, this will not be the last in the saga. ""Shrek 4: Royal Engagement"" and ""Shrek 5"" will follow. How exciting! The film follows the sides of good and evil until they finally clash together. Prince Charming (Rupert Everret) rallies a gang of fairy-tale villains to help him take his 'rightful' place as king of Far Far Away. Meanwhile, Shrek searches for an heir to the throne after King Harold (John Cleese) dies. Will Charming and the villains succeed? Will Shrek get back in time to halt his efforts. Will the rightful heir to the throne of Far Far Away be found? Find out by watching the most hilarious entry in the trilogy, Shrek the Third. See it at your local theater. It's been in your swamp since March 18th."
75,Shrek the Third,10,18 May 2007,This movie was as good as the other two!,"I don't know why people are saying ""it lacked that special something"" or ""not Shrek 1 or 2"". I loved it. It was as good as the other two. It had everything: A good storyline and really great action, adventure and comedy. I love all the films equally. I have all the merchandise. I'm a huge Shrek fan, you might say. Justin Timberlake wasn't even bad. It was a good choice for his voice. I love the cast. All the same people with the right voices for each character. Don't listen to what those stupid critics say. Go see the movie and have a good time. Critics have their own taste in movies. They probably didn't like Shrek from the start. I love the Shrek series and I can't wait for the 4th and 5th Shrek to come out(including Shrek The Halls and Puss In Boots: The Story Of An Ogre Killer).So go see this movie. I LOVE SHREK!"
76,Shrek the Third,1,22 May 2007,Bad casting,"Justin Timberlake ruins this movie its just incredible bad casting.however as whole the film is OK not as good as the previous two instalments, Eddie Murphy and Antonio Badaras save this film as they did in the previous ones. In all honest it could be just cut to the scenes there in and nothing would be lost from the movie. on the whole this seems to be aimed less at kids and more at there parents. This film lets the other two down immensely its nearly as bad as godfather 3.Hopefully there end the franchise with this one rather than make a desperate grab for more money."
77,Shrek the Third,5,19 May 2007,The King croaks...and Shrek revolts.,"The third in the animated comedy series. Not on par with the first two, but still very funny and a hoot to watch. Shrek(Mike Myers) comes to the realization that being king is not meant for a smelly ogre. When Princess Fiona's(Cameron Diaz)father(John Cleese), the King of Far, Far Away, croaks; Shrek is next in line to rule...the likable green Shrek sets out quickly to find the rightful heir to the throne, Artie(Justin Timberlake). Shrek is joined by Donkey(Eddie Murphy)and Puss in Boots(Antonio Banderas)in finding Artie and persuade him to accept the crown. As Shrek leaves on his journey, Fiona lets him know that he is going to be a father. Meanwhile in Far, Far Away, Prince Charming(Rupert Everett)sets things in motion to claim the royal title he thought he was cheated out of. The obligatory potty humor and lightly suggestive content scores the PG rating. Other voices featured: Eric Idle, Julie Andrews, Ian McShane and Larry King. Will Shrek and triple diaper duty continue?"
78,Shrek the Third,1,27 August 2007,kill shrek already...,common just shoot me already... these are jokes i do everyday... i must be obnoxious.no creativity... nothings new... the 1st in the series was incredible. just milking this for all its worth. i cannot blame anyone for finding some type of entertainmentbeing that there are very few things that our young people can watch without having to explain things to them. Dreamworks... please move on... i think we get it... maybe this should be a TV series at this pointit is at the dollar movie where i live. that is the most i would pay to watch this movie
79,Shrek the Third,10,18 May 2007,A GREAT movie for the whole family...,"My husband and I went to see this without the kids and we thought it was excellent. It still has the ""hidden"" adult humor that we've grown to love about this series. It's creative and never gets boring. There's not many ""family"" movies out there that please both parents and children. I thought it was well worth the money and I would spend the money to go see it again! Another great movie by Dreamworks"
80,Shrek the Third,8,10 May 2007,Totally New Scene,"Shrek 3 is GREAT! It was just as funny as the other Shreks, with some scenes that really hit you with funny gags, i.e. pop references. They used a lot of 70s-80s songs for the grownups to have a ton of laughs also. Some of the humor I found surprisingly a bit too adult but Shrek 3 was able to pull it off without being too PG-13. I wish they could have shown more of Fiona's character develop, ever since Shrek 2 she's kind of stepped aside a bit. ALL the voice actors were AMAZING, Justin Timberlake did a surprisingly amazing job at King Artie. The princesses are hilarious and the other characters such as the gingerbread man still have that same comedic relief. Shrek 3 also uses different themes that weren't seen in Shrek 2 and Shrek 1. Major themes such as just being yourself! The dying frog king was the funniest part for me."
81,Shrek the Third,6,17 May 2007,Shrek getting average,"Shrek the Third is fun. If you watch it in a cinema full of admirers of the green ogre, Donkey and Puss in boots, you will be entertained. Still, it has its flaws. I can understand and appreciate that the producers realized their series is too much filled with jokes that won't stand the test of time: in two decades, most of the movies that are evoked will be forgotten so the jokes will not be understood. Also there are too many movies that copied this method. So they decided to make the third outing almost totally devoid of movie in-jokes (yes, there are a few but you can watch the movie without realizing any of them really was). No Matrix or Mission:Impossible this time. And it is not a problem. The problem is they could not find out what to give instead of these movie jokes. (Yes, there are jokes and even good ones, but actually when you will laugh in the cinema will be mostly when they reprise jokes from the first movies - you will laugh because they were funny at the first time so they are still funny, but not because they are original.) And what they found out is just the opposite of the spirit of the first two episodes of the series. They give morals, they give speeches about taking the responsibility and being yourself no matter what others think, and they provide a new positive hero who is a handsome average boy. No, this is not usual for a Shrek movie, it is usual for the movies and stories Shrek made fun of previously. And what about fairy tale bad boys helping the bad guy and fairy tale good girls (""Disney princesses"") helping the good? Is it how it should be in Shrek or maybe only in Happily N'Ever After? In a real Shrek concept it would be the princesses who plan an attack on the ""ugly ogres"" and the bad guys who help the ogres. Still, I can accept the story while it is not that revisionist take we could get used to in the Shrek movies, but all this leads to a movie, which, like the once much more ogre-ish main hero, is becoming old, family-friendly and sticking to conventions, like an average man when he gets a family."
82,Shrek the Third,4,18 May 2007,The only character able to compete against Pixar quality-wise falls flat on his face the third time around,"Just how many more jokes and songs is the Shrek franchise going to borrow before it loses its identity and becomes confused as something else? Shrek the Third is a third offering of family entertainment that contains a slew of adult humor, pop culture references, and music from all kinds of genres and time periods. In other words, it is more of the same, and it is becoming old. Like a joke going bad, this film fails to deliver consistent laughs and fails to bring out the sympathetic moments of the original Shrek that started the anti-Disney campaign. While they lay off Disney's back a little, the anti-Disney content is still practically everywhere. If you listen close enough you can hear music imitating the theme to Pirates of the Caribbean. The magic (or anti-magic, if you want to be correct) has disappeared, sending the third installment into another typical animated farce that we have seen time and time again.With the king (John Cleese in a short role) suddenly croaking (har har har), Shrek (Mike Myers back to his old self) is the heir to the throne. The problem is, he does not want to rule a kingdom, he would much rather be back at the swamp with Fiona (Cameron Diaz in a surprisingly minor role). Things get worse then a few more ogres might be in play in the future and a frustrated Prince Charming (fantastic Rupert Everett). With the help of Donkey (Eddie Murphy, loud and proud) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas scene-stealing again) Shrek attempts to find another heir to the kingdom. There's a lot going on, the writers were not afraid of packing the film with a lot of conflicts. Unfortunately though, some of them result rather abruptly and even in a lazy manner. The voice acting isn't half-bad, with Banderas and Everett leading the way and Justin Timberlake being rather mediocre. As a matter of fact, the casting was quite good with several cameos and most of the voices from before making a return.What kills Shrek the Third is the cast of underused characters and overused characters. The supporting cast in the first two Shrek films return and provide the most laughs, yet is limited to mere cameos. Even Fiona, a strong and important character in the original, is quite limited the third time around to make room for others. The other princesses, voiced by the female cast of Saturday Night Live, failed miserably in bringing any smart or humorous material. With limited screen time, the chemistry amongst the cast is also lacking, most notably the main three (Shrek, Donkey, Puss). The insane amount of borrowed material and jokes does not help at all, as we can draw content from Toy Story 2, Happily N'Ever After, Blazing Saddles, Looney Tunes, and more. Then we have some jokes that have worn out its welcome a long time ago, you'll know exactly what it is when it happens. Shrek the Third became a repeat of past viewings of other television shows and movies.The first act had potential, as they did not rely on pop culture but instead on physical humor and sight gags that does not involve burping, farting, or throwing up (which apparently and sadly runs the film to the very end). Then the film started collapsing in entertainment value when all the random music started kicking in, when the pop culture references start flying, and when the plot holes start appearing. Shrek the Third has easily the most plot holes in the series, and also isn't as well written as the other two. Shrek has been watered-down into a franchise just for the kids, as they aimed low in its humor. Replacing satire is gross-out humor that fails. The pacing wasn't as good; the climax was rather anti-climactic, and even the ending seemed rushed and effortless.Bottom Line: Shrek is nothing like the entertaining ogre we met years ago. The main characters stopped being funny, the supporting cast remains funny but very hidden in the midst of all that is going on, and Shrek the Third just practically fails overall. It is weaker than the second installment (despite the much better beginning) and is not even close as good as the first. With too many characters and running time under 100 minutes, we have quite a convoluted mess that did not know how to end so it ended suddenly, when you least expect it. Shrek is starting to lose his appeal to the mainstream, even though some can argue (*raises hand*) that he started losing it in the first sequel. Let this franchise die; don't make it dip any lower in quality. The kids may have a blast (even then that's a stretch) but the adults should all be quite disappointed with this lackluster blockbuster. Shrek the Third: No more please, three is quite enough. Thank you."
83,Shrek the Third,7,18 May 2007,I wasn't disappointed nor was I elated,"I am a fan of both Shrek 1 & 2 and well I think this one fell short of its predecessors. I enjoyed it, but maybe I was expecting more..being as it took 3 years to complete. My kids (son 5 and daughter 2) enjoyed it, however my true Shrek fan (daughter 2) was not as into it as much as 1 or 2. The music selection was OK, the graphics/animation was different, I am not sure if it was as smooth as the previous. I would have liked to see a bit more sarcasm and quick wit. I think the film didn't come through with showing relationships between the characters. I liken it to Harry Potter/Azkaban and how the director slaughtered it, by detaching the relationships between the stars."
84,Shrek the Third,5,18 May 2007,Shrexsploitation,"Sadly, this two hit dynasty has run out of steam. There is no recognizable plot, the funny bits aren't terribly funny, and the characters are flat. The animation is still good, but even there, the movie makers are just reusing the effects from the first 2 films (Charming does the hair thing again). There is something about Shrek having a baby, something about a young boy becoming a king, something about a villain trying to get his revenge. Snow White does a dorky Led Zeppelin solo. When that runs out of steam, they set the next lame bit to Barracuda by Heart. Everyone lives happily ever after. No matter how hard they try, star power and special effects just can't cover up the stale material and the lack of creative effort.In the end, it probably doesn't matter. Our theater was packed; Shrek ran on 7 screens on opening day. With great animation and a huge fan base, the studio thought it could afford to be lazy. And that's exactly what this film is: lazy and disappointing."
85,Shrek the Third,7,17 May 2007,Many Delightful Moments,"There are many fun and laugh-out-loud moments in the film. However the story isn't as good as the previous two.For one thing, Shrek and Fiona spend most of the film apart -- and their love story is the heart of the Shrek saga.The subplot about villains banding together and taking over the kingdom was already done last year in ""Happily N'Ever After"". They even used many of the same fairy tale villains. Hmmmm...Sadly, John Cleese has only a brief scene, but his Monty Python buddy Eric Idle steps in and does a good job as Merlin. Justin Timberlake is fine as Arthur, the teen who would be king.The Donkey/Dragon babies are adorable. Be sure to stay for the fun closing credits. They'll send you out singing and dancing."
86,Shrek the Third,3,18 May 2007,"A funny movie that is lacking something monstrously important to be a true ""Shrek"" film","I got out of classes this fine Friday for some special school occasion, so the entire middle school went over to the movie theater to see Shrek The Third at a discovered matinée showtime at the local theater. A week ago, when the faculty first announced we'd be seeing this instead of Spider-Man 3, I was pretty excited. I mean, come on, it's Shrek--you really can't go wrong with the charming, funny, brainy-as-hell movies coming out of Dreamworks, with voice talent by Eddie Murphey, Mike Myers, and Cameron Diaz...right? Wrong. Let's start by examining what Shrek The Third DIDN'T have. The first ""Shrek"" was loved by me--and pretty much every other Shrek fan who is mature enough to understand its witty humour, special heartwarming touch, and its meant-for-adults-that-goes-way-over-little-kids'-heads type content. The filmmakers of the first Shrek really had some awesome material up their sleeves--stuff that truly made a fantastic movie, and if I do say so myself, one of the best animated films ever to be pumped out of LA.The second Shrek, ""Shrek 2,"" was a slight decline in entertainment. It was still funny, and still had half a tank of movie magic gasoline--not a full tank like the first Shrek possessed, but half--good enough to make a decent and enjoyable film, but not nearly enough to quite match up to the original.And now, sure enough, as every successful movie must have, a second sequel. ""Shrek The Third"" is a complete and utter mess. Remember those special little tricks the filmmakers had up their sleeves for the first Shrek, and even some for the second Shrek? Well, they're all GONE--not missing, no, they're completely GONE. What made the first two movies enjoyable for me had completely been used up, proving to us moviegoers and critics that sequels to big blockbusters are gigantic wastes of money.Sure, it was FUNNY. It was really funny, I laughed a lot. But where was the brain behind the comedy? Where was the backbone, the spine, the rock where instead of St. Peter builds the Church, where the filmmaker is supposed to base the movie on, where was that? It wasn't there--it was like the filmmakers pretended it was there, when it really wasn't, and just ignored that fact and continued to make the movie with no worries. A ""ghost comedy"" I like to call it. Now I know what you're asking yourself--how could I enjoy a ""ghost comedy"" like ""Anchorman,"" but not this? Well, this leaves me into my next point.The direction of the movie was an embarrassingly bad joke. It was like the director was sitting back smoking bongs and drinking Guinness while the sound editors filled in for him. The story didn't flow like the first two, it wasn't interesting, and after a while, I just got bored with the whole thing and started thinking about other, more important aspects of my life. The storyline felt like the film caterer used a knife to chop up it into little bits of segments and then mixed them around, making the movie almost as pointless as ""Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector."" A stupid comedy that is directed well can be a VERY FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE FILM. But when it's not? The essence of the film drains away to leave just empty-hearted and hollow laughs that don't mean anything.AND THE ENDING! OH GOD, THE ENDING! What were they thinking?! I was pretty much asleep! They tried to make it funny and give the audience the warm fuzzy feeling they felt in the first two movies, and they failed miserably! It was almost like they tried to justify the crappiness of the rest of the movie with a satisfying finale, and ended up doing the opposite and making the rest of the movie even crappier than it was. Which is truly saying something.Overall, ""Shrek The Third"" got me out of class, and that really was the only good part about seeing it. A huge, and unfortunate, disappointment. Save your money and rent the first two. I hope there's no ""Shrek The Fourth."""
87,Shrek the Third,5,4 January 2008,"In all that is good and whole, will the madness never stop?","I went because I was going to a sleep over at my grandparents with my two younger cousins (one of them was four, the other ten) I said yes, because I would be bored at home. Bad idea. The name is corny, the only part I laughed at wasn't even a full laugh out loud laugh, just me saying ""that was funny"" then life went on. The plot was thin, Justin Timberlake scared me as the dorky teen, and the music sucked big time (Except for Live and Let die and even then it was bad). It was awful. I guess you can say that violence can comfort me sometimes. It comforts me with LOST and Lord of the Rings. I bet when I'm a mother, and I'm at the grocery store, there will be a cheap DVD bin and there will be Shrek the Third, and my kid will say ""what's Shrek?"" and I won't even be able to answer how sucky it was. Do yourself a favor and save your money."
88,Shrek the Third,6,1 July 2007,"No originality + No plot + Annoying Characters= a very poor Shrek film, and a poor in general movie","Shrek was possibly the greatest animated film franchise of all time (money-wise anyway) until 3:50 p.m. today, when I started watching Shrek The Third after a lengthy advert prologue. The film started with Shrek and Fiona getting into a variety of funny situations in order to look after the kingdom of Far Far Away for an ill King Harold. The film then goes on to a weirdly funny death scene where Kind Harold dies. After being proclaimed by King Harold that he wants Shrek to be his heir Shrek decides the burden of becoming king is far too great so he, Donkey and Puss go off on an epic (10 minute) quest to find the next heir to the throne, an annoying, obviously unpopular teenager called Arthur (or Artie...hmmm). That's the plot, except for the return journey and the climatic (yawn) end scene obviously copied from the second film.The film is not poorly executed (the animation is great and there are some funny moments) however there is so little plot that the film becomes dull and plastic. The majority of the characters are incredibly annoying, especially the whining, whinging princesses' who add little, as well as the pointless cameo from Eric Idle as Merlin (who's main purpose appears to cut the action and film time down about 20 minutes) and Justin Timberlake, who played a stereotypical underdog role, which seemed completely out of place in a franchise usually seen as ridiculous and not serious at all.The major character flaw was that there were too many characters, with too little screen time meaning none of the characters (except for Donkey or puss) were actually likable. By the end of the film you realise that Arthur (Justin Timberlake) starts out as a major character, but in fact he becomes incredibly minor and unimportant. In fact the film would have been fine if many of the characters were not there at all. Many just seemed to have been added into the story to forward the plot in someway, a lazy attempt at disguising the non-existence of the plot itself.Also the film relies too much on the other two pictures. In reality Shrek 3 is pretty much an add on to the second film. There is so little difference between the films (other than the watery plot) that I began to wonder whether Shrek 3 is comprised of rejected concepts from the second installment (ah-ha dreamworks your devious plan has been un-earthed). What especially annoyed me about this film (apart from Justin Timberlake's and Eric Idle's pointless appearances) was the lack of originality. The Shrek films are renowned for an original perspective of ideas which are conventional stories taken apart for comic effect. This film had no evidence of this, not a single one, except the perception of bratty teenagers, and bratty princesses, which were both stereotypical and completely humourless. The film took all the ideas from the first two films, and then took them for granted. Unfortunately because of its lack of any new ideas, the film became one-dimensional.All in all while the animation was good and some of the scenes being quite funny, the film was ruined by its incredible lack of originality, as well as its annoying sub-characters and non-existent plot."
89,Shrek the Third,7,29 May 2007,A Nutshell Review: Shrek the Third,"It has just been the start of the summer season, and the sequels are raking in the millions, despite lacklustre reviews no doubt stemming from familiarity and expectations built from successes of the predecessor films. Still, they are raking in the millions, and possibly the largest franchises in recent years converge onto 2007 as they feature their third movies, and leaving the door open for possibly more to come. Spidey 3 had too many characters, as did Pirates 3, as they both seek to expand the fantasy world they belong to, which to some worked against their favour as it meant less screen time for some beloved characters.And we welcome back our favourite giant green ogre Shrek, who in its third installment, expands its mythology as well with the introduction of various characters from the Camelot tale, most notably those of Lancelot, Genevieve, Merlin and of course, Arthur himself. As we last left out heroes, Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are back to living with royalty in the kingdom of Far Far Away, now with pals Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and family.Now if that's a handful, wait till the story moves forward with Shrek and the faithful buddies going on a mission to seek out an heir to the throne, Artie/Arthur (Justin Timberlake), who certainly doesn't bring the sexy back to the crown, and you must watch this as once again the filmmakers turn on their creativity and cunningness to develop a character (and other characters) in ways you'd never expect them to behave. Which is what most audiences would have enjoyed with the previous films, though this time round, there seemed to be a line drawn on the ground not to overdo the references to pop culture, sight gags and rounds of puns.And the villainous Prince Charming is back, with ambitions to be King Charming, and here's where the story fell a bit short, as it adapted from the other animated movie Happily N'ever After, where the bad guys who always seem to have their luck run out, group together and forcefully take over the kingdom. It's a pity the majority aren't memorable, given that we're already so familiar with the good guys, and they just fail to add more colour, instead it became repetitive with Charming's narcissistic behaviour. Boring.But there are good moments in the movie though, and I can't get enough of those princess types in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Despite its expanded cast, the story still managed to put focus on our main trio of Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots, at the expense of Fiona who becomes more of a side with her anxious maternal instincts kicking in. The story did feel at times to drag along, especially with Shrek playing surrogate father of sorts, and its trying real hard in attempts to weave in some feel good, moral messages, slowing down the pace, and at one point, tried to go back to its zany ways with some inane happenings, as if a sudden jolt of a reminder not to bore with preachy stuff.Perhaps Shrek 3 might have lost some of its charm, but it definitely is miles ahead of the poorly animated Legend of the Sea. It's a no brainer which animated movie to watch this school holidays."

91,Shrek the Third,8,26 May 2007,At least as good as Shrek 2,"As is often the case, I'm out of sync with most of the critics and movie-going public. C'est la vie...I loved the first Shrek and gave it a 10 vote. Shrek 2 was a bit of a disappointment and I only gave it an 8, although many critics and other folks seemed to like it better than the original. It was edgier, I suppose, but that's not what floats my boat.As with number 2, this wasn't up to the level of the original, but I gave another 8 as equally worthy to carry the franchise banner as #2. Like #2, it had a few spots that fell a little flat, but overall I liked it a bit more than #2.As with all Shrek movies, the devil is in the details and this was rich with goodies, some of which will only become obvious on the 2nd or 3rd viewing. If I had to score #2 and #3 side by side, I guess that, individually, #2 did have a bit more going for it. However, #3 did turn away from edginess to the sort of innocence that made the original so charming, so it simply felt better to me.[..minor spoiler alert..]One big disappointment was the lack of a closing musical number as in the first 2 movies. Donkey & Puss did have some over the credits business, but it was a letdown from the previous Shrek films."
92,Shrek the Third,8,26 May 2007,Pretty darn good!,"Unlike the first two ""Shrek"" films, ""Shrek the Third"" is getting roasted by many critics. Most are saying it's pointless, mediocre, not as smart, and not funny. While I agree with the first three comments, the part about not being funny is not true in my book. The plot goes something like this: When his new father-in-law, King Harold falls ill, Shrek is looked at as the heir to the land of Far, Far Away. Not one to give up his beloved swamp, Shrek recruits his friends Donkey and Puss in Boots to install the rebellious Artie as the new king. While Shrek is away, Prince Charming gathers a band of fairy tale villains to take over Far, Far Away, and it's up to Fiona to stop them.You can probably tell just from reading the plot that the filmmakers are running out of ideas for ""Shrek"", and that this film was made only for the hundreds of millions it would make. This stands to reason. Director Andrew Adamson of the first two ""Shrek"" films doesn't return for this one, which might explain why it wasn't as good, Chris Miller, who hadn't directed at all previously, took over. Many jokes are a rehash of things we have already seen before, and not done any better. Still, I laughed quite a bit, and I know you will too.The entire original cast is back yet again  probably for the last time  to voice the huge line-up of characters. Antonio Banderas as Puss-in-Boots once again steals the show, as does new character Merlin, voiced by Eric Idle. Another welcome addition is Amy Poehler, Cheri Oteri, and Maya Rudolph from ""Saturday Night Live"" as cranky princesses. One character I didn't like was Artie voiced by Justin Timberlake, he is the annoying, bratty, and stupid prince who just gets on your nerves.The animation is excellent as always, and for every two bad jokes, there was one good one a school pep rally tells you to ""Just Say Nay"". So, like ""Spider-man 3"", which wasn't as good as the first two either, ""Shrek 3"" is entertaining. It's a good way to spend 90 minutes, and for the most part, you won't regret it and your kids will adore it. Critics need to realize we don't see movies like Spidey and Shrek to watch a great movie, we watch it to be entertained. But frankly, I don't think critics even know the meaning of the word."
93,Shrek the Third,5,20 May 2007,Even ogres need good jokes in the script to be funny,"The first two Shrek installments were a hard act to follow: this film proves it. Although there are some sporadic moments of comedic fun, this film just somehow lacks the spark of the other two movies, and falls short.The structure and script content of the whole thing seems rushed, as though they failed to develop some of their innovative ideas for the maximum comic potential. For example, the fairy tale land high school idea could have been utilized for some good material, but instead there are only a few random jokes, some of which don't work. In the same way, neither the popular returning characters nor the new ones are properly used. Donkey, Puss in Boots, even the Dragon hardly do anything except get tied up by baddies, and have few funny lines. Merlin, the princesses, and the villains are all introduced with some fair sight gags, but then the script wastes each of them, too. The death of one character is sad, yet is awkwardly played for comedy.On the plus side: the animation and backgrounds are superior, and the baby ogres and baby donkey/dragons are cute.The film does little to advance new elements to the Shrek story, and has only occasional laughs. Just average, and falls far below the standard of the first two Shrek movies."
94,Shrek the Third,6,14 August 2017,"Spaceballs 2- . . . I mean, Shrek 3: The Search for More Money","Easily the weakest of the three movies, plotwise (I know there are four, but this is enough), leaving most of its charms to the ever-increasing background characters. Almost like clockwork, whenever I'd start to drift, Gingerbread Man would show up and steal the scene; or Merlin (Eric Idle); or Arthur (Justin Timberlake).It's clear that the machine is running on fumes at this point, but it's not really a dud; there are a few bits of hilarity. You just have to wait around for them.6/10"
95,Shrek the Third,4,7 August 2017,Disappointing,"What made the first Shrek enduring & charming has been completely lost over the course of the sequels, resulting in a lackluster third installment. Animators claims at advanced technology allowing them to produce better imagery & detail is very questionable, as to ask ""so what?"". The film is packed full of load, OTT gags & physical comedy to keep you awake, as well as entertain the kiddies with the bright colors & action - but for a more mature audience at whom the dialogue & jokes of the films are aimed, it neither impresses nor amuses. In fact the characters seem to have taken a step back, becoming more slapstick in their behavior & approach. I can't help but feel that the voice cast realize this, & each deliver a bored & tired performance. The comedy is recycled from it's predecessors, it's direction a mystery, it's intentions non-existent. Dreamworks should have quit whilst it was ahead, & should stop cussing on advertising it's star casts & work more on story & script."
96,Shrek the Third,5,3 August 2017,The Unnecessary One.,"This film really disappointed. I loved the first two, the second one was the high point which is rare for sequels. This film focused less on Shrek and more on Justin Timberlake's take on a version of King Arthur that I don't even think the kiddos would have wanted. I have to wonder, Justin Timberlake was referenced slightly in the second film, could that have had anything to do with his presence in this movie?I feel the main problem with this film is the lack of Shrek, yes Shrek is throughout the film but rather than have the lovable Shrek that existed in this film, we focus more on his family dynamic which intertwines with the plot line of Arthur. Shrek becomes somewhat of a secondary character in his own franchise no longer the happy go lucky ogre but a (sigh) even more complex and developed character. Don't get me wrong, you need to flesh out a character, but I think you can go a little too far with just about anything, like drugs...I feel if they had tossed the whole ""fatherhood"" plot line the film would have been markedly better. Perhaps focusing more on Shrek getting back to his swamp and out of Far Far Away. The conflict from the previous movies was about finding true love and overcoming stereotypes, the second one did something similar with the parents and Fiona choosing the real Shrek over the ""new"" Shrek. Both of the prior films focused on topics that had more to do with an ugly ogre than a family ogre. This is reminiscent of the ""Ice Age"" films where the mammoth started a family over the course of the films and they gradually got worse and worse even though the animation effects were getting better and better. I feel the Arthur plot line could have been done better if they had fleshed it out more. In fact this film feels really fast certainly not as long or effective as the previous films. The villain was also somewhat of an odd choice, it really did not make much sense for the vapid Prince Charming to have the cunning or nerves to start a villain rebellion and take over the city. A better villain should have been Morgan La Faye or Mordred, two characters that would have fit better into the Arthurian mythos. I feel that maybe what could have been done instead of Shrek seeking out Arthur would have been for the young Arthur to instead seek out Shrek to slaughter as a way to prove himself worthy as king. Leave Far Far Away out of the picture and maybe even have the ""problems with Fiona"" subplot to not to be about potential fatherhood but instead getting back together in the end and overcoming petty differences. Really, they should have stopped at the second Shrek film where the characters were ""happily ever after"" and not much else could be done with them. I know that Shrek is a semi sarcastic adult take on fairy tales, but potential fatherhood is, well, not as big a draw as a sarcastic ogre finding love in a princess, which was a much better subversion of the traditional conception of standard fairy tales. This one was meh, and the fourth one was bleh.Quick note. This website doesn't allow brackets? Oh well..."
97,Shrek the Third,6,30 July 2016,Far far away... from the first two movie's level...,"In his review of ""Shrek 2"", Ebert made a very interesting remark, he said that he might have loved the film more if it was the first. By this logic, we can take it that popularity is inversely proportional to the position within the trilogy, with a few exceptions. In the case of ""Shrek"" franchise, it wouldn't do justice to the original movie to say that the third one plays on the same league, I'm not even sure it plays on the second's league either.Again, it's far from being a bad movie, but it seems like the zany creativity that inhabited the animators had been transferred to some newer and fresher projects. In the end, it's not difficult to point out what went wrong with ""Shrek the Third"", there were worrying signs already in the second film. ""Shrek 2"" was funny, original and featured the addition of Puss in Boots, but the main plot was very similar to the first, and the challenge of Shrek being accepted by his in-laws, wasn't the most exciting from a child's standpoint. Yet it worked because of the vital addition of new characters, especially Puss in Boots.In ""Shrek the Third"", you have the same characters; Charming replaces his mother in the villainous role so it's a good thing they didn't kill him off in the second one. Shrek and Fiona live in Far Far Away, happily we're tempted to say except that Fiona wants children and Shrek feels like he's not ready for it. Even TV dramas try to avoid these clichés like the plague but the writers thought this would make a good set-up. And it is a situation many people can relate too, but children? Shrek and Fiona act like a normal couple, too normal for the story's own good. But things start happening, a dying King Harold names Shrek as his only heir, but the ogre doesn't feel like King material (tell that to a frog), he learns that the only one who can sit on the throne, is Arthur. Yes, THE king Arthur. Why not after all, The start is a little slow but at that point, there's still some hope that we're heading toward an interesting quest, but despite all the film's efforts, each idea falls flat, at least by the first film's standards. Charming meets all the Fairy Tales villains in a tavern (Hook, the Queen etc.) and they form a sort of squad determine to take the ultimate revenge against their respective antagonists, fair enough, but too many villains make their characterization superficial and only foils for punctual gags. The same with the discovery of Arthur in a college, it starts well, but the way Shrek manages to convince the frail and insecure Arthur voiced by Justin Timberlake, feels rather anticlimactic.On its way home, the ship runs aground an Island where they meet Merlin and the Island sequence is the occasion for some heart-to-heart talk about responsibilities, Shrek realizes that Artie's reluctance to become a King reflects his own attitude toward fatherhood. As an adult, I found that part well-written although predictable, it's precisely because Shrek is such a fully developed character that I was drawn into it can't say I cared for Arthur. But the question is not whether I like it, but whether kids would. Themes of responsibility and self-questioning are relevant, but not when you go to see an ogre story set in a medieval fantasy world. To make it worse, even the fight sequence between the heroes and the villains has a feeling of déjà-vu. Show us something we don't see coming.And when our heroes use Merlin's magic to go back to Far Far Away, one side-effect consists on Donkey and Puss exchanging their bodies, and that's perhaps the only memorable use of the two sidekicks, but it's not saying much, because there's never a point where this reversal plays a pivotal role to the story, to distract the enemy or something else, it's just an excuse for one or two funny one-liners and that's all. The exchange bit (and its mildly amusing punch line) illustrates how imagination has slipped. In the end, there's no memorable line from either Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy, and Shrek isn't strong enough to carry the whole film, and certainly not Artie with his frail shoulders, and his capricious and inconsistent persona. We're Far Far Away from the level of the first film.There was one little bit that worked though, the subplot involving Fiona and the fairy tales heroines, immortalized by Disney: Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty to name the most instantly recognizable. I must say it was quite fun to see them talking and behaving like the real housewives of Beverly Hills before turning into Charlie's Angels, so for the first time, they wouldn't wait for any Prince or hero to save the day. But it's the same problem than the villain, too many characters. Basically, the film is overflowed by its creatures, even the little sidekicks Pinocchio, Wolf, the Three Pigs must join the show creating the most confusing feeling of chaos, weakening even more the climax that should have consisted on one confrontation, like in the first and to some extent, the second.But six years have passed between these films and many other DreamWorks films so my guess is that even the creators knew they weren't making a masterpiece. And it's very revealing that the DVD features don't even bother to show any interviews of the makers. So, maybe it's the kind fo movie to look at with forgiving eyes, and I wonder if the ending montage wasn't meant to a little self-parodying. As a recent father, I could totally relate to the milk preparations, the diaper changing (with growing dexterity) and especially the 'what next?' bit. But then, I was thinking what's next indeed? Shrek looking for a job? Midlife Crisis? An affair with Dragon?"
98,Shrek the Third,5,1 March 2016,Disappointing after the first movie,"I want to say good things about Shrek due to the first movie actually being good. The premise behind Shrek is that all characters in fairy tales have a place and they live up to it. Shrek is no exception, he is an ogre and is feared, but he chooses to do things as he pleases. Fast forward two movies and we're at the third.This time around a villain in dismay over his defeat and humiliation by Shrek, has now vowed revenge. He has gotten all of the villains in the area to help him take over ""Far Far Away"" and enact his revenge. Shrek in the meantime is tiring of standing in as the king, and seeks the next heir in line so that he may return to his own house in the woods. His wife is also pregnant to keep things interesting.The film has a lot of ups and downs. The first half of the movie is actually pretty good, but for some reason the latter half just seems to drag on. The movie is quite over the top in what it creates for the audience. But then again, Shrek has always been over the top and this is just continuing it. Perhaps the series is finally met with the conclusion that it needs, I didn't particularly get into this film. Shrek seems to be a bit of a secondary role here, Puss in Boots and Donkey seem to get more attention, and there are a number of supporting characters that get a lot of screen time, further taking away the movie's namesake.The film is not what I would call trite; but it does seem to indicate that its now or nothing due to the trilogy coming to a close. I do not recommend this film to others.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=10693)"
99,Shrek the Third,3,22 November 2015,"Unnecessary, Shrek the Third exists on links to its masterful predecessor and cannot break new ground","Shrek the Third is a bland, uninspired and unnecessary sequel to two masterpieces of animated storytelling. When the King of Far Far Away dies, Shrek and Fiona are set to inherit the Kingdom, but Shrek doesn't want to be King so they must set out to find the new heir, Arthur.While Shrek and his loyal sidekicks seek out Arthur, Fiona is dealing with the idea of motherhood. This is pretty much all Fiona does for the entire movie - the other fairy tale princesses rock up (including Amy Poehler is Snow White in a wasted role) before promptly being taken captive by Prince Charming. The secondary antagonist of the second film, Charming is a bit flat in the villain department because he's already run his course. Shrek the Third feels more like a third act to Shrek 2, with nothing particularly groundbreaking in its own right. There's a couple of Arthurian legend references, but they lack the fun and role reversal that made the first two Shreks so funny. Eddie Murphy as Donkey and Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots both get left on the sidelines as the film packs with too many unnecessary characters, not least of which is Arthur himself. Justin Timberlake's breathy Mark Wahlberg impression is grating on the ears, and the fact that he doesn't have any scenes with Fiona (Timberlake's real life ex-girlfriend Cameron Diaz) means we can't even laugh at it.The writing takes a huge hit in Shrek the Third. The first two films are incredibly witty with jokes that are subtle enough for adults to love but kids to innocently miss. A typical insult in this film is ""the only thing you're going to be king of is king of stupid!""Yeah.During the film's climax, Donkey, Puss and Fiona lead forces to save a captured Shrek on stage before everyone. The fact that Fiona rocks up just as Donkey and Puss do pretty much renders her entire plot pointless, as their escape has ultimately no impact on the story. The battle itself has none of the emotional stakes of Shrek 2, but rehashes the same antagonist and the same setting with many of the same heroes. However, unlike the satisfying conclusion of last time, this battle is saved by Artie who delivers a sappy and cliché ""Lets All Love One Another"" speech which has all the villains throw down their weapons.Then in the most excruciating moment possible, Charming stabs Shrek - only to miss and go under his arm. Then Dragon knocks Rapunzel's tower on him, presumably killing him instantly.That's messed up.Shrek the Third was wholly unnecessary. Its too tied to the second Shrek (the kingdom of Far Far Away and Charming's claim to its throne). Surprisingly I almost preferred the ending from Shrek 2 regarding Charming, where the Ugly Stepsister snaps him up for a dance. I can see the logic for bringing him back to resolve in another sequel, but the result is a film that has no ground to break on its own. Its a breezy 93 minutes, which contributes to its ""blink and you'll miss it"" vibe, because outside two flimsy stories no one has anything to do here."
100,Shrek the Third,,28 October 2008,Lacks the magic touch of the predecessors,"Don't get me wrong here  like hosts of Shrek fans, my anxiety levels were RDXed up for the another outing of Shrek. However I felt letdown. Technically the quality is superior to the previous Shrek's but seems like the efforts were concentrated on cramping as many animated characters possible into the movie. The earlier Shrek's rested heavily on the tongue-in-cheek lines which were spot-on, however this time they fall flat. Prince Charming was already an irritating character in earlier Shrek's, but in ""3"", he gets a major footage and hence irritates a lot more.Artie's character somehow fails to blend in. Hello the entire college episode is disjointed. Merlin is hopeless (was he based on Steven Spielberg btw?). Frog King episode .. cough! cough! cough! .. was long-winded! Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty  constipated humour and equally irritating as Prince Charming. BTW  all my good childhood memories are now gone awash!Only saving grace was Puss-in-boots and Donkey swap episode."
101,Shrek the Third,6,24 August 2008,Good romp for kids - but self-regarding cineastes avoid (as we avoid them),"Those IMDb users who have criticised Shrek The Third rather miss the point. There are two films here: one for children and one - if you like - for everyone else. The one for children, like the first two Shrek films, is a delight. Lots of laughs, lots of fighting, a bit of this and a bit of that. It's just what children enjoy. And if 'grown-ups' (as they are quaintly described, the term, misleadingly, implying that they have reached a degree of maturity) can get into the spirit of it, they, too, will enjoy this thoroughly. If, on the other hand, you really do want to insist on stepping back and pointing out various failings in the film, there are some we can mention. The story is very, very flimsy. Who is this Artie or Arthur, who is, apparently, next in line to the throne? What relation is he to the dying king? And exactly why is he a 'loser' if only to supply the necessary plot device of coming good in the end and, deus ex machina, to save Shrek from, well, death? Making him a loser also allows the film to deliver the, by now, obligatory, sermon on how 'everyone can be a winner/everyone is important/everyone can be themselves etc. (and, unfortunately, ad nauseam). Apropos this kind of Dick and Dora sermonising, there was a neat line in The Incredibles when one little boy's mother says 'he is special' because 'everyone is special'. To which the lad replies with impeccable, though under the circumstances, graceless logic: 'If everyone is special, that means no one is.' Quite. It doesn't really pay to examine Hollywood's cod sermonising too closely. But back to Shrek The Third. A great deal is made of how the gals are just as good as the guys - this is, after all, a 21st century film and acknowledging a feminist cliché or two is equally as obligatory. So we see the sisters in action as the king's widow and Fiona's mother knocks down a granite prison wall with her forehead, while the rest of the sisters then go on to demonstrate some very nifty, not to say cool, action man - sorry, action woman - moves. Well, that's all well and good, but feminism was apparently forced to take a back seat when the king died and Shrek is declared his heir. Sorry, but isn't Fiona his daughter and shouldn't she, as his direct descendant, inherit his crown? And speaking of queens, why couldn't the king's widow take over after the king's death and rule until she died? It seems that Hollywood likes to promote feminism but not too much. It might rock the boat. Finally, perhaps I missed something, but why is Prince Charming a baddie? What turned him into a baddie? We don't seem to have been informed. It can't be because his stage performance was booed, can it? Surely not. That would simply be too facile. So why is he a baddie? Well there you have three quibbles, three quite substantial holes which rather dent this particular exercise in film-making. But ask your children: do they care? Do they heck, they just cheer on the good guys and hiss the baddies (who all, in another of those excessively mawkish Hollywood twists, come good in the end. All together now: Aaaahh.) So take heart: if your sensibility can accept these utterly gross transgressions in the laws of good film-making, and if, on the other hand, you really do enjoy stunning animation, some good jokes and of you can suspend your undoubted maturity for 90 minutes and simply want an enjoyable film, Shrek The Third will not disappoint."
102,Shrek the Third,6,17 March 2008,slightly disappointing,"i was a huge fan of shrek 1 & 2, for they were both funny, heartwarming and visually stunning 3D animation masterpieces. Compared to the prior two, however, Shrek the third turned out slightly disappointing, and in every possible aspect. The story overall was not as intriguing or as funny as the previous two. It's not a bad story, but it fell flat comparing to the first two. And although it doesn't hurt the movie itself, the storyline is very predictable. There's not many surprises or even twists here. And the jokes seemed rather forced and clichéd and therefore not as funny as they intended to be. It seems that the people who made Shrek had finally run out of jokes and was trying too hard being funny. The visuals and the details are as stunning as usual, but you won't see much new technical enhancement or special effects that would make you go wow, which i believe is probably due to the fact that they have already achieved near perfection in the 3D animation of Shrek 2, so it's hard to make any technical breakthrough in this one. Almost all of the stunning effects you see in this movie has been used in the previous two, so not much to expect of the visual effects here. In general, as much as it may have tried, Shrek the third failed to live up to shrek 1 & 2. And it seems that there's something missing here but i can't quite put my finger on it. Shrek the third may not be as successful and enjoyable as Shrek 1 or 2, it's still a feel-good movie for everyone."
103,Shrek the Third,6,25 January 2008,Uninspired and less funny,"Following one of the laws of modern Hollywood, a successful movie gets a sequel. Unfortunately another law seems to forbid sequels which are able to hold a candle to its forerunners.""Shrek The Third"" lacks of creativity, it just repeats the jokes of the forerunners, still parodying the good ol' Disney Classics and Fairy Tales. It was funny in the first, it worked (to my mind)even better in Shrek 2, due to the new characters in it, but in the Third, little Artie is just unsympathetic and awkward, and the humor has a ""I-know-that-one-moment"". Additionally, the story is far-fetched.Nevertheless, the movie HAS some good points, e. g. I liked the voice acting especially of Idle and Cleese, and it has some good scenes, but there are just not as much as in the first two installments of the series.Well, but the movie was a success, so the 4th will sure be coming..."
104,Shrek the Third,5,25 December 2007,"Good movie. But, for third's, doesn't beat Spidey 3!","Pixar has been doing really well over the past several years. A Bugs Life: Good. Ant's: Horrible. Toy Story and Toy Story 2: Classics. The Incredibles: Flawless. Finding Nemo: One of my personal Pixar faves! Shrek the Third was hysterical!! The acting, um, Antonio Banderas never ceases to amaze me. Eddie Murphy never ceases to amaze me as well. Mike Myer's and Cameron Diaz were the same (nothing unique about there roles in this third one.) Julie Andrews, was awesome. John Cleese, although his part was short in this one, was amazing. Justin Timberlake, oh boy, um, he needs to stop acting and keep singing. He's NOT a good actor. He over did it. Storyline was executed really well. It was A LOT better than Ratatouille. But, um, concerning sequels this year: Shrek The Third, Pirates: At World's End, and Spider-Man 3. No sequel this year can top Spider-Man 3!! NO Sequel can top Spider-Man 3 this year!! ThAT is a flawless movie!!! Anyway, if you enjoyed the first two Shrek's, see this one, but, skip Ratatouille."
105,Shrek the Third,,9 December 2007,Remember when it was funny?,"I enjoyed Shrek and Shrek 2 for a simple reason: they made me laugh. I hated Shrek the Third (from now on S3) for an even simpler reason: I sat through it bored and stony-faced. I think I giggled three times during the whole movie, all in the first ten minutes.The series is now as trite as the tales it's supposed to be spoofing. It's basically a Disney movie - modern Disney, not classic one, which was great - only with the obligatory fart jokes (something which, contrary to what Hollywood believes, has never been funny) and a handful of pop references tossed in. The biggest offender is Artie (King Arthur of the myth), a corny ""troubled youngster who finds a father figure and accepts his responsibilities""; it's about as funny as it sounds.Series veterans Myers (Shrek), Murphy (Donkey) and Banderas (Puss in Boots) sound tired and collect their paychecks.There is a lot of slapstick and little parody; S3 follows the school of thought that if things happen fast, even without actual jokes, the result will be amusing. Sorry, folks, it doesn't work that way; humor benefits from speed, but requires intelligence as well.An interesting rule about movies in general and comedies in particular: if they have more than two-three people listed under ""writing credits"", it's usually a bad sign - the cinematic equivalent of being on a cruise ship where crew members start gathering on deck, whispering at each other and pointing at lifeboats. According to IMDb, S3 had THIRTEEN writers.3/10"
106,Shrek the Third,5,2 December 2007,Did the Writer Change?,"The first thing I did after watching this movie was enter IMDb.com and check if the writer has changed for ""Shrek the Third"". Surprisingly, it's the same story writer, which is a shame. Compared to ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"", ""Shrek the Third"" is very shallow, both on the story and on the humor. When ""Shrek"" had a sequel, I was suspicious that it might be hiding behind the fame of the first movie, but I was wrong. I had enjoyed ""Shrek 2"" more than the first movie. Even though the first movie pretty much ended in a happily ever after way, the story of the second movie was even better than the first one, and more exciting in my opinion. So I was expecting the third to be better than both 1 and 2, but it just looks like a bad imitation of Shrek movies made by another company.5 stars is only for the greatness of the animation. You can see how incredibly the technology of animation has evolved. But there's still no technology in the world which can make such a boring movie exciting. This is not just an animation movie, this is ""Shrek"", and it HAD to be funny and exciting. As I said before, there's no depth in the story. Not even logic. OK it may be an animation, it may be about fairy tales, it may be a comedy movie, but still it had to have some credibility and originality on the story for us to stick ourselves onto. The loser prince decides to take over the city, he enters the villain bar, convinces everyone to attack and terrorizes the whole city with a bar of bad guys, and even becomes a king. Also, the fairy tale spoofs were no better than before, if not weaker.Many people say a third movie is too much for Shrek, but I disagree. It could still be fun, even better than the old ones, because Shrek is a very open story which anything can be added to. But disappointingly, instead of thinking of a new story, the writer has stretched the story of Shrek 2 to a point of boredom and lameness. I mean, it could have been Prince Charming and the villains become good too and fight against a greater evil, for the sake of taking things to a new level, this evil could be from outside the fairy world altogether. Look I wrote a better story than the actual one in 5 minutes."
107,Shrek the Third,5,29 November 2007,Shrek the Third,"The first two films were packed with plenty of gags and wit for all the family, but I have to say this second sequel, you can tell they are struggling to keep it fresh, but it is still a fun film. Basically King Harold (John Cleese), now a toad, has fallen ill, and until he gets better Shrek (Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) have to take care of all his jobs, e.g. knighting people, launching ships and dressing like royals, all going disastrously wrong. Before the King dies he mentions the only other person besides Shrek suitable to run the kingdom, Arthur (Justin Timberlake), in Worcestershire. So while Shrek, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) set off to go and find him, a vengeful Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and many fairytale villains are storming the kingdom to get their happily ever after that was taken from them. In the end, all the villains are defeated and Charming seems to have been killed, Artie, having doubts earlier, does decide to become king, Puss and Donkey, having their bodies swapped, go back to normal, and Shrek and Fiona return to the swamp with three ogre triplets. Also starring Julie Andrews as Queen Lillian, Eric Idle as Merlin, Cody Cameron as Pinocchio and others, Larry King as Doris (Jonathan Ross replaced him in Shrek 2), Cheri Oteri as Belle, Maya Rudolph as Rapunzel, Amy Sedaris as Cinderella and Conrad Vernon as Gingerbread Man and others. The good jokes include the King that won't die (three times), the song ""Live and Let Die"" for the funeral, the baby nightmare (including the puking), and a great song at the end by Murphy and Banderas, ""Thank You (For Letting Me Be Myself)"". It may have the good voices and the still great computer wonderful animation, but it is not as good as the previous two, but still a fun animated fantasy comedy adventure. Worth watching!"
108,Shrek the Third,6,27 November 2007,Disappointing Sequel,"Shrek the Third (2007, Dir. Chris Miller) When the King of Far, Far Away 'croaks', it is up to Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots go off to bring back the next heir to the throne, Artie . Whilst Shrek and his crew are gone, Prince Charming brings together all evil fairy tale creatures in an attempt to take over as the new king.The problem of being so great like 'Shrek 2' was, there is the hard job of having another great sequel which comes after it. The problem here in this movie, is the lack of jokes compared to the first two movies. There just wasn't many parts of the movie, which would actually made you laugh out loud. The story was a good idea, but was wasted with the poor writing. The characters still have that wonderful charm with them. The new characters introduced aren't bad either. Eric Idle plays Merlin, who is one of the better characters in the Shrek series, and Justin Timberlake is actually a very good actor, and i was very impressed with him. Still, it is an enjoyable movie, which i am able to watch.""Can i interest anyone in a snack or beverage?"" - Merlin (Eric Idle)"
109,Shrek the Third,2,26 November 2007,Whatta Turkey!,"Gee, just in time for Thanksgiving, they release Shrek III. And what a coincidence, it's turkey time! There's a lot of bad films out there these days, and unfortunately Shrek III is one of them. The animation, as always, was good otherwise I would have rated it a 1, but everything else about this movie tanked.What were the creative minds thinking, or did they? I swear they got their plot devices from a field trip to Cal State Northridge. Only the students there would have been able to come up with something infinitely more clever.All the ""prithee"" talk might have worked if it wasn't jarringly juxtaposed with ""valley girlspeak"", which on the whole left me like totally disconnected with the movie.The studio ought to donate the proceeds to charity. They certainly didn't earn them!"
110,Shrek the Third,3,24 November 2007,Too Many Serious Messages For A Fun Movie,"I never give a movie three stars, but I am going to make an exception for this one. There were some funny scenes in this movie, like when the gingerbread man kept cracking jokes about the Prince's bad acting during the beginning of the movie. Shrek also cracked jokes about the Prince's bad acting. But there were too many sad heartbreaking messages in this movie. The frog king, who is Fiona's dad, died. Artie was picked on at school and depressed about how things were going in his life. And Shrek was feeling bad. He was not ready to be a father. There were even serious, not funny moments with the Donkey and Puss in Boots in this movie!"
111,Shrek the Third,6,24 November 2007,cute but lacking substance,"Some cute jokes and set ups, but definitely NOT the ""best Shrek yet"". I am beginning to think that the more a movie is hyped the more likely it is covering up for something missing. In this case the plot was a single strand with no twists or turns that ended up just the way you think it will; unlike One and Two where we were kept guessing with a surprise in the last 5 minutes of each movie. This movie climaxes with a ""believe in yourself"" speech that could have been copied from any kid's movie from the past 50 years. Donkey and Puss had no real role in the plot- just hanging out. In the previous 2 movies we saw Shrek and Fiona's relationship be tested and grow stronger- they barely talk to each other in this one. And all the clever little Fairy Tale innovations of Shrek's world that delighted us in One and Two- nothing new in Three at all. It was more like a formula Disney movie than a Mike Meyers creation. Oh well, still fun to watch. My 9 year old really liked it. But when I hit the DVD collection to watch a fave- it will be Shrek one or two- not the Third."
112,Shrek the Third,,20 November 2007,Stupid.,"Stupid.Seriously... Stupid. I'm sure that a massive amount of effort went into creating this movie and that the legions of kiddy fans all adored its lighthearted tom foolery, but it obviously relies on the novelty of the Shrek franchise more than anything else, just like the God awful Spiderman sequels.www.manwithavan.blogspot.comSeriously... Stupid. I'm sure that a massive amount of effort went into creating this movie and that the legions of kiddy fans all adored its lighthearted tom foolery, but it obviously relies on the novelty of the Shrek franchise more than anything else, just like the God awful Spiderman sequels."
113,Shrek the Third,3,17 November 2007,I was not expecting much and still I was disappointed,"To be honest, I give 7 out of 10 for the original Shrek and 10 out of 10 for Shrek 2. There was no way this third installment was going to be able to top the sequel. Uninspired storyline, marginally written new characters, even the established characters had little to do. What happened to the razor-sharp wit and clever inside jokes and visuals from Shrek 2? What about the wackiness? Gone, gone, gone. What was left? Not much, I'm afraid. The storyline was flat. Nothing was fleshed out. There was no flow to the story or the action. I felt as if I'd just seen a handful of snippets that were not good enough to make it into the real movie and had been left on the cutting room floor. If they'd stopped at Shrek 2, we'd all have lived happily ever after."
114,Shrek the Third,5,15 November 2007,"The third time is not a charm,  This was not funny at all.","Shrek 1 & Shrek 2 were both thoroughly enjoyable.I had expected this one to be enjoyable as well.I WAS VASTLY DISAPPOINTED..In fact I did not even laugh or feel any enjoyment watching this movie. It was not funny at all.There were too many fairy tale characters here, many of whom I vastly enjoyed years ago, They did nothing here but waste my time.The song score was pitiful, as you only heard next to no lyrics.. Many talented actors lent there voices for the various characters,BUT I did not know who was doing who until the credits at the end of film..The so-called script made insulting fun of beloved fairy tale characters. We have Snow White WITHOUT THE DRWARFS, for example.The legend of King Arthur was unfairly spoofed, especially since Julie Andrews (CAMELOT) was one of the voices..Technically the animation was great,If they make part I do hope it is better than this .RATINGS ** (out of 4) 55 points (out of 60) IMDb 5 (out of 10)"
115,Shrek the Third,4,1 November 2007,One of three below-par summer sequels in 2007,"It's a bad start when I went out to see Shrek The Third partly because I knew it would be short. Despite this, there were still a couple of moments where I was bored, but they had been left in to make 90+ minutes. STT is more of a proper kids' film in the style it wants to parody (ie, Disney) but that means that it loses the anarchic touches of the first two films. Compared to Spider Man 3 and Pirates 3 though, it drops the least amount of quality for being the third. It parodies and rips shots from Rosemary's Baby, Jurassic Park, The first Lord of the Rings Movie and, depending on how you like your trees, The Evil Dead OR the second Lord of The Rings film. This time, the homages couldn't save it, and had I not been waiting to watch Live Free or Die Hard, I wouldn't have killed time to watch it.There's going to be the Solo Puss movie eventually and maybe that spin-off will help because this was just a cash-in."
116,Shrek the Third,3,1 November 2007,"Shrek has been ""milked"".","A repeat of the first film (Shrek goes to pick up someone who doesn't want to go with him, and delivers that person to someone else) - Gag after gag with no real storyline.The gags aren't that funny.Any good jokes were put on the trailers, which were shown to you about fifty times on TV and such, making them unfunny when you see the whole film.Pointless use of characters (some characters did not need to be involved, such as the princesses).You are waiting for the good bits to come on, but they never come.Why has all this happened? Because Shrek has been ""milked"" (and will continue to be ""milked"" as Shrek 4 and a Puss in Boots spin off are currently in production). Hollywood loves sequels, but this has pushed it too far.Worth seeing if you are a fan of the Shrek series, but you will be disappointed.5/10"
117,Shrek the Third,7,27 October 2007,It's not easy being green ...,"The first movie ever produced by Dreamworks, was the great action movie ""The peacemaker"" with George Clooney and Nicole Kidman. The first animation pictures by Dreamworks were ""The prince of Egypt"" and ""The road to El Dorado"". The truth however is that it was the 2001-blockbuster ""Shrek"" that put Dreamworks on the map. It was a fabulous animation picture and one of the funniest ever made. The sequel had less jokes than the first one, but it turned out to be the ultimate feel-good movie and thus it was a fantastic movie altogether. Many wondered how far they could go with this franchise. As it turned out, there will be a fourth Shrek-movie in the near future and there's even a spin-off planned for one of its characters namely the Spanish Zorro-cat Puss in Boots. Needless to say: this franchise is doing extremely well. Even so: the third Shrek-film is by far the weakest one yet and this let-down is a bit unexpected.""Shrek the Third"" is by no means a bad movie. It's in fact the opposite. It's a good movie. The special effects of this film are absolutely stunning! They are better than those of the previous Shrek-movies. Now each and every character has its own unique clothing and they all have a very different kind of haircut too. There's more use of color and a much wider variety of facial expressions of each character. The amount of people in a single frame has also increased exponentially. The frequent use of daylight (or any other kind of light such as torches) and darkness are far more impressive and they also open up a whole new world for creating realistic shadows. New world are introduced as well and they all appear vastly superior. And we even get to see real magic by Merlin; the greatest wizard of all who can shoot light beams from his hands.So visually, the Shrek-movies have only improved. Then what's with that slight feel of disappointment if everything seems so beautiful? Well, the problem is that they obviously were more focused on the looks than on the contents of this animation film. ""Shrek the Third"" is always quite amusing to watch and never any boring, but there simply aren't too many funny jokes to be had. Whilst the first film was literally crammed with hilarious moments, the third one will probably produce a few smiles on your face and an occasional laugh ... but that's about it! The overuse of long-winded monologues and conversations are the main reason as to why the third Shrek-film is no match for its previous installments. Then again: the newborn triplets of Shrek are without a doubt the cutest thing ever created in the history of animation. They look like real babies and all three of them are exceptionally adorable. Pity that we only saw so little of them in this movie. But I have a strong feeling that they will play an important part in the next one for sure.The cast of ""Shrek the Third"" is only growing with each new chapter. By now: Mike Myers is playing on automatic pilot and the same could be said for Cameron Diaz and Eddy Murphy. They are all still quite funny but they add nothing new really. Antonio Banderas should also be categorized as such, but somehow I found his character a lot more amusing than the ones above. The same goes for Rupert Everett who stars again as Prince Charming. This character is also a joy to watch. A lot less funny but still okay are two new characters. The wizard Merlin makes a short yet rather comical appearance and is wonderfully voiced by British actor Eric Idle who's probably best known as a member of Monty Python. American singer/songwriter Justin Timberlake does the voice of Artie - the soon-to-be king of Far far away. This character is neither interesting nor funny, and that's a real pity.Many fairy tale creatures return such as Pinocchio, the three pigs and of course the Gingerbread man. New ones are added such as Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping beauty. The constant quarrel between the ladies does provide a couple of good jokes. But unfortunately: not all jokes work out well. And this is not how things used to be in the world of Shrek. Perhaps the fourth movie will find a perfect balance again between awesome computer graphics and an endless diversity of funny jokes.In short: ""Shrek the Third"" is not only the third in number, but also in quality. It's a good animation movie but the cracks are clearly beginning to show. If the next movie isn't hilarious like Shrek 1 or refreshing like Shrek 2, they ought to pull the plug."
118,Shrek the Third,3,15 October 2007,what a waste of time!!!,The movie's story failed to surprise us as we expected it to do so. Apart from the celebrities behind the characters Shrek the third didn't do much as a main character and the whole movie was just a franchise - part 3 - lets attract people - to sell tickets. One very disturbing scene was when the Prince Charming was practicing for his stage play and he was killing a character dressed as animal with his sword. He did that two times. Sorry folks but how do u explain that to a young kid??? The movie failed to surprise us and it turned out to be very boring at the end. No great surprises no great plots just a very simple storyboard. Would not recommend it.
119,Shrek the Third,4,13 October 2007,Shrek the Turd is plain awful,"Shrek the Turd resembles a bit with Happily never after, in trying to re-write the classic fairy tales. But boy, does it get everything wrong.It's much more ""family""-oriented and has almost no jokes. Also, in standard Hollywood style, they mix every possible story that was ever written.Did you ever saw a Xena episode for example ? Well, Xena was alive when Jesus lived, also fought the Mount Olympus gods and probably there's an episode with Xena and Alien versus Predator. It's one ugly kitchen sink.And this is what Shrek the Turd is. A kitchen sink of whatever they could think of, with almost nothing funny.The animation is rather good, but what's the point of having something look realistic (like prince charming) or interesting (special effects) if you can't laugh."
120,Shrek the Third,9,11 October 2007,Better than I expected,"Simply put : Better than I expected. After reading some other comments and some critics, I wasn't expecting much out of Shrek the Third. So I must say I was impressed. The original Shrek ""fun"" is still there, many gags, spoofs, all enjoyable. It obviously helps a lot to have seen the previous two movies, but I don't think it's a requirement. The animation is absolutely amazing, so well done that it goes unnoticed after a while... and lets you keep your focus on the story, the characters, quite a good thing! I didn't find any dull moments, the whole movie just zooms by. Don't expect much brain solicitation, but do get ready to keep smiling for a few hours after the film is finished."
121,Shrek the Third,5,23 September 2007,"Watchable, but I couldn't help being disappointed.","My Take: The weakest of the successful SHREK series. A few laughs though.After seeing art in the first two ""Shrek"" films, we would have expected more from ""Shrek the Third"". Although most of the laughs work, the creators make a mistake thinking it'll save the story. The story, basically, is almost nonexistent. It runs in a short 92 minutes, much too short, with not much happening with as much joy as those in previous SHREK films, partly due to the emptiness of its story. Still, there are enough well-executed comedy bits and I must say our Ogre still has the charm. The story has Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) destined to take over the kingdom of Far, Far Away, after the king (voiced briefly by John Cleese) passed away. Shrek, who thinks he's unworthy to take the king's position, instead searches for Arthur, who happens to be Princess Fiona's (voiced by Cameron Diaz) cousin. He finds Arthur (voiced by Justin Timberlake) in a Medieval College, being a total wimp. This is not the picture of a ruler, right? But no time for that, Prince Charming (voiced by Rupert Everett) demands a Royal treatment (a term here which I mean ""he wants to be king""). So of course, we get Shrek and his gang to the rescue and all that jazz. This leads to a couple of fun bits (including princesses that would put Lara Croft aside), but none quite as joyfully executed as those in its predecessors.As far as sequels go, disappointments are bound to come. I enjoyed the first ""Shrek"" film, it can easily pass as a modern instant classic, and the second one, ""Shrek 2"", is indeed a modern classic and their's no doubt about it, but ""Shrek the Third"" just makes you laugh, good enough, but I think we need more than ""good enough"". Instead of a lot of writers who know how to make people laugh, the directors (two of them, actually) could have at least hired ones that write a good story. The characters in this film are not given enough depth or interest, not unlike those in the those in previous SHREK films, so filled with zest and energy, as well as soft bits and adult-related personalities. The conclusion, which might be the weakest link of the film, is easily rushed. Still, If you liked the first two films then there is no stopping you from watching this one. Shrek and the gang, although unoriginal, still provide a bunch of smiles, and I did laugh a lot in this picture. Watch out for that ROSEMARY'S BABY-inspired nightmare! I'm ending this fairy tale of a film review by saying that I did like this entry. It was funny but lacks the creativity of the first two. With so much characters in this film, I would have expected them to have more life than a bunch of comedy bar-inspired figures molded to fairytale characters. SHREK THE THIRD is a much better view on video. It's worth buying and, with expectations that it would fall short of its predecessors, it does offer a few good laughs. Rating: **1/2 out of 5."
122,Shrek the Third,6,18 September 2007,Just Like Spider-Man 3 Shrek the Third Disappoints,"And what else is to expect from a third installment of the all-too familiar story which in this case brings nothing new and exciting to the plot, but rather plays on the popularity and the edge of the first original release? A little originality- Humor? Effort to make something similarly funny and memorable as the first or even the second one? I guess it was too much to expect.The first Shrek was awesome! All the characters had enough development time and we got to know their silliness and goofiness (the 3 piggies, gingerbread man, donkey and the puss)- but this time not only did these usual characters have limited (and rather blaah performance) we didn't get to see any new funny characters. Arthy (described as rebellious but seems more as a whimpy/skinny teenager) was as lame of a character as the eccentric poor ol' Merlin- not one funny line from either of them :( And the plot? When the King dies Shrek needs to take over the Kingdom but he doesn't feel fit- so he goes to search for Prince Arthur who is the second in line to the throne and convince him to take over the crown. In the meantime with the help of all rejected fairy tale characters Prince Charming decides to take over the Kingdom one last time (and succeeds). Shrek is back just in time and- yes you guessed it, restores the peace to the Kingdom. The End. Makes me wonder if the writers even put any effort into Shrek III or just pulled the screenplay out of their ass- probably the latter. After all, why bother when parents will still bring their children to see it based on the popularity and the warm fuzzy memories of the Shrek I. It's just sad that they clearly don't care to make a quality movie but rather money (surprise surprise)."
123,Shrek the Third,8,16 September 2007,Shrek the King,"Some of the critics were less appreciative of 'Shrek the Third' than it's two predecessors, but there's still plenty to enjoy, notably the rich sequence of jokes bound together by a reasonably coherent plot (based, as before, on the world of fairy-tales). And while the Shrek movies are not the most mordant of modern animated cartoons, the film explores, albeit in comic vein, the question of what makes us act the way we do and does not divide its characters into absolute categories of black-and-white (with the exception of the only true villain, who, entertainingly, is Prince Charming!). It should also be noted quite how high the standard of computer animation is, which allows mood and humour to be conveyed through the use of relatively subtle body language; most remarkable is the character of Puss-in-Boots, whose moves are a perfect combination of feline and human. It's not (for an adult, at least), a life-changing movie; but it is great fun."
124,Shrek the Third,,10 September 2007,The best of the 3 Shreks,"For some reason, the previous two Shreks did not appeal to me. However, I find this one a lot better than the previous two, and I actually secretly chide myself for liking Shrek 3.The animation of the film is as good as usual. The various characters are given similar story time, and the cat is featured quite prominently, which I suspect is to prepare for a spin off. The fact that the donkey gets a lot less lines in this film is a bonus, because I have always found him very annoying. The story is simple in the film, but it brings out a lot of positive messages such as friendship, mutual support, and that anyone can achieve if they try. My conclusion is that it is a watchable film!"
125,Shrek the Third,6,9 September 2007,"Not horrible, but worst out of the 3","Hollywood cannot rest a good idea....From a good horror movie, to kids movies, they cannot let anything rest. Shrek is one of those movies I wished they would have left alone. They went from letting a very touching, entertaining movie to making a third installment full of somewhat innuendos and adult jokes when it's supposed to be a kids movie.In my opinion, this was just a money making scheme. The film wasn't that bad, but it was one of those that you think, ""Hey this movie didn't change my life, so I can live without it."" The fact now, that little Shreks came about, shows another will be in the makes, so more money for Hollywood.At least Hollywood didn't kill Ice Age.....yet."
126,Shrek the Third,3,8 September 2007,Boring...,"Well i was anticipating Shrek the Third because i love the second and first one. I heard it was really good so i went to the theater to go see it. Boy was i disappointed!!!! This movie was awful. It had the most played out pop culture references( The immigration song? give me a break), A huge cliché( a lovable loser is the heir to a kingdom,that is at least the 29th time i have seen that). It also felt like is was missing something. all shriek the third was a plot reject for the first one and second. The only reason I gave the movie a 3 instead of a one because Eddie Murphy was in it. Please take my advice..........don't see Shrek the Third"
127,Shrek the Third,5,26 August 2007,One Too Many Shreks,"It's too bad studios don't know when to quit when they're ahead-- and I'd be willing to bet that there's a Shrek 4 on the horizon. Mark your calendar to remind yourself not to go. This one was just too much... to much pushing to find the jokes; too many predictable jokes; having Merlin as an old hippie and as the deus ex machina to magically send them back to Far Far Away was way too much. The princesses were predictable and not funny. The baby Shreks were disturbingly ugly, sort of baby-Bobby-Hills and not in a good way. The baby donkey/dragons were cute, but there wasn't enough of the donkey-dragon relationship which probably would have helped the movie, even if it didn't have much to do with the story. There were so many ""3 movies"" this summer, it was hard to know which to avoid, but Shrek was definitely one of them. Not worth the price of the ticket, but if you have to see it, wait until you can rent the DVD."
128,Shrek the Third,4,24 August 2007,Third time lucky? no,It was obvious after shrek 2 there would be a third. And i first heard of shrek 3 in 2005 that it was coming out in 2007.Well it's 2007 and have finally saw the most anticipated animated feature of the year.......and what do i think? in a word crap.The basic story is the king of far far away has died and shrek and Fiona are next in line to be the new king and queen. But shrek doesn't really fancy that idea so goes to get the next heir arthur. (or artie voiced by Justin Timberlake) Meanwhile prince charming is plotting to rule far far away and Fiona is pregnant.Here are the good points: The animation-The animation has come on leaps and bounds from the original shrek and facial expressions and effects on mud and water are exceptional.Eric Idle-Eric Idle plays merlin the wizard in this and this was a stroke if pure genius. All his scenes are funny and make you go into stitches.And here are the bad points: Justin Timberlake!- Until i saw shrek three i never knew that someone could be bad at voice acting. Justin Timberlake is terrible at voice acting! How! Well i can't honestly explain it but you have to see it for yourself to see how bad it is.Length-The story had a lot more potential to be longer therefor getting more in it but it finishes at one hour and twenty two minutes.Pace-It felt very VERY rushed. they basically made shrek three for the sake of making it. And because if this it was rushed and was over way too quick not packing not a great deal into it's short time span.Well thats my verdict.
129,Shrek the Third,7,22 July 2007,"Not as good as the first two,  agreed.  But still funny and incredibly cute!","I loved the first two Shrek films. My family and I are still quoting lines from those films. The first Shrek is a classic and how can you not love Eddie Murphy as Donkey? And I loved the introduction of Puss 'N' Boots from the second film. Antonio Banderas voiced that character deftly. So I was anxious to see the third film, Shrek the Third. Especially hearing that Shrek and Fiona were having a baby. And the trailers for this film made it look like a total laugh-fest. Well, it definitely was a laugh-fest. My parents and my sisters and I were howling in that packed theater. I know I laughed so hard at times my eyes were tearing up. I know one scene that made me laugh was when Fiona was trying to tell Shrek she was pregnant and the horn kept blowing on the ship. I thought that was cute. All the actors did well. Mike Myers is always brilliant as Shrek, as is Cameron Diaz as Fiona and Eddie Murphy as Donkey. But I thought Justin Timberlake as Artie was really the breakthrough performance. Yes, he did talk a lot but he played the irresponsible young ""prince"" well and he made you feel sympathy for him in all the confusion that was going on. And I loved the characters of Snow White and Cinderella, especially the scene where they were exacting their revenge on Prince Charming. That was hilarious. And the baby nightmare scene was a laugh out loud scene too. And OMG, how cute were those baby Ogres? They were adorable! I want one! Just kidding. And then the baby Donkey/Dragons were so funny looking but they were also adorable. Hard to believe Donkey was a daddy. LOL.Anyway the only thing, I think, that made this film not as good as the first two was that it seemed to drag on and on in the last hour or so. Just when you think they were done defeating Prince Charming and putting him in his place he would run away and they would be chasing him again. We just wanted to see Shrek and Fiona have their baby already!! But overall this film wasn't a total disappointment and I really enjoyed it. Of course I pretty much love any film that makes me laugh hysterically. Now, I will admit that this was a little too adult for the young children. Some of the jokes were very adult-oriented and even I couldn't believe they would use them in a children's movie but thank goodness SOME children don't get that kind of humor. But I know the little boy who was sitting next to me in the theater thoroughly enjoyed it. The Shrek films are a great franchise and I think they should make more. I love Shrek! Thank you for reading my review!"
130,Shrek the Third,6,17 July 2007,Shrek for adults.....NOT for children!,"Spoilers!!! I love the first two films, I could watch them every week and not get tired! My now six year old son has loved them since he was two and can quote huge chunks out of them, so we were really excited to finally see one at the cinema! But half way through he was bored, and asked when we could go home! If I had gone by myself I would have been perfectly happy! It is a great film, the graphics are amazing! The scene of the funeral was amazing and the jokes are really funny! But this is NOT a kids movie! Some of the scenes are too much for a kid to take in! Shreks dream, the frog dying then coming back to life, then dying all over again just left him confused. All the stuff about Shrek not wanting to be a dad went on for FAR too long for a child to handle! Most of the jokes an under 10 year old would not get! Puss' accent was lost on him most of the time, he kept asking what he had said. All in all, I would recommend this for ANY adult or teen, but leave your younger children at home with the first two!"
131,Shrek the Third,6,11 July 2007,The ogre rides again,"For the third time we have the pleasant company of the ogre, the princess Fiona and friends such as the Donkey and Puss in Boots. The visual part has the same excellent quality of the first two movies, the cartoons and the puppets are great indeed mainly in their very expressive look and the scenes of landscapes, towns and palace interiors are gorgeous. The animation is also very good. Only the story is somewhat weaker than in the two previous versions being a little less interesting maybe because of the ""déjà vu"" effect which makes it a little short of originality. But the main idea behind this story is the same of the other two: that ugly can be beautiful and doesn't need to go always with evil."
132,Shrek the Third,6,5 July 2007,funny but the worst of the 3,"The king is old and ill and Shrek must become the new King, as he doesn't want to, he must go to Worchestershire High school to find Artie, the next candidate. While he is away, Charming prince will take the power in order to be the King. Well the movie is at any moment boring and the 90 minutes it longs pass in a moment, but anyway, it has lost that fresh air it had, it is funny, but not so original. I smiled and laughed most of the time, but the incredible jokes that make you start to cry due to laughs have been lost. However, it is still funny. Now a problem is that there is a lot of characters and it is difficult to follow and recognize everybody (Who is RumpleStilking?) and it makes things sometimes a little confusing, but the plot is easy to follow as now the parodied things are Disney's films (sometimes cruelly). The technical part is superb, though, I cannot remember such a great number of bodies in the screen and all different and acting in such a natural way, in these part, only ""Cars"" is at its high; on the other hand, the fact that it is not so good film as the others makes the result a little disappointing, bit it is still good anyway."
133,Shrek the Third,6,4 July 2007,What a shame,"My family were expecting so much from this film when we went to the cinema and I guess it was always going to be a disappointment. As a lot of other comments have said, the first two movies were so good and this one has quite simply lost it's was a little.The story was nothing special and the jokes felt very tired. My husband and I did not think much of it however our niece really seemed to like it (she is 7). So I guess the people in Hollywood know that people will go and see this type of film whatever so do not worry too much about the script.It is still worth a visit to the cinema if you have not seen it but overall I hope they do not try to make a fourth version. That clearly would be starting to take the mickey!!!"
134,Shrek the Third,5,3 July 2007,Where is Shrek?,"The first ""Shrek"" came out of nowhere, an offbeat fractured fairy tale with a story suitable for kids and jokes aimed at adults. ""Shrek 2"" contained more of the same, particularly the latter, with an emphasis on MORE. The story was cruder, with images and humor that I wouldn't want my kids to see, and overbearingly bloated with gags, as the writers stuffed aural and visual pop culture references in like Mark Mangino at a buffet. Watching the sequel felt like being bludgeoned with a comic hammer that screamed Look what we can do! That progression leads to ""Shrek the Third"", batting second in the summer of the sequel, featuring an underwhelming trailer that threatened to continue the slide of the series.Not unexpectedly, this is the worst of the three, but the reasons for its limited appeal are surprising. The creators heeded the complaints about ""Shrek 2"" containing too many pseudo-clever jokes, which is good. Specific allusions like ""Mission: Impossible"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" have been largely replaced by general parodies of events like high school life and Broadway musicals. This alteration in humor is welcome but too severe, stripping the franchise of its definitive irreverent nature, which is bad. ""Shrek 3"" swings the comedy pendulum from the in-your-face extreme of the second past the moderation of the first to a unpleasantly safe converse. It frequently feels more like a less saccharine Disney movie than a Shrek movie, complete with a schmaltzy moral at the end.That's not to say that the movie isn't funny. The writing occasionally crackles; excellent comic timing is pervasive; and the sundry offbeat appearances of noteworthy characters like Captain Hook and Snow White are still entertaining. But on the whole everything feels restrained, like a kid who was reprimanded for doing something wrong and is now afraid to do much of anything. As much as I didn't like all of the prequels' base humor, this one needs more of it. The less flamboyant nature of the movie also diminishes its appeal to children, as does the metamorphosis of Shrek himself from rambunctious troublemaker to calmer father figure, a transformation that makes him more accessible to adults than kids.In the end, the movie ends up feeling much like the main character. Just as Shrek himself feels that the confinements of the crown prevent him from being himself, the movie feels muzzled, neutered by knee-jerk reactions to the second movie. It isn't gratingly bad, but neither is it actively good. ""Shrek the Third"" (good title, by the way) merely idles its way through a rightfully short eighty-seven minutes.Bottom Line: Third verse, different from the first (and second). Not quite the same, and notably worse. 5 of 10."
135,Shrek the Third,4,2 July 2007,Another Example Of How Third Times Are Unlucky,"Everything that could've went wrong with this chapter of Shrek, DID. The plot had great potential but fell flat on its face with the same dialogue, poor jokes and Justin Timberlake. Plot: Shrek and Fiona are next in line for the throne of Far Far Away but Shrek doesn't want it so goes to fetch Fiona's cousin Artie (Prince Arthur), whilst at the same time Prince Charming throws a hissy fit, rounds up Disney's bad guys and plans to stand in Shrek's way...again. The fact is the characters aren't lovable anymore. The third film lacks the heart that the first two had. The same thing happened with Ice Age 2. I got about 7 laughs out of a 90 minute film, that's very poor.Justin Timberlake's voice is nauseating in both movies and music. It's strange he had one of the lead roles in the same film the woman he was sleeping with at the time just happened to be starring in. Mike Myre's voice work determines a new character, whilst Timberlake's voice is distracting and irritating. He still sounds like he's 12 years old at age 26.Shrek is okay at best given the action sequences and beautiful animation, but it offers up nothing new. 75% of this film is dry and humourless and loses so much appeal, heart and character that the first two films offered.What would I like to be changed? Sack Justin Timberlake and rewrite the entire film, or just forget about it all together.However the kiddies will enjoy it."
136,Shrek the Third,5,1 July 2007,"Unfortunately, it WAS what i was expecting!","Right well i'll start with the good points! Firstly, this was a good length film because it wasn't too long- many of the other big films out so far this year just went on too long and i was getting bored because of it! Also, the film looks great as with all of the Shrek films, this is definitely no disappointment in that area! However, now we get on to where the problems start! Even though it does look great and they obviously spent a lot of time and money on that, the didn't spent much time on the storyline because its awful! I was just bored and almost felt bad because i love the Shrek films and desperately wanted to like this one even after hearing many bad reviews! But... i cant say i did! I only laughed once and now i cant even remember why which is obviously not great! The jokes weren't funny and the only bits that were amusing they had milked dry in the various trailers so they weren't remotely funny when i actually saw the film! One big problem for me was that it was missing one important character who made Shrek 2 so good for me... the Fairy Godmother, played by Jennifer Saunders! I know she died or whatever but without her it was completely bland! The evil villains were no where near as good as i thought they would, Prince Artie played by Justin Timberlake made no impact on me at all and most people in there were confused at who Timberlake played when they saw his name come up on the credits even with all the media hype about him and the film! Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz were fine as usual, there just weren't the laughs there! Even Donkey and Puss In Boots couldn't save the day and draw many laughs, which i think was due to them not having a very good role in the story! The princesses were amusing at times but that wore off after a while of the same type of jokes! The fairytale characters like Gingi and Pinocchio were quite amusing at times but, again, they should have been used more! My final word on the characters is that the school kids were extremely annoying especially the ""supposedly funny' cool young talk they had going on! Anyway, Shrek the Third really was such a disappointment and i wouldn't go and see it again however much i wish i wanted to! I mean there were obviously quite a lot of kids in the cinema but they were all completely bored and however annoying it was, i don't blame them! After the success of Shrek 2 they had already decided to announce the making of Shrek 4 even without having released Shrek the Third, but now to be honest i'm not much looking forward to Shrek 4 because now i'm just expecting them to rush out a quick film without really caring about how good it actually is! My advice would be to bring back the Fairy Godmother as she really was the star! Despite what i'm expecting of it, i REALLY hope to be proved wrong!"
137,Shrek the Third,6,30 June 2007,Thumbs up if you've got kids and it is a rainy day,"You have to love the animation - seemingly more real than real - and parents at least will enjoy the digs at cartoon and movie characters. This is even more a family film than 1 & 2, and is engineered to be that way. After the gentle if protracted passing on of the frog king, Shrek must find, bring back and somehow convince the second-in-line 'loser' Artie to be the new King, otherwise he ends up with the job. Meanwhile Prince Charming has his eye on the prize. Babies and incipient parenthood are liberally layered over the plot. All very wholesome at heart (nursery stories will be undermined of course), everyone's got a place in the world, the plot turns twice on speeches rather than violence, plus a LOT about babies. The donkey-dragon offspring made me smile, cavorting around as baby donkeys with wings and fire breath. Downside is that Shrek 3 is a bit ""fuzzy"" in the humour compared with 1 or 2, not as sharp. Verdict: take the kids, for the adults you know what to expect. Hope that helps."
138,Shrek the Third,5,30 June 2007,"Not bad, but going downhill","I thought the first Shrek movie was brilliant, I thought the second was pretty good. I think the third is....OK.This time round the King of Far Far Away dies and tells SHrek he's next in line for the throne. Shrek is more than a little dubious of this as all he wants to do is take Fiona back to his swamp. The King tells him the only other heir is Arthur, so Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots all go to his High School to get him and bring him back to be King. Meanwhile Prince Charming is bitter at not getting his Happily Ever After so he gathers all the bad guys from fairy tales to seize the castle and crown himself King and with Shrek away Fiona has to fight with her mother, Cinderella, Snow White and Beauty (who i thought was from Beauty and the Beast even though she kept falling asleep, it still took me forever to work out it was Sleeping Beauty!! duh) Somewhere along the way Shrek and co meets Merlin who transports them back to Far Far Away after the get shipwrecked, but he also switches Donkey and Puss' bodies round. Watching Donkey trying the doe eyed look is certainly something, as seen in the trailer.I was giggling most of the way through because there were lots of little funny bits all the way through, such as the aforementioned doe eyed looked and Eric Idle as a slightly eccentric Merlin was somehow the perfect pairing but it's just not as good as the other two.There is even less plot than the other two, although it doesn't really need much of a plot but all the jokes kind of felt repetitive. We've already seen the Shrek can't fit in because he's an ogre jokes. We've seen the Donkey being dumb stuff. The emphasis isn't on the old clichés quite as much, simply because they've done them all. The jokes are mainly visual now rather than the characters saying funny things. Mike Myers still has one of the best Scottish accents I've heard and I don't think Eddie Murphy is really suited to anything OTHER than Donkey any more because whenever I see him in anything recently all I can think is ""Donkey"" because he's so over the top. When I heard Justin Timberlake was in this I thought ""Oh crap!"" but his character is pretty good and he does well. Fiona isn't really anything new and quite frankly I don't think she was really used as much as she could have been (all she really did was tell the princesses they'd need to fight and grimace when Shrek made a mistake), but then again there's not much you could do with her, it's a three man show with Shrek, Donkey and Puss now.It's a family movie so young kids could go see it but there should be enough to keep older kids and adults amused too. All in all it was enjoyable, I giggled most of the way through and laughed a few times but I hope there isn't a fourth one, three is more than enough."
139,Shrek the Third,5,29 June 2007,funny in places... dull in others.,"This third Shrek movie, finds the character on a quest (with Donkey and Puss of course) to bring home the nephew of the late frog-king, to be the new king of Far, Far Away Land. Meanwhile, Prince Charming is plotting a take-over with the help of some fairy-tale villains, and it's up to Fiona and the fairy-tale princesses to try and stop him....and at the same time, Shrek has found out he's about to become a father....The first Shrek movie was very funny. The second had some great moments, but also benefited from the addition new characters into the mix. This time however, the movie suffers as the new characters don't really add anything to story. Justin Timberlake as Artie, the boy to be king, just lacks conviction in his voice performance. Eric Idle does get a bit of humour out of his eccentric wizard character. But the other new characters don't really register. However the regulars from 1 and 2 do well, but special mention to John Cleese for his dying king scene. It's one of the funniest moments of the movie.The jokes too aren't as funny. Whereas the first 2 had moments both children and adults could laugh at, this feels like it's more aimed towards adults in regards the sub-plot of Fiona and Shrek becoming parents. This may end up boring to some children, and with the exception of some funny bits at the start I don't think there is enough in the rest of the movie to interest them.Having said that, there are some good moments contained here. The scene of the Gingerbread Man's life flashing before his eyes is imaginative, and the scene of Pinocchio trying to answer the questions of Prince Charming while trying not to tell a lie is amusing.But for me the main problem of the movie is that the character of Shrek feels sidelined at times. Even during the climax of the movie I feel he's not being involved enough, but then I did think the ending a little bit too sentimental.But maybe I'm too harsh.In a summer of sequels (or three-quels!) It's not the worst. Sadly though that's not much of a recommendation."
140,Shrek the Third,6,28 June 2007,The Bubble bursts ...,"If I hadn't seen the first two movies I would have loved this. Problem is I have seen them, and I still enjoy getting pulled in by the plot, the characters, the gags, the effects when I seem them. So my expectations were high for part 3.I'm afraid the spell was broken quite quickly ... part 3 is light on plot, on innovation, on gags, on, well, just about everything except characters. I kept waiting for it to catch light, but it never really did. I was quite bored after 20 minutes - same old gags, same old sets - how many scenes from Shrek 1 & 2 were reused? I got fed up counting. The good gags were few and far between.And the cast, well, it seems they've just scooped up the entire cast from parts 1 and 2 and added some more, and there are just too many to keep up with. I was a bit suspicious the first time I saw part 2 to see many part 1 characters reappearing, but in the end it worked pretty well. Not so this time.It also seems like they scooped up all the best bits to make the trailer - in fact, quite a few scenes seemed to have been created JUST for the trailer.Some good moments though, but just not enough to make this a memorable film in its own right. And some of the animation is wonderful, and the subtleties of character animation (esp in faces) is perhaps the best of the 3 films, which is why it's a 6 not a 5.Stop there, folks - you're great animators and story tellers, but it's time for a new project."
141,Shrek the Third,4,28 June 2007,"A few good moments, but  ...","... doesn't make a good movie! I think my nephew, my niece and her friend enjoyed the movie more, especially because of the fact that Justin T. played in this one too. Although they tried to come up with good new ideas, many just didn't work out (for me). One thing is sure though: A ""Puss-N-Boots"" spin-off could be really great, especially if Donkey is in it too.The chemistry between the two of them in this movie (and a ""crazy"" thing that happens to them) does elevate it. Although it seems like Antonio Banderas got the cooler lines than Donkey, it didn't bother Eddie Murphy. I personally think, as far as Shrek goes they should stop with this one ... A donkey spin-off would be great too, but no more Shrek for me please! (Edit: I take that last sentence back and hope they stop with the forth Shrek movie!)"
142,Shrek the Third,6,23 June 2007,The happy meal toys were better than the movie,"Shrek one was amazing, Shrek two was great, Shrek the third may have destroyed the series. Honestly I don't think they tried here, I think they expected us to go to the movie regardless of content. They got my 10 bucks.They gave Batman nipples and they somehow made Mike Myers boring.It takes a special kind of magic to do that, and Hollywood is magic.I knew there was going to be a problem when (scene 2) the king died and the Wings ""live and let die"" song started and not one laugh in the audience was heard. It was quiet.Pity too, Shrek was great. I'll buy it again on HD DVD when it comes out but this one I wouldn't buy this one VHS tape for 99 cents."
143,Shrek the Third,7,22 June 2007,Neither the best nor the worst,"I went out to watch it last night, and after reading some of the comments over here I expected it to be way worse than the first two ones. At the beginning I was VERY pleasantly surprised, it was actually funny and I hoped it would continue like that. After about 20 minutes it starts to rely on its story, which definitely was a bad decision. The story just doesn't have the momentum to catch the watcher's attention. But for the most part that really isn't a problem. There are LOTS of jokes and funny scenes, especially with reference to the modern pop culture (the school scenes made really cracked me up...). I think it doesn't match the level of Shrek 2, but it comes pretty close, and it definitely isn't the by far worst part of the trilogy. It is pretty much on par with the first one and a worse than Shrek 2, but for sure it is worthwhile watching!"
144,Shrek the Third,5,20 June 2007,"Hoped to watch a blockbuster, unfortunately saw a lackluster","Shrek 3 is far far away from reaching the status of its prequels. After reading many reviews, I felt that Shrek 3 would be still liked by me as I love Shrek films for their witty humor. Unfortunately, there was no witty humor in this film.1) There were a plethora of fairy tale creatures. Many of them were not at all necessary. Examples are the cheerleaders, Repunzel, some of the evil characters etc.2) Artie didn't exactly look like a geek. When you think about a geek, what normally comes to your mind is a dull, spectacled person who is scared of many people.3) Most of the humor was just copied from the prequels. What was there in Shrek and Shrek 2 was carbon copied in the film.4) Artie's voice was too irritating. You need a different voice for portraying a geek. Also, Snow White was obnoxious.5) Snow White's singing lures birds and animals towards her, so her singing obviously has to be extraordinary. But I didn't find her voice good at all. Plus, when she screeches so that the creatures attack the trees, it does not look funny but stupid.6) There was so much talking in the film. Artie keeps on droning like a monologue and becomes hysterically irritating.7) The script is below par. Too many fairy creatures spoiled the broth.8) Donkey wasn't that obnoxious and funny as he was in the previous films. I still miss that.9) When Shrek dreams about being dominated by children, they show it so that the audience laughs. But it was nowhere near funny.10) Humour seemed to loud in the film.Some things in the film were all right like the ending where Fiona and Shrek take care of the children, donkey's love for his children, parody of Harry Potter's professor Dumbledore as an eccentric, wacky headmaster. But overall, it seemed as if the producers had made this movie just to cash in some money. 5 out of 10."
145,Shrek the Third,,19 June 2007,What's going on with parts 3?,"I have been watching the third installments of three major franchises, Spiderman, Pirates, and Shrek, they all sucked!!!The last time we had a good third act was with Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith truly improved Lucas's mediocre Episodes I and II.I'm not counting The Return of the King, because as Peter Jackson said, it's all a very big over 9 hour film divided in three, and besides the literary work was there since the 50's.But it's a real disappointment that all of the above movies turned out so bad, Spiderman and Spiderman 2 were good films, filled with action, drama, comedy, tragedy, and triumph, but 3 was just too much coming and going without getting anywhere. I never liked Pirates 1 and 2, but at least they were watchable, At World's End is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I nearly walked out halfway through. Shrek 1 and 2 were very original and funny, but they lost it with these one.It seems Hollywood is more interested in the mega super-production, and marketing targets and promotions for its third installment films, but they are completely forgetting quality, character development, good acting, good stories, and even good action!How I wish Peter Jackson makes The Hobbit or The Chidren of Hurin happen, because ever since the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and a few others from franchises (Revenge of The Sith, Rocky Balboa, The Goblet of Fire), the sequels or prequels, have been turning out to be total excrement!"
146,Shrek the Third,6,19 June 2007,Awful!,"I'm sorry to say that, but that's what it is: awful! This is not Shrek, it's just another cartoon. A terrible sequel, made just for another box office title. Shrek and Shrek 2 were making fun of all the classic animated movies (especially from Disney), while Shrek the Third become the very kind of movie that the other two were making fun of. In contradiction with POTC - At World's End, which is stupid, but fun and enjoyable to watch, Shrek the Third has nothing, it's quite boring, except for two characters: Donkey and Puss. They rich out to take this movie on higher levels for short moments, but that's it. I gave this movie 6/10, and I think it's very generous of me! For the producers: ""Don't do this again unless it is worthing for all of us, not just for you!""."
147,Shrek the Third,5,18 June 2007,Not the best,"I had always thought that Shrek the Third would be something worth waiting for. I watched it with my friends at times it was funny but then it started to go on and on. It was repetitive, and the funny moments weren't as original as they used to be. The whole story sounded like they copied something from an old cartoon. It was kind of a bad influence on other kids. If you'd watched it with kids around the age of 13- 15 you would understand that it is not the same. The puns in the commercial are so lame. ""The wait is ogre"" the wait is over and when you watch it Shrek fans you'll cry. Honestly it is so disappointing if you want to watch a real movie go watch Nancy Drew or Pirates."
148,Shrek the Third,5,18 June 2007,A disappointing sequel,"The movie was okay. Pretty much, thats the only good thing I can say about this. Some scenes were funny but they weren't frequent enough to sustain the whole movie like its two instant classic prequels could do. The beginning was slow, the end was simply dull and stupid and the only good thing about the story line is the introduction to more fairytale characters like Arthur (King Arthur) and Snow White along with all the other snobby little fairytale princesses. Shrek having children was an alright subplot but it really was not enough to make this movie 'good!' So I highly recommend if you want to go and see a classic fractured fairytale movie then see the first two Shreks but save yourself the disappointment and don't see this one."
149,Shrek the Third,4,17 June 2007,how to destroy a good concept for a movie?,"If you want to completely detonate what was, one day, a good idea, you already know what to do. Call Cris Miller or Ramam Hui. Or give a try with one of the seven how are the responsibles for screenplay. Seven persons and neither of them could come up with a single joke. Because if you actually laugh in this movie, well, congratulations. You are better than me.The first movie was a surprise. Fresh air in a sort of movie that have end up in the same cliché of Disney - you know, a princess, a brave guy and lots and lots of moral lessons. The second one continued to be creative and different. Then, the tird movie. I'm pretty sure there's a curse about this particularly part of a series of movies. Spider man, pirates than Shrek. All of them a disillusionment, to say the less.Donkey and Puss in boots are, without a doubt, the best characters. Even Shrek is irritating with his personal crisis. Charming is not exactly what I would call a villain, but that's OK. The best - or the less stupids- jokes happen when he is in the scene. Technical speaking, is great. But how cares? Every single movie today are full of special effects. What really make a movie is the history. And, in this point, Shrek 3 is simply horrible."
150,Shrek the Third,4,16 June 2007,And excuse for another Shrek (slight spoilage but nothing major),"This film was completely lacking. It was incredibly short- over too fast and far too predictable. The music selection was bland, as in I heard all of the songs before. I liked the earlier movies better as they had sort of strange, unusual and neat new music from smaller artists.Most of the humor was ""dirtier"" (I don't mean to sound lame) with an emphasis on Fiona's pregnancy, implications of it, swearing being covered up by the ship's horn, Merlin's clothes not long enough to cover his (cuts off)...This need to extend the funniness out of a lack of better material is apparent in the scene when the frog King (Fiona's father) dies (3 times... waking up again to finish his last words after ridiculously exaggerated gasps of air) and was in no way funnier than if he had just died. (In fact that might have actually created tension in this otherwise meaningless story) Another shot at humor occurs in the high school, when the girls use language such as ""totally"" ""like"" and ""duhhh""- which also was not funny considering how unoriginal and predictable it was. All over I was very disappointed with it. And I'm a HUGE fan of Shrek I & II. My favorite was Shrek II since the storyline, complex characters, music, computer graphics and humor all seemed to be at a much higher level than the first- which I had memorized all the lines of. The story took many turns, was refreshing in its wit, and seemed to me the ultimate sequel- one that blew away viewers by beating the original- a rare feat. But Shrek the Third... not so much. I hate to ruin the magic for Shrek lovers, but it's just not worth the 8+ dollars to see."
151,Shrek the Third,6,16 June 2007,"Disappointing, but not bad by itself","When the first movie in a trilogy wins the first-ever Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and the second movie becomes the 3rd highest-grossing motion picture in American History, there is bound to be some very high expectations for the third film. Unfortunately, Shrek the Third will join a long line of threequels that has disappointed fans of the trilogy (see Godfather Part III, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones 3, etc.). The first two movies thrived on a perfectly blended combination of smart verbal and visual humor and random, ""what the hell is that?"" humor. For instance, the Disneyland and Hollywood references in the first two, along with the Girl Dragon and giant gingerbread man, make for a hysterical combination in both movies. Shrek the Third really contains none of either type of humor. It's as if one of the filmmakers felt that they had wasted all of their silliness on the first two and had to present a serious and coherent moral in the third film. Shrek, however, is not a franchise built on presenting serious morals in serious manners. It presents these kinds of morals in ways that kids will comprehend without knowing that they are comprehending them.Now, if you can get past the expectations built up from, and the comparisons to, the first two films, Shrek the Third is not all that bad. It has some funny moments, notably poking fun at high school, and some more serious moments. True, it's not as funny as the first two, but it's still funny. It's not as smart as the first two, but it's still smart.Simply put, Shrek the Third is a classic example of a movie studio going one movie too far, hoping to cash in on the previous installment's monumental success. What resulted was a desperate attempt to stretch a plot line built for one movie, maybe (and more logically) two, over a third movie. What it lacks is novelty; Puss N Boots is no longer funny because he's new, Donkey is just starting to get annoying, and recycled jokes over three movies never work (see Pirates of the Caribbean: AWE). What it has going for it is some new characters, decent animation, and... well, decent animation.It's an OK movie by itself, but it is very hard to overcome the comparisons to the first two. 6/10"
152,Shrek the Third,6,14 June 2007,It feels as if something is missing...,"Alright, now I will admit, this movie made me laugh. Do not get me wrong on that. However, what I have mostly decided that this movie lacks compares the other two is the quality that allows it to be funny again, and again, and again.Instead, this is more of a Wow. That Was Funny...but then it fades, and doesn't really stick out to you after a little while.For me the two biggest problems with the plot, was -There were several scenes that tried to create a message, a nice warm touchy feely message. Now, many will argue that the first two had that as well...only instead of subtly figuring out what the message is, it gives it to you. It makes it feel forced and cuts off the flow of the movie.-Unlike the other ones that have a fully contained plot, wrapped up nicely with a bow, this one has some tangents.**MINOR SPOILERS** For example, it is never revealed why the fairytale characters shun one of the step sisters and charming. They just do.There is no development made with Charming's sudden marriage. It is sort of just...there....Certain things like Ooo...this is my cousin's boat, are just thrown at you, and you simply must accept it.**END OF MINOR SPOILERS** But really, don't let me discourage you. If you genuinely liked the other two, go ahead, see it, laugh, but don't expect quite as much as the other two"
153,Shrek the Third,5,12 June 2007,no longer a fairytale,"By now it has become apparent that animation has mutated to a state, that with each new computer animated film, the quality will constantly increase, where time will arrive we will not realise we are looking at something computer generated. It's awe gasping to marvel at what is achievable. But a very beautiful picture is all Shrek the Third will ever be. No longer a parody/satire of fairytale stories of old, of childhood memories, it's terrible to see when all things pop culture and easy jokes become the norm. Shrek 2 started this norm, though rising above this limitation, kept proceedings fresh and interesting; with new characters added to the mix and keeping its fairytale roots close to heart. A big heart still resides in Shrek the Third, the main driving force of the whole film, but those fairytale roots have been crushed, replaced with schmaltzy, over sweet life lessons to drag it down. All of the Shreks have held those 'life lessons', but only as after notes, to think on the way out. Shrek the Third is a constant lesson class; never judging yourself by others opinions, family and responsibility. The little ones will soak it up with glee, starring upon their cinematic heroes, yet the older generation will feel tiresome by halfway, wondering where that adult humour went from the last two films. Maybe if the laughs were up to snuff, Shrek the Third could reside with its predecessors, the jokes have run dry and bland. The whole reliance of pop culture and in-jokes; not helped with Justin Timberlake added to the bill - he ain't bringing no sexy back to help boost this, but bitching beauties with Snow White, Sleeping Beauty Rapunzel and Cinderella, acting from some forth rate soap opera; maybe some classy Dynasty cat fighting would have helped, is tiresome from the go, and clichéd high school kids; girls talking like drones of Little Brittian Vicky Pollard and Mean Girls, spewing 'whatever' and 'ew-eth' at nauseating rate, Bill and Ted stoners, cocky jocks, and the braced up nerds. Enough material keeps proceedings above the water, yet not far from drowning. Charming's plays at the start and end are highlights, and the few out of the blue jokes. It's sad when events like a crazy aged Merlin, Puss and Donkey's body swap, are real missed opportunities and never really russel up the punch they require. All stars returning to their roles, own them easily like a second skin, many of the new actors bring nothing special; which is hard as they have no good material to work off. Shrek the Third runs far off course from it's predecessors, sitting now squarely in the kids section. Shrek the Third - you said it honey, ew-eth."
154,Shrek the Third,6,11 June 2007,What happened to the Shrek Franchise?,"After seeing Shrek 3 yesterday I feel genuinely dissatisfied with the whole movie. I have to admit that I am a big shrek fan, and I felt happy with the second installment of the Shrek franchise, however Shrek 3 feels ultimately rushed and lacking in every department.The greatest aspect about this film is the animation and computer generated effects, the hard work by those involved shows and shines on the big screen. Certain scenes like when Prince Charming elegantly tosses his hair from one side to another are very difficult to achieve but Shrek 3 pulls this aspect of with style.For me this was about the only decent part of the film. The humor is still there but the writing just isn't as clever as it was before. I smirked but never laughed, and by the standards of the first two films this is very bad. Shrek 3 also needed more depth with characters. In the second film, the introduction of Puss in Boots and the Fairy God mother gave it some much needed style and charisma and kept it above par. However their are no introductions of any particually funny and new characters in Shrek 3 which is very disappointing. Another problem I had was that unlike the second film the climax in Shrek the Third is very disappointing and unexciting, and it arrives so quickly that I just thought where did this movie go? I mean it really doesn't feel like it goes anywhere. I noticed also in the cinema that I was in, that many of the younger kids were not laughing and that too signifies a big problem with the writing.Their are some nice ideas in Shrek 3 like a certain scene at the beginning involving a school, and some enjoyable characters like the English trees, but overall they just aren't played on enough for it too be funny.Shrek the Third is a bitter disappointment."
155,Shrek the Third,7,11 June 2007,"Shrek's still alive, but for how long?","Yeah, that's what everyone says: ""It's a disappointment!"", ""It lost it's magic!"", ""It's not what it used to be!""... Well, I agree, it's not that brilliant masterpiece the first two ""Shreks"" were, but it's still pretty good. There are still many great jokes, funny characters... Well, I must admit that new characters is just not as funny as the old ones. And... there are also a number of jokes, which are quite lame. But there are not so many of them, though. The most disturbing thing in the movie, it's ogre babies. Am I an only one, who thinks, that they're just disgusting? It's like Teletubbies meets... other Teletubbies. Ew! Gross! But it's just not enough to ruin a good movie, it's still fun to watch. And while Dreamworks keeps even this level of quality, I would love Shrek."
156,Shrek the Third,6,10 June 2007,Shrek The Third: Far Far Away from a perfect 10,"OK, don't let the headline fool you, Shrek the Third is a halfway decent movie. I was very exited for this movie to come out but had a gut feeling it wouldn't be very good the third time around. Well bottom, line you should always go with your gut. Out of the three trilogy's that came out this summer Shrek finishes in the middle. In this movie there was hardly a point. The movie was split between four people, Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Charming,who were never really together during the film, so it was hard to follow four people. The jokes were dry, and I never ended up getting more out of it than a chuckle. But on the good side, the animation was amazing, and the characters seemed real. I do recommend seeing the movie because maybe I just didn't like it and maybe you will, but being honest, it doesn't come close to Shrek 1 and 2."
157,Shrek the Third,,10 June 2007,"Pretty funny, but I miss the Fairygodmother!","In this movie I have to say something.........Im bored of Charming in this movie!!!!I hate the fact that he still wanted revenge even though he was humiliated and lost in the second movie! I have to say Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas were funny but they were not as funny as they were together in the Second Shrek movie. Mike Meyers was the same, and Cameron Diaz didn't have a big enough part in this one. I thought that this movie had a really long and harsh fight scene for little babies to see!!Kinda disappointed there!! Its sad they could have made this movie way better, but now I just have to give it 5 out of 10 stars!!!! Sorry dream works but you could have done better!!! Adios to a good Shrek 4, thats probably gonna stink to. You have to admit faults in this movie and there is lots of them. And I think that the Fairygodmother was way more funny and devil like than the villains in the movie. I mean when they all get together at the poison apple its kind of stupid. Hook playing a piano come on. Snow whites wicked step mother playing pool.........boring!!!!!Yeah. Please please me ddreamworks when u come out w/ Shrek the Fourth. I want to keep enjoying shrek movies!!!! W/ hope------ Missy"
158,Shrek the Third,7,9 June 2007,"terrible jokes, ridiculous situations, but great characters","Now, this movie, i admit, is very, very well done, the whole technology display is amazing, however, i've got to say that this movie has TERRIBLE jokes that has no sense at all, maybe one or two, but the others are just not funny.Now, all the situations, like shrek's nightmare was just ridiculous, and did NOT made any one laugh. but the ridicoulest thing of this movie was the whole thing about the play, why does charming has to perform in a play to kill shrek? couldn't he just kill him and not make any goddamn play? or is it that charming believes he has a lack of publicity or something? i don't know but i think it was unnecessary to make all that plot of the play.However, the characters in this movie were great, puss in bouts, donkey, Fiona, shrek, the gang of Pinocchio, the pigs, the mouses..., all they were amazing. the only character i didn't like was Merlin, he's so pathetic!!!!, but the best characters, obviously, was the princesses, snow white, Cinderella... all of them, my favorite one was the sleepy beauty. and of course it is funny to see all these women of fairy tails fighting...Anyway, this is a familiar movie recommended for anyone, just to have a good time and have one or two smiles..."
159,Shrek the Third,5,7 June 2007,NOT so Happy Ending.,"In the barrage of trilogy ending blockbusters, I figured Shrek The Third was a sure bet. Same actors, same writers and for the most part same development team. Unfortunately, once again I felt ripped off and suckered into another media hyped sequel, still living off it's past success.Shrek 3 continues where the second one left us, but this time the tragedy surrounds Shrek hesistance on possibly ruling ""Far Far Away"" after the King's death and inevitable fatherhood. Shrek, uncomfortable with the whole ""King"" thing, goes on a quest to search a better candidate by the name of Arthur (surprisingly voiced by Justin Timberlake.) Prince Charming, still irritated things didn't go his way the first time, rounds out up the other token villains seeks out to foil Shrek's plans and take over the kingdom.I really hate criticizing this movie but there was so much missing. The writers that wrote the screenplay wrote Shrek 2...so what happened? The plot/story itself was completely unoriginal, unsuspenseful and just plain boring. Fiona's and the King's identities in the first two where nicely place twists...this one: nada. In fact the movie was completely predictable. You ALWAYS knew what was coming next.Another thing that led to the fact that this movies stinks, is lack of humor. They almost took every single character on the previous installments and just ran them into the ground (see: Police Academy 6.)Annoying Donkey was annoying now and Puss in Boots' cute face trick wasn't cute anymore. Yes, the cross-dressing bartender has deep voice..got it. Yes, Pinnochio's nose grows when he tells lies...hah, got that too. With the exception of few Gingerbread Man moments (that were actually pretty funny), the jokes were either not funny to adults or to hard to understand for kids.I seriously disappointed with this film. I feel either the writers got lazy with this one or maybe the well has just dried up and all good things come to an end. Wait for the box set."
160,Shrek the Third,7,7 June 2007,"Not bad, but I liked the first two better. This one is more for kids.","Shrek the Third returns to the original formula of subverting fairy tale stereotypes and lampooning fairytale archetypes by crossing them with modern day values. And it works, just like in the first two movies. The gags were funny, the animation was again crisp and smooth, the voice actors did a great job, (yes, even Justin Timberlake) and the jokes all have fairly decent timing. The problem was, the movie was kind of all over the place. In the movie, I counted no less than 4 different subplots, and I felt that in the end, they couldn't figure out how to tie it all together, which caused the ending to be very mickey mouse-ish and somewhat contrived.We had - shrek's impending fatherhood - arthur's blatant insecurity and social awkwardness - the princesses' defying their damsel in distress archetype - egomaniac prince's transparent plot for vengeance - donkey and puss in boots' new appreciation for each otherthat's all good and well, individually. But the problem was this made the movie lack a definitive focus in plot, and since all the characters were having their big revelation and character development happen near the end of the movie, we're not quite sure who the main hero was supposed to be. I got the distinct feeling that the writers had that problem too, as the role of the hero was now not just shared by say, Shrek and Donkey (first movie) or Shrek/donkey/Fiona/puss-n-boots (boots), but now shrek-donkey-Fiona-puss'n'boots-arthur-AND-princesses. And by the last confrontation, the writers realized that they can't make any one of them the hero that saves the day, so they had them all jump in, just to be instantly trumped by all the villains who jump on stage to take them. But then, by this point, the stakes were stacked so high that there was really no way for the situation to be realistically resolved without this movie edging into some physical violence and stepping into potentially PG-13 zones. So Arthur jumps in, delivers a passionate speech, and suddenly ALL of the villains melt and disarm. A little too ""Saved by the Bell"" for me.Bottom line: This is a good ""for kids"" movie, since it tries to deliver a positive message in a very explicit, if almost over the top manner. However, the more sophisticated tone and writing of the first two movies were removed from this one as a result of it. And to me, that makes this movie fall more in line with a lot of Disney movies."
161,Shrek the Third,7,5 June 2007,great movie,Much more entertaining than Spiderman3.I guess it was about as enjoyable as Pirates3 and I liked that.There was only one part you needed to see Shrek2 to understand but it was not super-critical.It seems to be getting poor reviews but I enjoyed it. I do like movies though.It was a cheap Tuesday when I went but I would have paid full price.I wish the studios would count the number of admissions instead of dollar take of a movie. That makes more sense to measure how popular a movie is. They could count both.
162,Shrek the Third,7,5 June 2007,"The weakest of the 3, still much better than most","As a kids/family movie, Shrek the Third rocks. The story doesn't hold together as well as the stories of the other two movies. But the kids (8 and 10) loved it. They continue to quote characters more than a week later, and references to some site gags (""gumdrop"") are instant laugh lines in our household.My problem with a lot of animated features is that the story is so slight that I get bored and stop paying attention. Recent movies where this happened to me: Over the Hedge and Flushed Away. While I don't think the story of Shrek the Third is as engaging as the stories of the other two Shrek movies, I didn't check out like I do for a lot of animated features. I expect we'll watch this one again and again over the next few years."
163,Shrek the Third,,4 June 2007,Shrek the third..... June 2007,"In my opinion, the movie Shrek the third, is a great movie!!! I like very much the message of the movie, because, it make us to see that we can be wherever you want and we must not influence for the opinion of the people.But in counterpart, Shrek the third, is not so good like other parts of Sherk. I think that the all public was waiting more of the third part because the second part of Sherk wan an incredible an amazing movie In Sherk the third, exists a part of movie that doesn't catch my attention, but lucky for the movie, there exist the prominent figures like the donkey and the cat with boots that always make you smail and to save the movie."
164,Shrek the Third,4,4 June 2007,"""Whose ready for thirds?""-after viewing, not me.","Shrek was great. Shreak 2 was very, very good. Shrek 3 was poor, at best.I mean, is comedy that hard to write? Shrek is supposed to be, you know, funny. Merlin (Eric Idle) was great, and Pinochio has (near the end) a great bit, but the rest is lacking in humor.The plot was clear, and drawings/renderings superb (the best yet, IMO), and each individual character was played well. But the script was lacking in humor. It did have it's moments, but overall, it was dry. Blame the writers, not the actors, for this one.I gave it a 4 because it was better than Pirates 3, but that is not saying much."
165,Shrek the Third,,3 June 2007,Born to be king.,"Takes place sometime after the events in the Shrek 2. King Harold is at a dying state. And when he pasts away Shrek will have to take his place as king. Shrek however, doesn't want to take that role, as he'll have to leave his swamp for it. In luck, Fiona has a cousin name Artie, who is next in line to be king. So Shrek, Donkey, & Puss N Boots head out on a journey to find Artie and convince him that he's going to be the new king of Far Far Away. Besides that Shrek was asked by Fiona about how great it be if they'd start a family. He of course isn't too found of being a father as ogre babies are more rampaging than regular babies. And keeps having nightmares about it during the journey.Meanwhile Prince Charming, has been a laughing stock for what had happened in the previous film. For that he goes to the Poison Apple to cheer up all the fairytale villains that there's still hope in getting their own ""happiley ever after"". Will Shrek be able to over come his fear in becoming a father? Will Artie successfully become king? And will Charming be stopped for his plot to take over Far Far Away? For only being the third installment, Shrek the Third contains the usual and running gags, copyrighted music, and in jokes. However it feels much different than the first 2 as the opening and closing of it are made differently. I like how they used some ideas that weren't thought up in the previous 2, as well as more background character to spot throughout the movie. The downside is it's not above or the same as the first 2. As some of the scenes are obvious and a few that can be seen a mile away. I guarantee that there'll be more 3 funny scenes in the movie.But overall it's either a you like it or you don't like it movie. If you're a die hard Shrek fan, then you might like it."
166,Shrek the Third,7,3 June 2007,Getting in Its Own Way,"""Shrek the Third"" is funny and has big laughs throughout, and one gets the feel that this installment of the big green guy's story is completely unnecessary. The cryptic symptom of Shrek's demise is somewhat insidious. All the big laughs come from the supporting characters namely Pinocchio (Cody Cameron) and the Ginger Bread Man (Conrad Vernon). Justin Timberlake voices a great turn as Artie, heir to Far Far Away Throne. He has a great scene where he says, ""Sometimes we all get in our own way"" This wonderful sentiment is so misplaced in this feeble attempt to empower faith in oneself. Also the movie should have heeded its own advice. ""Shrek"" the first was endearing in its message of seeing beyond appearances and finding the value of a person's or ogre's soul. ""Shrek"" also had a great sense of humor about life and itself. Apparently, the makers of ""Shrek the Third"" have forgotten this legacy. And there are too many involved. Chris Miller is director along with co-director Raman Hui. Still based on the original book by William Steig, there are a horde of writers: Jeff Price, Peter Seaman, J. David Stern, David Weiss, and Jon Zack. Consequently, ""Shrek the Third"" is blurred. The movie is funny; however, the laughs are of the sitcom nature. Some of the gags themselves are bewildering. For example, the extended death scene of King Harold (John Cleese) gets old until he finally ""croaks"", so to speak. The playing of Paul McCartney and Wings' ""Live and Let Die"" at the funeral is out of place and irrelevant. Also who is the main audience of ""Shrek 3""? Old people like me or kids? Kids don't know Wings, much less The Beatles. ""Shrek the Third"" is perfunctory funny, but the fairy tale well has gone dry. Rather the writers did not create something fresh, instead polishing a retread.As ""Shrek the Third"" opens we find Prince Charming (very funny Rupert Everett) doing very bad dinner theater. Shrek (Mike Myers) and Finona (Cameron Diaz) are filling in for the royal duties of Far Far Away Kingdom, and not really having a good time. So when the King finally dies, Shrek is next in line to the Throne. Unless Shrek can convince Prince Artie (Justin Timberlake) to assume the kingly duties, he will be unable to return to his beloved swamp. Thus, Shrek along with sidekicks Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) embark on mission to retrieve young Artie. Meanwhile, Fiona and mother Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) remain in Far Far Away. Fiona also confesses to Shrek before he leaves, that he will soon be a father. Shrek outwardly does not assume the tower of fatherhood. A ridiculous subplot involves Prince Charming's claim to the Throne. High jinx abound, and there are some touching heart to heart conversations between Shrek and Artie. Unfortunately, nothing really special distinguishes this third go round of the lovable Ogre. The supporting characters seem to corner the market on all the funny lines. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Antonio Banderas are all great as Shrek, Donkey, and Puss. Cameron Diaz seems relegated to the sidelines in this outing. Rupert Everett provides comic relief as the totally self absorbed and clueless Prince Charming. Perhaps, the movie's only freshness comes from Justin Timberlake as Artie.Other than Timberlake's Artie, ""Shrek the Third"" really shows signs of wear and tear. Here ""Shrek 3"" even eludes its connection to pop culture. There is a forced ""hip-hop"" conversation between Shrek and Artie. ""Shrek the Third"" suffers from a stand alone gag structure. There is no coherence. Perhaps, all of the charming and sweet fairy tale essence has been weaned dry. The message near the end about believing in oneself is noble, but seems tacked on and out of context. ""Shrek the Third"" is over wrought, funny, and really not worth seeing. Perhaps, ""Shrek 4"" will recapture some of what made it so special. Then again, it may be time to move on to something new."
167,Shrek the Third,6,3 June 2007,Shrek the Thud,"""Shrek"" was a delightful film, featuring a fresh animation style and a lovable ogre. Unfortunately it made a lot of money; hence, the inevitable sequels. This one is less than inspired, with a tired script that seems to run out of ideas. The comedy is stale, with only a few chuckles here and there. The funniest bit is the frog king, whose death scene drags on forever. The all-star cast of voices is nice but cartoons are only as good as the story. There are too many characters crammed into a flimsy plot. As a result, it feels episodic and underwhelming. The worst part is knowing that Shrek IV is on the horizon."
168,Shrek the Third,4,2 June 2007,The third the worst by far,"No story, no fun, no personality. I think this is the summary of the film. First one was something new, fresh air. Second one was a little bit irregular but with unforgettable moments and new and great characters, I think (and this is a very personal opinion) the second one is even better than the first one,there is something really charming and touching in there. Third one is just dull, in my view it should not have been released in theaters. Where are the witty dialogs? Where are the witty references to popular films? Where is the magic? Where is the story? Even the soundtrack is worst in this one. A piece of advice... don't waste your time watching this in theaters, look for something else.Disappointing."
169,Shrek the Third,6,2 June 2007,Many small laughs does not a make good movie,"That's what the whole movie is made of - many disjointed small jokes and humor to string together to storyline that is too one dimensional. The main story is so typical - it's for kids. But yet, small kids may not understand many of the humor. There are so many characters taking turn to show off but none that is deep enough to captivate the audience. You might hear the whole theater roaring with laughter at some times, but in the end, it was just not as entertaining as the previous two Shrek movies.Nevertheless, the graphic details is amazing. Thanks to the graphics designers and computer technology, the animation is delightful to watch."
170,Shrek the Third,4,2 June 2007,"If you must see it, see it only once.","The thing about the Shrek series is that it's great for families and adults too. It's sad to say the adults won't enjoy this one even though the kids will but then again, kids will eat up any computer animated film that comes their way. It's true that all of the characters are back but besides a few jokes that really hit, most of them are just bad jokes. Not good bad jokes either, just jokes that really miss and will make you wonder if what just happened is supposed to be funny. Also, Justin Timberlake's character is annoying (although I guess he's supposed to be a brat) and the minor characters aren't given nearly enough to say. This is entertaining enough to finish watching once but repeated viewings will not hold up. Considering that this is the Shrek series and how entertaining the first two were, that's very bad."
171,Shrek the Third,5,1 June 2007,Only for the kids!,"As always the highly anticipated sequel doesn't live up to the originals. While i was sitting watching i could feel my eyes slowly falling asleep. Maybe it was the caffeine from the coke or just the fact that this movie was incredibly slow for me. All the actors did great jobs, as they did previously. The basic plot of the movie revolves around finding the new king on Far Far Away but they run into a bit of trouble along the way. The movie has funny parts and insanely long moments of slowness. I would recommend only going to see this with children. They would love it! Personally I did not.Ash"
172,Shrek the Third,5,30 May 2007,A little bit of a let down,"This movie in the trilogy was a bit of a let down. The jokes were old, the story okay and characters tired. It would have been better if the first two movies were not so spectacular. I guess everyone in Hollywood is needing to cash in on a money maker for their babies mama's (Eddie Murphy). The interaction was bland and plot not much better. Prince charming was blah, and Cameron Diaz was just as boring. They belong together. Children will enjoy this as they do not know any better. Parents, you might want to bring a book along. I doubt there will be a fourth movie in this set. Between this and spiderman sucking this year, it is not a summer for movies."
173,Shrek the Third,6,29 May 2007,Fairy tale baddies seek revenge and Shrek goes on a quest to avoid the throne.,"THE FROG KING RULES!!! -Well anyway, that was the funniest scene in the whole movie and it came early so after that hilarious and promising bit Shrek 3 was only mildly amusing. I felt there were some missed opportunities in making some scenes funnier by what was shown and/or said. As I watched, I found myself saying, ""They should have done this instead of that"" or ""said this instead of that"".Shrek 3 is ""average"" and so I'm giving it 5 stars + 1 for the frog king = 6. It is best for children, I think; If I were a kid I'd give it 9 or 10 stars for cuteness and animation alone. But a grown person needs a little bit more edge, imagination, and cleverness than is offered; a bit more ""meat and potatoes"", if you will. There are, for example, many hard-headed prisoners who I'm sure would agree that it's not as simple as is portrayed towards the end of the movie. Couldn't they have come up with something ""less straight forward?"" Like maybe a ""key"", for instance (chuckle! chuckle!) So my final 2 cents is this: Highly recommended for kids (under 12, I'm thinking). Mildly amusing for Adults (except for the frog king scene, of course; that was a scream). Love, Boloxxxi."
174,Shrek the Third,,29 May 2007,Shrek 3,"Before I comment on it, to say the truth, I don't like watching Shrek movies. They are boring and not funny enough. I am not sure why I am watching this movie, is it because I heard it was good? I am not sure what came to my mind watching this. I thought of an excuse, a one good excuse is I love seeing the cute Puss in the boots. He is a character that makes the movie likable, in my reasons. I am not sure about that. All right, I have to admit that some jokes got me but the problem is that since this is made for kids, you can't expect big action or much potty humour, oh well, maybe I like watching big action. It is pretty like the previous Shrek movies, with more characters. The point...why can't the director make it exciting so that we don't have to say ""Oh my! It's another Shrek movie, and why do I feel like I have watch this before."" But, I have to say this one is better than the previous Shrek movies. In my choice, often the third part is better than the second and the first movies.If you have nothing better to do, like me, you might want to catch this or if you are a fan of Shrek, this suits you."
175,Shrek the Third,5,28 May 2007,"You Can Dress Up an Ogre All You Want, But....","Interesting, this. With this series, Dreamworks has somehow built a seemingly unstoppable franchise on a foundation of unoriginality. In fact nearly every element of these is a reference to some other film. Instead of writing a joke, these guys simply refer us to another joke we remember from some other movie. We don't laugh, we re-laugh.The mainstream movie business seems to be leaning this way. Entire films are being shot as I type this based on nothing more than fond remembrances. Thin nostalgia. It's actually shrewd business tactic at its best. The idea is to double your demographic: Target kids AND their parents. Whatever was a fad for you when you were 7 years old is sure to re-emerge when your kids are that age. It's also the opposite of what say, Pixar does, which is to actually engage the viewer on a deep level. To take our imaginations somewhere instead of just our memories.Until this. Well, sort of. This is the first offering by Dreamworks Animation Studios that I know of that at least tries. That it fails is beside the point. They should be applauded for effort.It's their first attempt at clever construction, and here's the idea: The story here is told on 3 levels simultaneously. The first (and most annoying) is our collective experience in movie-land. Second is the movie proper, the irrelevant tale of an ogre and a future king. Third is the staging of a play, which is actually based on the other two levels.If the first two levels are mild celebrations on movies themselves, the important third is a lavish ticker-tape parade, and was the missing element in the first two Shreks. Ultimately though, I'm not sure it's possible to pull this off when you're constantly dragging your audience's intelligence down with all those toilet jokes. Maybe next time they'll lower their poop-joke quota.Wonder if Dreamworks has a future king in their midst."
176,Shrek the Third,5,27 May 2007,What is old gets made into a sequel,"Ever since I was a little kid, I had a love/hate relationship with movies and books. I loved how they both created worlds of extraordinary people and creatures that I came to think of as friends. I hated that no matter how many follow up projects were made, eventually I would only be able to visit these characters by re-watching or re-reading their adventures. These visits were nice but not nearly as exciting since I already knew the outcome of the stories.Shrek the 3rd (2007) is a movie that brings back characters I know and love from the previous two films. There is the ogre Shrek (Mike Myers), the grumpy curmudgeon who has learned to make friends and care about other as well as his wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a princess that has learned to accept her inner beauty regardless of her outer looks. Donkey (Eddie Murphy), the lovably obnoxious mule that has learned nothing so far is back as well as the adorable and suave Puss N' Boots (Antonio Bandaras). All the characters are exactly as I remember them. Come to think of it, everything is exactly as I remember it. Nothing has changed for any of them.For me, Shrek the 3rd is like having friends come over to visit but they have nothing new to say. Every sentence starts ""remember when"" and no new memorable moments are created. Your only hope is that since everyone is a bit older, they will not stay as long. Unfortunately, this movie lasts as long as the more entertaining and original films it is following.As the movie begins, Shrek, Fiona and the gang are in Far, Far Away helping to run the kingdom while the king is sick. Eventually the frog king croaks (hey, if they can use lame humour to make this film  I can use it while discussing it!) and Shrek is told he is next in line for the throne. He doesn't want to be king so he sets out with Puss and Donkey to find the next heir to the throne. While away, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) tries to steal the throne with the help of other fairy tale villains and it is up to Fiona and the other princesses to stop him. By the end of the film, everything is back to normal with the exception of a few additions to the cast.So, Shrek is grumpy, Donkey is obnoxious and Puss N' Boots is cute. All the jokes surrounding these character traits feel recycled from the first two films which only add to my feeling that this movie was only made to cash in on the successful franchise. After all, there is no reason to invest in a better script when crowds of families will come and see whatever these characters are in. I know that all Hollywood movies are made to make money but I feel less a victim if they at least appear to care about the final product.Sequels and prequels are not automatically void of artistic value and merit. Not only can they continue to tell a story that is too large for one film, like the Star Wars Trilogy (or is it now considered a sextet?), these films can also concentrate on other characters in their universe to give them a chance to tell their stories. Does the lack of originality for Shrek the 3rd indicate that these characters have no new stories to tell? Should we be satisfied with mediocrity just as long as we get to see characters we enjoy? Well, since Shrek 4 and a Puss N' Boots spin off film have already begun talks, I guess only time will tell if they are going to breath life into this franchise. Until then, I will have to be happy revisiting these friends through the first two films and try my best to forget that the 3rd film even happened."
177,Shrek the Third,4,27 May 2007,Shrek the Turd,"This movie was a waste of money and time. I'm sure the producers will disagree and they will make millions based on promotional sales and products they disperse to consumers, but not me. The first Shrek was good, original and funny. The second was less funny and less original, the third just plain stunk. The characters were the same as always, no development or any great new characters, Artie was not a great new character, just a new one. The plot was boring, Shrek does not want to be the new king of Far, Far Away and looks to have Artie take his place. I went in on the idea there would be more mayhem from Shrek's new children, but they never developed until the last few minutes, less some nightmares that Shrek had. The jokes were plentiful, the laughter was less often. The one thing that I thought truly stood out from the second Shrek is the voice-overs were much better coordinated/in sync with each other this time around, which gave a better stage presence of the voices. But I will not be buying the Third on DVD, even if it goes down to $7.44 at wal-mart, to me this movie will go down as Shrek: the Turd"
178,Shrek the Third,6,19 May 2007,"The animation is great, but the rest just feels like a missed opportunity","Despite its heavy amount of popularity, I was never that much a fan of the original Shrek. It had laughs, and a great story, but it just did not completely jive for me. Something was missing, and I was left devoid of any of the enjoyment everyone else got from it. Years passed, and after Shrek 2's release, I actually was impressed. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and felt it more than made up for the shortcomings of the original. So with Shrek the Third, I obviously had some hopes that it would at least attempt to live up to the second film. Unfortunately, no such luck.While the trailers have basically gave the entirety of the plot away, I will give the briefest of explanations. The king has perished, and the heir needs to take the throne. Shrek (Mike Myers) is obviously not fitting of the job, so he takes Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) on a quest to find the second-in-line, Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) cousin, Artie (Justin Timberlake). Meanwhile, Fiona and her friends are stuck in Far, Far Away as Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) is assembling a group that will help him become king.What one notices straight off the bat is that the film is a whole lot more mature than the others. There is very little to goof around about, as the majority of the film is very plot and dialogue driven, unlike the other light-hearted films in the series. Not to say that this film does not have its share of the silly wit that made the other two films popular, but it just feels like it was not of the utmost importance here. This one, dare I say it, is extremely serious about what it wants to accomplish, and it tries its best to stay on that course from beginning to end. You can tell in certain scenes that this way is working, but in others, it just looks awkward.As well, the overall darkness and adult humour is almost through the roof with this film. Very little, if any of the jokes that do not involve farting, pooping or being smelly, are directed at children. The rest are totally thrown right at the adults, and it is practically sink or swim with most of them. And even the best of jokes do not work, because unfortunately, they are not all that funny. There are a few drop dead hilarious moments littered throughout the film, but the majority may just raise a smirk if anything at all. The earlier films had very clever references to adult-style humour, and they were very well disguised. Here, they are out in the open almost blatantly, and they have just lost any of the cleverness they could have had if they were hidden. They look, and they feel like the filmmakers did not want to put too much effort in, and instead just wanted to gun it towards another record breaking animated film.The story is another problem. It stays consistent in the directions it takes, but all of them lack the strength to motivate the audience to keep watching. The whole Artie being a social outcast seemed a bit too forced, and just to clichéd and obvious. The Prince Charming scheme starts off intriguingly, but as it keeps moving along, it just begins to flop (maybe because they realized halfway through that far too much of the plot seemed to revolve around him, and more needed to be said for Shrek and friends?). The filmmakers were clearly going for a more mature tone, but then why not make the story truly excel and not just feel like it was written by a second-rate has-been? But for all of its problems, the animation takes over and shows just how excellent it can be. If you thought that Shrek 2 had plenty of minute details, be prepared to see even more here. In a lot of cases, the characters look almost human in design, and would only look out of place because of how bright their clothing is. Their look has just been perfected to what I imagine is an all-time high, just waiting to be topped with totally realistic looking humans. When you have characters who get minor close-ups, and you can see just how much stubble is growing by the minute, can you really have anything less? It is a pleasure to watch, and was amusing to pick out some of the extras the animators threw in.The voice work is a bit here and there. Myers feels very held back, and does not seem to have the same amount of enthusiasm that he did in the first two films. He was having fun then. Now, he is just doing it because he has to. Same goes for Murphy, who while being ecstatic at all times, just does not stay on par for the entirety of the film. Diaz is sadly underused, and Timberlake is far too overused. I understood the need for it, but it just got annoying after awhile.Banderas on the other hand, is a standout for how much heart there is in his performance. Sadly, he is not used as much here as he was in the predecessor, but he does a great job anyway. Everett is on fire until the finale. I absolutely loved every moment he was on-screen, and I just wish they would have rewritten the entire end sequence. It only half flows as it is. Supporting talent from the likes of Julie Andrews to Larry King are all used very abundantly, and offer plenty of laughs and giggles.Sadly, Shrek the Third is only mildly watchable. The maturity of the film will turn children right off, but it still does not account for how obnoxiously botched an opportunity this was to make an even better sequel.6/10."
179,Shrek the Third,10,19 May 2007,Now THAT'S Entertainment...!,"We are acclimated to reviews and artificial 1-4 star ratings by news critics. But these people are bored wotj each new week's offering...52 weeks a year. They saw this as no exception. But an EXCEPTION it is! Here we have movie with CHARACTER, then characterS, a great storyline, fantastic music and stage sets within screen sets, monsters, conflicts, personal ambitions, evil ambitions, selfish and selfless acts, beautiful and classic scenes, incomparable heros and heroines from all the great movies of our childhood, with ribald scenarios and events, and a smash, smash, smash, smash ending.The best of the series, leave the tiny ones at home, bring your pocket Kleenex and come enjoy this movie. Be unashamed!"
180,Shrek the Third,1,9 August 2007,This movie is horrible! *not even remotely funny*,"Let's just get to the main point, this movie sucks...It isn't even the slightest of funny, the only time I laughed when I was in the theater was at things that my mind wandered to. And then I'd laugh and realize I'm watching a movie.The thing about Shrek now is that it is so repetitive! All that happens is he gets an issue where something is going to happen, he disagrees and he ends up on a quest to fix this issue, and he picks up a new friend; Shrek 1: Fionna, Shrek 2: Puss in Boots, and Shrek 3: Arthur. And he gets to where he needs to be and it ends, happily ever after, but not really! There just has to be two more movies, Shrek 4 and 5!! This is a nightmare!! Honestly the animation was great, but the comedy wasn't funny, the writers try so hard to make it funny it's ridiculous! The king's death scene was so long and dumb I sat there and literally said shoot me this isn't funny. I didn't even smile till after I dozed off and saw donkey and puss with their heads replaced with some of Shrek's babies heads and it surprised me and made me laugh because it looked weird. Only one joke was funny, but there no joke like it!! I'm not even going to try and tell you how dumb it is! Just flat out: Ifyou haven't seen it, IT IS BETTER TO JUST NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!"
181,Shrek the Third,1,3 July 2007,"Animation Superb, But as a Film Just terrible","Admittedly I've never been a Shrek fan, and find Mike Myers less funny with each film. Anyway I had to take my son and his friends to see Shrek and hoped that because I expected so little, I might end up enjoying it. The technical animation is the best I've ever seen, and never tiring to the eyes like Toy Story 2.As to the film itself I cannot remember enjoying a film less, it's just plain dull and boring. Everything is jaundiced and cynical, including heartwarming speeches. Is that the big joke? For instance Merlin wears a tunic which is too short, which makes him look silly, which is also a joke, but it's not funny. The half-empty cinema full of young families was mostly silent. Animation 10/10 film 1/10"
182,Shrek the Third,4,31 May 2007,Transgender Princess - Another Hollywood Brainwash Attempt,"The movie was just OK. Like other posters have said, the thrill is gone. The movie was predictable and the changing of the roles between the cat and donkey didn't go anywhere.What hacked me off the most was Hollywood's continue attempt to brainwash our youth into accepting alternative lifestyles - in this case transgenders. Why in the hell did they feel it necessary to add a transgendered princess to the cast? It did nothing for the movie and only hacked me off every time it was on screen.The only funny parts: 1) The death of the king frog and 2), Shrek's dream of all the babies coming into the house."
183,Shrek the Third,6,19 May 2007,Fantastic animation but lacking luster of first two,"Okay, so I was that idiot you met way back when who was the first to tell you that Shrek 3 was coming out. I was excited and yet I was wary (as I always am for remakes and sequels). My excitement has continued until tonight (19th), my first opportunity to see the movie. The animation was great, the message was over half-decent (though not as meaningfully forward as the first two), and even the plot line wasn't too bad. However, it was still lacking the luster of the first two movies. And I must confess, much of the humor was lacking compared to the first two. (Such as the Gollum/Cinderella, Shrek talking in modern lingo, Shrek's nightmare, Merlin,etc. And why was Eric Idle's Merlin not given the opportunity to soar in his role like I know Eric Idle can?) Also, the plot seemed to consist of way too much in-between time. This is because the makers wanted to develop way too much of a new plot and new character(s), but they depended a lot on your knowledge of the previous movies. But I am not one to be a downer, so now I must go and tell all my friends to see it because it will still make you laugh (a lot). The animation was amazing. The familiar characters and odd friendships (i.e. Gingy, Pinocchio, Grandma Wolf and Three Little Pigs) are so developed that you do take it for granted. Several parts were still witty, like 1&2... Of course there are too many things good and bad to say so I will still recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first two, but right now all I can remember is Gingy's hilarious flashback and that my popcorn didn't have enough butter."
184,Shrek the Third,8,19 May 2007,Shrek brings home the crown,"I am someone who looks at reviews, especially official press reviews as a gage of how a movie is going to be. Good thing I don't let these reviews deter me from seeing a movie, otherwise I would have missed out on the delight that SHREK the THIRD is.Picking right up from where SHREK 2 left off, we find our heroes dealing with the death of the king. Shrek is looked as the heir apparent. But there is another, Arthur, or ""Artie"", as he likes to be called, is away at school and Shrek, wanting to retreat back to his swamp, takes out to retrieve Artie so he and Feona can go back to just being themselves.Across the board, the voice work is right on par with the previous entries. Timberlake is very good as the would be king. The pop references and pokes at the world of fairy tales is once again on display. I find it curious all of the press critics who say this film lacks what the other two films had. I was entertained just as much this go around as I was with the first 2. Unlike Spider-Man 3 that tried to throw too much into one movie, SHREK the THIRD is tightly paced and outside of Arthur and a few others, there is no over crowding of characters or storyline.SHREK the THIRD, if anything, reaches for the heart more than the previous 2. I enjoyed that, as the fan base for these films has matured, it is only natural that the films themselves age, and in the case of SHREK the THIRD, they age gracefully."
185,Shrek the Third,9,21 May 2007,Loved this movie!!,"I was so surprised to hear people did not like this movie! I honestly thought it was just as good (if not more so) than the first two! Sometimes I just want to roll my eyes when I read that ""Shrek didn't have depth"" or whatever - he's an animated ogre, people. This is not supposed to be an Academy Award winning film, it is just supposed to be entertaining! Which it is, I absolutely loved it and I will snap it up on DVD as soon as it comes out! I like the addition of ""Artie"" (Arthur), and even though I am not a Justin Timberlake fan, I thought he did a good job voicing the character. Don't listen to what all the ""critics"" are saying, go have some fun and watch the movie yourself!"
186,Shrek the Third,3,20 May 2007,Not so good...,"This movie was not really the greatest. All the hype and anticipation was really disappointing...there was not too much Shrek and Fiona interaction. It lacked entertainment, I thought there was going to be more about Merlin, and the other characters involvement, but there wasn't. The first two movies were phenomenal, but this movie really did not do it for me. There a few good scenes, but just a few. This movie was way too choppy and was inconsistent in the movie. Donkey and Puss did not have many very lines, and to be quite frank, when they did speak it was not very funny. I would not recommend seeing this movie in the theaters...wait for it to be rented!"

188,Shrek the Third,4,9 June 2015,Three Too Many.,"Shrek the Third (2007): Dir: Chris Miller, Raman Hui / Voices: Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Justin Timberlake: Disappointing third film in the Shrek franchise. The theme is empowerment as ogre Shrek learns that he is next in line as King. When he learns of Fiona's cousin Arthur he sets out to bring him back in hopes that he will take responsibility as King and leave him to his comfortable ogre lifestyle. Structure is routine and similar to the first film. Mike Myers voices Shrek who learns of Fiona's pregnancy and stressed with the thought of fatherhood. He is the only character with any broad development as he attempts to ditch his responsibility yet accept another. Eddie Murphy voices Donkey and Antonio Banderas voices Puss N' Boots but both are more or less along for the ride as mere road movie props. Even Princess Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz seems to merely exist after informing Shrek of his future role as father. This is all done in glorious computer animation that is colourful and bright but without a decent screenplay it comes off as a great painting. Justin Timberlake voices Arthur, Fiona's cousin and second heir to the throne, and the role is a steal. Directed by Chris Miller and Raman Hui whose combined talent cannot bring life into this third and forgettable entry in a franchise that has just hit its last chapters. Score: 4 ½ / 10"
189,Shrek the Third,10,23 February 2015,Yung Moolah B4by,"I don't know what the freak the critics are thinking. Shrek was the best freaking movie ever. Are they smoking the good good or something? If so, I would like some because anyone who could rate Shrek the Third 6/10 should eat their own fecal matter and deposit the fecal matter just to eat it again, like the little fecal matter they are. The concept of Shrek the Third was just phenomenal. The characters, the plot, the animation, it was just bliss, like your mom's reproductive organ. You had Shrek, the OG baller baller, swag swag money, vagina-getter, and the most bad ass character you could ever find. Then you had that fine piece of butt, princess Fiona, providing fan-service, just like most of your right hands. In my honest opinion, I believe and pray that Shrek the Third deserved a 10/10."
190,Shrek the Third,4,10 August 2014,They should have just stopped after Shrek 2,"Even if this movie was decent, it would have been near impossible to top Shrek 2 (2004), a funny, well-paced comedy-adventure that eclipsed the original Shrek in terms of quality. Shrek the Third (2007) is just embarrassing.The jokes are uninspired at best and painful to watch at worst. The story had some potential, but it's so badly developed and feels as though it had been quickly slapped together because, hey, we need more money.What really kills Shrek the Third is its heartlessness. A heartless film is okay if the humor compensates, but seeing as this film is about as funny as an episode of Full House, that is not the case. It's a waste of time, even for those who like/love the Shrek series."
191,Shrek the Third,5,13 July 2014,So I watched this again after seven years...,"I remember watching this film in 2007 on a packed theater and being extremely disappointed by it. In the words of the great Roger Ebert: ""I hated, hated, hated this movie"", I was like, 14 at the time, and I think it was actually the first time I had been let down by a film on my entire life (although I remember being quite sad after watching Godzilla 98', even at age 5). I had loved the previous two films and I was so angered that the third film had turned out to be so dull and unfunny that I lost my faith on the whole franchise.. and yes! i still watched the fourth film (Shrek Forever After, i think...) but I waited for the DVD (actually didn't buy it, just rented it) and kept my expectations extremely low... and it kinda worked because I remember being quite amused by it.So, the other night I was surfing around the channels and I came across this film.. and I knew I swore I would never see it again but somehow I decided to give it a chance.. I didn't really have anything better to do... or to watch (thanks a lot basic cable!). So I watched the whole affair and once it was over I thought: ""Hey, this isn't actually that bad"". And don't get me wrong, I don't think this a good film, not by any stretch, nor does it hold a candle to the first two films. But I certainly find it funnier and much better that the first time I watched it (maybe it's the magical force of the low expectations taking place again... I don't know..). Maybe it's because now I get some of the more adult references this film has in comparison with its predecessors, or maybe I've come to appreciate more the raunchier humor. There are still two huge, huge problems with the film that I will simply boil down to two characters: Merlin and (specially) Artie. And... SURPRISE! They're practically the only two new faces that the movie brings to the table. They aren't funny nor special, their interactions with all the other characters feels forced and ultimately it feels that the film could do nothing but improve if they were absent.There are other problems with the film (mostly jokes that don't land or characters that feel somewhat off) but in the end, it's not that bad of a movie. I can recognize my extreme disappointment with it on its original release because the Shrek franchise was a big deal to me back then, but now on the eyes of a full grown adult, I think of it as a silly little movie I could totally watch on a silly Sunday afternoon without feeling to fall asleep or check my phone all the time to not get bored, which is kind of a compliment given the extremely low quality of Hollywood's children entertainment nowadays (and that's pretty sad, the more you think about it).5 / 10"
192,Shrek the Third,1,16 January 2014,Nothing but a snore fest,"This just could not hold my attention. Period. This was the first time I watched a movie in the theater and was genuinely bored throughout the entirety of it. It's that boring. Lame jokes, lame plot, lame all around. Honestly, Shrek should have just gotten a TV spin off after ""Shrek 2"". It would have been better than this. Honestly, what was Dreamworks thinking? Actually I doubt they were thinking when they came up with this crap! There was no effort put into this movie at all, it is pretty much throw away. Hell, even the voice cast sounds very bored, especially Shrek (played by Mike Myers). Also, don't even get me started on HOW MANY FREAKIN' CELEBRITIES THEY HAD TO CRAM IN! This is why I can't stand 99% of Dreamworks movies as they feel the need to cram in more celebrities than any other studio has had, and I'm not just talking about animated movies here. Heck, even their brother company, Paramount, doesn't even cram that many celebrities in their movies. Overall, this movie isn't even good enough for a rent. Watch it if you have trouble falling asleep at night and are either too lazy to buy or can't afford sleep medicine."
193,Shrek the Third,4,21 September 2013,What the.....?,"Time for me to review one of the worst sequels ever: Shrek The Turd. Shrek and Fiona's (Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz, respectively) fairy-tale wedding has gone off without a hitch, yet just as the beaming newlyweds prepare to enjoy their blissful ""happily ever after,"" the sudden death of King Harold (John Cleese) finds everyone's favorite ornery ogre being reluctantly fitted for the royal crown. Troubled to learn that not only will he be compelled to rule Far Far Away, but that he and Fiona are also expecting a little ogre, Shrek determines to track down his new bride's rebellious cousin, Artie (Justin Timberlake) -- the one true heir to the throne -- in order to focus on fatherhood without the added distraction of having to preside over the kingdom. As Shrek sets out with faithful companions Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to locate the medieval high-school slacker and bring him back to become the reigning sovereign of Far Far Away, handsome snake Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) slithers back to the castle in the company of the dreaded Captain Hook (Ian McShane) to stage a diabolically timed coup and assume control of the throne. Now, as Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots do their best to wrangle up the feisty Artie, Fiona must enlist the aid of fighting princesses Snow White (Amy Poehler), Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri), Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph), and Cinderella (Amy Sedaris) to barricade the castle and fend off Prince Charming's invading army of fairy-tale villains until her beloved husband can return with the cavalry to save the day. ~ (Jason Buchanan, Rovi) The first Shrek came as a welcome surprise: it was funny, well animated, and well acted. The sequel was also those as well, and it naturally progressed the story. Shrek The Third is a cobbled mess. Filled with too many pop culture references for my taste. And the story here is complete and total crap, whoever wrote this script should hang their head in shame. Nothing here is funny, charming, or even entertaining. It feels so contrived and forced. Ugh! Just because it is a kids movie doesn't mean you have to make it so insulting to our intellect. You got your poop jokes, your pee jokes, and all that other crap you have grown to hate in kids movies. Oh, and let us not forget the ""Switching bodies"" storyline we've seen a thousand times before done better than this. But I will say this: The film is well animated and well acted. But those are the only positives I can think of. Add all this up and ta da! We got another third entry that manages to disappoint fans and critics alike! Sorry Shrek, but perhaps you should go back to your swamp."
194,Shrek the Third,4,19 February 2012,"Promises much, delivers little","The weakest Shrek film. Feels like it was hashed together quickly with little development to the characters or plot. I mean, this is Shrek. A massive film enterprise with all the resources and funding at it's fingertips. By part 3 it should be incredible. What the Shrek films do best, by definition, is to re write classic fairy tales and characters in a new modern and 'funny' way, right? So it should be. But in this film - it fails. Big example - and here is the spoiler - is this is the moment in the Shrek saga where we are introduced to Arthur and Merlin ! The 'Shrek' version of Arthut and Merlin should be an explosive and hilarious highlight in all of Shrek films. My god, it really isn't. Arthur (voiced by Justin Timberlake) sounds exactly like Fry from Futurama but with not even 100th of the quality of the jokes. Merlin (voiced by Eric Idle) turns up in a holographic blaze of promise but then is hardly in it at all after that. No character development, no banter between Arthur and Merlin. They go absolutely nowhere. The voices and the look of the characters do not even suit. It could have been so classic but it just isn't.The whole film feels lazy and uneven. It meanders and splutters it's way heavily through the weak plot and never really gets going. Certain scenes are massively overwritten with too much dialogue, i was constantly distracted throughout. The worst thing about the Shrek films is those moments when you feel they are trying too hard to be funny. This film is pretty much like that the whole way through. This one's a tired old affair and no one feels like they are having fun. Thankfully, the 4th one was much better."
195,Shrek the Third,5,25 September 2011,The entry takes a lot of gloss off the series as a whole; a turgid and rather uninspired entry frittering away most of what made the franchise what it was.,"Directorial duo Chris Miller and Raman Hui are here essentially responsible for going some way in killing the Shrek franchise; their presence, away from the duo of Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson plus Ted Elliot in a screen writing capacity, is an ill-fated changing of the guard very much like the one threatening to unfold within the piece itself. Where 2001's Shrek and its 2004 sequel had a watchable charm, and were pleasant explorations of politics more broadly linked to what is defined as 'attractive' in the guise of the opposite gender, Shrek the Third is a loud; messy; unnecessary and really rather unpleasant edition. Where there was originality, there is now commodity; where there was a real sense of the first two being independent and nobody's fool, there is a depressing sense of conformity; where there was a subversive aspect about proceedings, there is a gnawing feel of pandering of an audience. Shrek and Shrek 2 felt at once grown up but with the ability to encompass childish things; ""The Third"" has this sense of just being annoyingly childish about grown up things.Following the lengthy adventures of the titular ogre, he of the Scottish accented Michael Myers voiced green beast, things have reached the here and now; Shrek living with his wife Fiona (Diaz) in the kingdom of Far-Far Away after thwarting evil kings governing huge castles and extravagant kingdoms as well as that of grotesque incarnations of fairy tail materialism in the form of a kindly elderly lady selling everyone things they seemingly need to feel happy. In the third outing, many, no doubt the makers of the film as well, would like you to think that the lead is on the brink of facing his biggest challenge yet: the threat of living as a ruling king twinned with that of operating as a father. The reality of such an 'honor' being bestowed upon Shrek begins to hit home when he takes on certain kingly duties when the existing ruler, John Cleese's King Harold and still in the capacity of an amphibian, is taken seriously ill - this leads to Shrek and Fiona falling afoul of the numerous tasks required in order to be the ruling bodies. Shrek, with things mounting up, begins to feel the heat and wants back to his swamp again. Respite arrives when he is summoned by the dying Harold who outlines that there is an opportunity for Shrek to pass on the mantle to another heir: that of a young nephew named Arthur located a fair while away.Mission in mind, Shrek sets off with his faithful accomplice Donkey (Murphy) and Zorro-pastiche Puss in Boots (Banderas) to find him. Singer Justin Timberlake voices Arthur, a wimpy student at a place hybridising Middle-Ages England with that of 21st Century American high-school. Timberlake's casting, and general use of the school locale as a place rich in the sort of dialogue; caricatures and persona's in embodies, is a sad instance of the film preening to a specific demographic whom need something familiar in their lives to latch onto when they watch something  a far cry from the other Shrek films trying to push boundaries and not bothered if its content felt alienated or off-kilter. It's here the film begins to feed off a buddy-pic combination between that of Shrek and Arthur as they trek back to the kingdom so that Arthur may rule and Shrek can have done with it all; the character a fresh supporting act nudging the previously taut and often amusing presence of Puss and Donkey to the sidelines to wise-crack at each other and offer the audience slight, disappointing asides.Shrek and Arthur are stark binary opposites to one another; they are, like any buddy combination, one another's foils and entrust one another to be each other's enemies for an extended period of time until a reality settles in. Little do either of them know at this point that they're far from it, but the pair of them do have a brooding responsibility of rather large proportions looming on the horizon, in terms of one having to rule as a king and the other to respectively deal with parenthood. There is a sub-plot involving the son of the villain from the last film, in that of Prince Charming (Everett), who's plotting revenge and rounding up all the nasties of Far-Far Away's kingdom to stage an overthrow of the monarchy so as to rule themselves, but it is largely uninteresting. Principally, its errors lies with how it utilises those supporting acts, such as Captain Hook and Snow White, from earlier in the franchise. Their charm always lay in the fact they were often off-screen or often remained in the background filling in for a visual gag or brief one-liner  here, they are brought to the forefront and are lent so much screen time that the appeal of their presence dissipates.There are morsels of a character study with Arthur; his clear elation at the prospect of ruling a kingdom seeing him promise himself ""princesses"" and ""castles"" which are sure to await him in plentiful amounts when he gets there - his seeing the light of responsibility through what he experiences on the trek home, and then later when he sees the would-be power he's due to inherit being mal-used by that of Charming, is slight and uninvolved substance. The Shrek franchise used to be a satirical, original idea which sent up Disney stories and fairy tales; it was a 21st Century incarnation of Vladimir Propp's folk story jabbing, a subverting of what it was that often passed for high-end Fable-esque drama  the whole thing has mutated into that of a soap opera, a soap opera involving unexpected pregnancies and meek character arcs involving people realising what their 'duty' is. Frankly, we find it all rather dull, chaotic and uninteresting."
196,Shrek the Third,,18 August 2011,Third time isn't really the charm for this franchise,"Third time might not be the charm for this series, but it's still a decent movie. In fact I actually liked this movie, sure it isn't good as the first two but it's a movie well worth the watch. Instead of a movie, it feels more like a episode of a CGI animated TV show except you can tell the animation is high budget and high quality. It may seem like there isn't enough effort that went into this third installment and may seem like a cheap cash in...Which might be somewhat true. But the movie has decent stuff going for it. Although this one has more characters than the past two movies, there just wasn't as much chemistry between them. I was constantly anxious for the movie to get better but it just seemed to get slower and duller. This isn't a terrible movie but lacked the cleverness of the previous two movies.5.5/10"
197,Shrek the Third,,20 July 2011,"I'm really, really sorry!","Now, I was a huge fan of the first two Shrek movies. Who wasn't? But I was a little cautious about this trilogy. Unless you count Harry Potter, Star Wars, or Indiana Jones, which all had fantastic trilogies (although Indy had a not so hot fourth movie), There isn't a franchise out there who had a trilogy and didn't regret it. I think Shrek has pretty much run it's course. There are probably some people who wanted to see them have babies. I know what they were thinking: Hey, they kind of left the sequel off at an ominous note, they need to finish off the series with a third movie and making them have babies is a good way to do that. And I agree. I bet you felt like Judge Smails from Caddyshack (""Well!? We're waiting!""). But the way they made the babies as unrealistic representations of what the average Seven-Year-Old boy THINKS babies look like. Seriously, wasn't anybody else annoyed? I was really hoping they would end the whole thing after this movie, but there are some people out there that sit around demanding for another movie after the fifth one comes out. So of course they do a fourth one that is just terrible, whether you watch the entire series or not. But that's a different review. I gotta eat some olives. Athena2264 OUT."
198,Shrek the Third,4,28 May 2011,They made this very near the expiry date and the smell is near sour..,"I enjoyed the first one immensely and the second one was decent. Shrek the Third however lacks the freshness because there are only too many jokes you can make out of the characters such as Donkey or that Pinnochio puppet.The plot also is a bit thin and to be honest a little lame. Shrek has had to take over as King as his father in law is on his death bed. Then he finds out there is a cousin of Fiona's called Arthur who can take over instead of Shrek having to do the work. Prince Charming also vows for revenge and to get his rightful place on the throne.The storyline is really weak and I honestly didn't really care about the plot because you know it's all gonna turn out happy anyway - it is Shrek after all, not a tragic melodrama that will make kids unhappy. The film borders on being ridiculous at times to plain annoying then to cliché in terms of its ideas. The character of Arhur was alright and was likable and Timberlake does a good voice of him but this is only a small accomplishment in terms of pulling the film's weight together.Dreamworks - you guys have made tons of money off the Shrek franchise - how much more do you want? Oh wait - there is the fourth movie and that Puss in Boots film coming up! Of course you would keep continuing."
199,Shrek the Third,5,20 May 2011,"Very disappointing. The first two movies were great, but this one wasn't very good at all.","I loved the first two films in the ""Shrek"" series. They were funny, had amazing animation, an all-star voice cast, good characters, and great stories. This 2007 third installment was a HUGE disappointment. The plot of the movie is: Fiona's father is dying, he wants Shrek to be the new king of Far Far Away, but Shrek just isn't fit for that kind of job, so him, Donkey and Puss in Boots set off to find the next heir, Fiona's cousin Artie. But when their ship sails away Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant.Now this is a good plot, but it all feels very forced. Donkey's lines aren't as funny or memorable, and some parts of the movie are honestly very boring. Now that doesn't mean the movie is horrible. The animation is as great as it always was, Shrek's dream about babies was very funny, as I've already mentioned I like the premise of the film, and Merlin was hilarious and almost saves the film. This movie isn't bad, but it isn't good either. One of DreamWork's Animation's weaker movies, but at least it's better than ""Bee Movie"" and ""Shark Tale"". To me ""Shrek the Third"" felt like a direct-to-video movie. It's just not very good, which is really sad to say, because the first two were excellent films. ""Shrek the Third"" is mildly entertaining, but not a movie I like to watch very often.Rating: 5/10 ""Average"""
200,Shrek the Third,6,14 February 2011,"The weakest link in the series, still entertaining","The third installment of the Shrek Saga shows an unhappy king-to-be Shrek, who starts a journey in search of Fiona's only cousin, Arthur, the second in the throne line, to bring him to Far Away so Shrek and Fiona can devote themselves to a quiet family life in their muddy swamp. However, Prince Charming has found the perfect plan to get the throne, convincing all the loser fairytale characters to become an army in search of their own happy-ever-after.The old characters are still as lovable as always. Some of the new ones are also very well drawn psychologically, especially the nervous insecure new age retired professor Merlin, beautifully drawn, with great movement and almost human in appearance. The drawing of the backgrounds is really stunning, detailed and funny regarding the names of shops, street signs, etc. The same can be said of the theater stage that Prince Charming prepares to become the king of Far Away, beautiful and so creative. There are still some funny moments. My favorite ones are the one involving Snow White singing to enter the castle, Shrek's dream about babies, and Gingerbread's flashback on his life.Despite the great visuals, the storyline is simple, more for children than for adults. The script is not as witty and original as the previous two, and some of the jokes and funny situations are, in fact, a repetition or extension of others already seen in the previous movies. The movie has very poor reviews and I think they are just motivated by the comparison with the other two Shrek movies, which are far superior in quality.No doubt, this is the weakest link of the Shrek series However, as a stand alone movie, if you don't compare it with the others, is still a decent one."
201,Shrek the Third,6,13 February 2011,Worst movie of the Shrek trilogy!,"After seeing the credits of this movie, I thought this one might be the best one yet. But I was sorely disappointed.The final battle was the most anti climatic of any I had ever seen. I mean, I could not believe how bad the writers blew it. Nobody with any common sense would believe the villains would just drop their weapons just because a young teenager said they didn't have to be evil.News flash, Dreamsworks, THIS IS NOT A BELIEVABLE SCENARIO!Why would the villains just stop their conquest when victory was in their grasps? That's like someone telling Hitler's men when they conquered their land, they didn't have to do it. Do you actually believe they would have listened to them? OF COURSE NOT!That's why this movie is a black eye to me when it comes to the Shrek Movie collection. Instead of giving us another epic battle like in Shrek 2, the writers took the cheap, lazy way out. Whoever came up with the idea for the villains to actually listen to Arthur should personally apologize to all the fans of the Shrek franchise.I would have rated this movie even lower, but I will give it credit for the fact it did have some cool things in it, like the scene where Fiona and other Princesses escape from prison and attempt to take back their land. It sadly had me thinking it was gonna get good now since most of the movie before that moment was either boring, stupid or gross.But, that's what happens when money is the major force behind a movie production. You get a film you rather use as firewood than watch in your DVD player again and again."
202,Shrek the Third,4,17 December 2010,Why?,"I really really enjoyed the first 'Shrek' film. What I liked about it was that it was edgy and merciless in the hate it harbored for the Disney clichés of fairy tale stories. 'Shrek' was a revolutionary concept. The character genuinely wasn't likable and he genuinely had to fully become a hero before we could like him. It was an adventure film with action and comedy perfectly mixed. I went into 'Shrek 2' reasonably excited, it was serviceable but really it was kind of lifeless. It was essentially a 'meet the in-laws' ordeal with none of the magic or character of the original. 'Shrek the Third' was hugely disappointing. I put off seeing it for the longest time because I feared what it could be and my fears were largely justified. 'Shrek' has essentially become the big cuddly Disney teddy bear he hated.Where could they bring Shrek as a character? Would it be too much to ask that he go on some sort of adventure? The first 'Shrek' had a thrilling scene with dragons and fighting to compliment the humor. 'Shrek 2' took a stupid approach of a family melodrama involving the in-laws and 'Shrek the Third' takes the next obvious step, baby drama. Wow. I don't necessarily mind this because there is a semi-decent scene where Shrek explains the legacy of being an ogre and how he doesn't want his children to experience it. That is really heartfelt and well thought out. If the film truly wanted to be about baby drama than this was the best way to do it. Instead of going further into this we get jokes about diapers and spit up and the like.What really gets me about 'Shrek the Third' and even 'Shrek 2' is how loveless Shrek and Fiona's relationship is. They are separated from one another the entire film and it is sufficiently disappointing. Fiona cannot be caged. I really love the character of Fiona, her charm, her spunk, and her self confidence are really encouraging in the face of the negative female stereotypes placed in front of young girls by the Disney corporation. Fiona spends all of 'Shrek the Third' waiting for the man in her life and dealing with stupid female stereotypes and this is disillusioning."
203,Shrek the Third,3,13 July 2010,Stay Far Far Away!,"The third installment in the Shrek series is about the duties of Shrek and Fiona as prince and princes. The king died and Shrek must take his place. Obviusly, he doesn't want to do so. His only hope is to find the next relative in the line of the throne and convince him of becoming the king so he and Fiona would live happily in their swamp.I don't know if it's just me or this movie is an entire (and cheap) rip-off of the first one. I mean both movies had Shrek reluctantly taking a trip to find someone so he could live peacefully in his swamp. The producers, directors were too lazy to make a ""new"" Shrek movie, but they had to do so in order to make more profits of this franchise so they took the first one, added a few characters (with awful character development) and this film was the result. The first one was good, the second wasn't that good but still was worth watching but this one is just bad.There weren't enough funny moments and those moments weren't funny enough to make this movie good. I don't recommend this film."
204,Shrek the Third,4,9 July 2010,Never really got going,"I loved the first two Shrek movies. Shrek 1 was very original, and sick minded. There had never been anything like it before. Hilarious! Shrek 2 took all that was good about the original, and made it into a better storyline, with new characters. I am sad to say Shrek the Third does not do the same.The Adult humour has gone, which was an essential part of the first two films, and there are too many characters. The plot is weak, and lifeless. The whole film seemed to be like a build up to nothing. The story never really got going. Several new characters are introduced into this instalment, including princess Fiona's cousin, Authur, and Merlin the wizard. All of the new characters are dull, and can not be loved as much as the Characters from the first two movies. Disappointing."
205,Shrek the Third,10,4 July 2010,The Third chapter of Shrek,"Here we come to the next chapter of Shrek. I went to see ""the Third"" with my dad, and we love it; and it was the first time my dad ever went in a theatre.Where we left from the second film, Shrek and Fiona were taking on the temporary duties as king and queen - and each a disaster. And it gets worse when Shrek's ""frogger-in-law"" passes away and feeling not up to the job of ruling Far,Far Away, he, Donkey and Puss set sail to find the true heir to the throne - Fiona's cousin Arthur Pendragon. Meanwhile, Prince Charming, joins forces with every fairy-tale villain to attack the kingdom, leaving the now-pregnant Fiona and the other princesses to form a underground Resistance movement. And that is all I could tell you, see the film for yourself.So, I love this film from beginning to end, and goes very well the first two Shrek films."
206,Shrek the Third,6,28 June 2010,The originality has gone but there is still a chuckle or two,"There was a time some 9 years ago when an animation was released that shone with the energy, the humour and the drama that was remarkably a Pixar beater. Shrek was an outstanding piece of entertainment, containing colourful reincarnations of fairy tales with modern skits and a fresh faced array of family enjoyment and somewhere along the way of overselling, 3 sequels it lost its freshness.Whilst the first sequel had plenty of zip and panache it didn't grab you the way the first did and this 3rd instalment tries to recapture the first's essence, and fails in that aspect but still packs some zippy humour and a relaxing hour and a half viewing.This story revolves around Shrek searching for a rightful heir to the throne of far far away whilst Fiona has a surprise for her husband and Prince Charming recruits a bunch of villains to take over far far away.There is quite a bit going on which gives strong humour opportunities if the momentum of certain situations is disrupted, not to mention this franchise's frequent attempt to add new characters never works. The dragon babies are ridiculous whilst getting Justin Timberlake, a professional singer, to voice a supposed heir completely abolishes anything short of credibility.Salvation is found as usual through Donkey and Puss in boots whilst there are lovely phrases and sequences with Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and Cinderella. A great new addition is Captain Hook who is not given enough screen time.Chris Miller directs well enough with the production at the finale a stand out, despite being ruined by a conventional speech motive. However when the gang circle around John Cleese's King there is an air of uncomfortably as it is produced trying to be funny when it definitely should not be and the scene with the singing frogs and unhappy face afterwards feels crudely disrespectful.Whilst these faults are usually frequent there is still a likable association with the characters as we know their tricks now and hopefully with the forth Shrek due out in recent weeks this series can match the first and give the series a grand send off.6/10"
207,Shrek the Third,5,10 June 2010,Three shrek's and you're out,People have a lot of affection for the first and second Shrek films and this one did prove to be a bit of a let down but judged on it's own it is a fair sequel that does have a lot of heart and charm. The plot as many have said is very ordinary and feels like one of those straight to DVD sequels that Disney made throughout the late nineties. It tries to pack in all the characters we've grown to love in these films but fails to do them all justice. It has it's moments but just cannot match the earlier films in the series. I believe the decision to wrap the franchise up after the fourth instalment may have been a wise move by Dreamworks.
208,Shrek the Third,3,16 May 2010,Post-modernism at the end of its tether.,"Poor, I am afraid. I've not seen the first two, and surely they are better.This film was tedious, making its 90mins seem like double that length. Predictable, cynically calculated soundtrack selections, targeting the forty-something demographic: McCartney, Led Zep, Ramones, Sly Stone and Damien Rice.It is a ridiculously 'star-studded' cast of voice artistes: everyone from old Johnny Cleese to Julie Andrews; Eddie Murphy to Ian McShane; Eric Idle to Justin Timberlake. Yes, plenty of names; but a paucity of character or impact conveyed by any of them. I suppose Rupert Everett is just about an exception, making his Prince Charming relatively memorable.Overall, this is uninvolving and insipid. Nothing to relate to or enjoy, particularly; just empty post-modernism."
209,Shrek the Third,6,29 December 2009,Lost the spark and charm.,"I watched this movie 2 years after it's release mainly because when it came out I felt the plot and characters lost that special something that characterized them in the first two.The animation is great, the dialogs are funny, but the plot is not interesting, the characters do not seem to get along ""well enough"" and the addition of more endearing characters feels rushed.The plot sounds like a great idea but it isn't executed adequately. ""Shrek The Third"" feels like just a regular episode of any modern cartoon.""That"" special feeling when things were solved in the previous 2 is totally absent and you don't really get to feel something for the plot or the characters.The movie lacks of a spark and felt very rushed."
210,Shrek the Third,,13 August 2009,Shrek has lost it!,"'Shrek the Third' lacks the energy, charm, authentic humour and novelty of the first movie. The second movie may not have been a match for the first one but the story had heart. There's also a moral in the third movie but it is presented in a clichéd and preachy way. The story lacks soul and it's not even interesting to begin with. The jokes feel recycled and most of them fall flat while a few manage to draw a chuckle or two. It was difficult for me to keep my attention as I was losing interest. The voice-cast seem to have lost some of their effect and the new additions are quite bad, especially the voice behind Artie which is truly horrendous, with the exception of girlfriends Fiona's mom, Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel. Their sequences were the funniest and perhaps the best thing in the movie. Amy Sedaris, Maya Rudolph, Amy Poehler, Cheri Oteri and Julie Andrews have done a fine job. At times 'Shrek the Third' felt like one of those straight to video Disney sequels. That said, the animation remains consistent with the first two films and the quality is very good. The film is not bad to 'look' at but it's mostly a poor watch."
211,Shrek the Third,7,12 May 2009,"Enjoyable, but pales in comparison to the first two movies.","I enjoyed Shrek the Third, but I found a lot of it very disappointing as well. The plot is very contrived, and has been done better many times before. The script, has a number of very bright spots, but is dull in comparison to two very good predecessors. It just goes to show how sequels are nearly always inferior to the original. In fact, the only sequels that surpass their original is Toy Story 2, Home Alone 2 and Garfield 2. There is a very funny scene with Donkey and Puss in Boots having a sort of body swap, and Donkey doing that priceless innocent eye look. But that is pretty much it, though girls may delight in Fiona and all the fairytale princesses having some sort of princess reunion. The animation is mostly well done, and the voice talents are very good indeed, especially Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas. However, the film, which showed a lot of promise, is undermined by a contrived storyline and an uneven script. All in all, enjoyable, but it could have been much better. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox."
212,Shrek the Third,6,2 November 2008,Mediorgre,"Okay, so I'm a big fan of the first two Shrek movies, in fact Shrek 2 was even better than the first one in every manner. I didn't see this movie in theaters since I heard it was mediocre so I didn't bother. I recently saw it on a movie channel and had to agree with the critics. Highly disappointing. Granted it made me laugh multiple times but plot wise, it was considerably flimsy compared to the second one, which I think sets a standard. There is a lack of urgency and dynamism that the second movie had.Things that SHOULD have worked: Artie - I didn't like him or hate him. I felt his past and character where rather weak. They had an opportunity to do an homage to retrieving Fiona from the first movie and help build his character but they ultimately cut any type of bonding short by Merlin zapping them home far too soon. Also, he needed glasses or something else. I was unconvinced that even nerds hated him. Timberlake did an okay job though, I'll give him that.The Princesses - Snow White was a refreshing addition to the cast. Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty were also good but had less of an effect. The whole scene with Snow White summoning animals in her classic Disney voice and then breaking out into Led Zeppelin was perhaps the highlight of the whole movie. They needed more dynamic scenes like that one, that took the classic fairytale/Disney fluff and make it extreme. Otherwise the entire ""break in"" and entire ""girl power"" scene was far less interesting and fell short of the jail break out and later giant cookie siege on the castle in Shrek 2.The Pregnancy - I had always known they were going to have kids, but I disliked that they actually showed the ogre babies in the third one. I considered it gimmicky and I feel they should have left Fiona visibly pregnant at the end. That way they could decide what they could do for the next movie. I had originally thought that would surely, being that the theme of the first two movies was loving others for who they are, not for false appearances, discrimination, etc that Shrek and Fiona's children would have been, as a twist, completely human. That way in the next movie you'd have conflict with children teasing their children that their parents are ogres and thus revisits the whole message of tolerance.There were so many things wrong with it..no storybook opening, no CG ""dance party"" or musical at the end, somewhat of an implied tradition, I mean it was funny, but it felt somewhat forced or even half baked. It could have been split up for online webisodes, not a whole movie. Camera angles weren't as fun, scenes shorter, far more immature jokes, it just felt, again forced. Kids would love it but from a story standpoint it was just mediocre and not as funny or innovative as the others. It's more or less being disappointed with a series that was really witty and to get something not great from the line is...rather disheartening."
213,Shrek the Third,5,6 October 2008,"The ""Shrek"" franchise was going strong with the first two movies, but unfortunately had to take a dip with this one","While this third ""Shrek"" movie from DreamWorks Animation was playing in theatres, I was well aware of it. By that time, I had seen the first two films in the franchise (both more than once, I think), but decided I wouldn't watch this one until I had seen both of its predecessors again. So, having finally done that very recently, after probably not seeing either of them in several years, I watched this second sequel to the 2001 animated hit, but my expectations weren't high, since I knew it was considered far inferior to the first two. After watching it, I think I get the criticism, and why so many fans were disappointed.Shrek's father-in-law, the King of Far, Far Away, is not well, and is eventually found on his deathbed, where he tells Shrek that he is to take his place as King. However, Shrek does not wish to take this position, so just before the King dies, he tells the ogre about another possible heir to the throne, Arthur. So, Shrek sets out with Donkey and Puss In Boots to find this heir to the throne, and just as they're leaving, Fiona tells her husband news that he's not ready to hear...she's pregnant! The three make it to their destination, Worcestershire Academy, where they discover that Arthur (a.k.a. Artie) is a very unpopular student, often picked on by his peers, but it's obviously about to change for him! Meanwhile, Prince Charming is still hoping to become King and have his ""Happily Ever After""! He has managed to round up a bunch of fairy tale villains, who also want their ""Happily Ever After"", so while Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are gone, these villains invade the Kingdom of Far, Far Away and help Prince Charming try and take over! I think my main complaint about this third installment in DreamWorks Animation's ""Shrek"" franchise is the lack of humour. For example, Shrek's nightmare about having babies, with some throwing up involved. For the Worcestershire Academy, they combined medieval life with modern high school stereotypes. Sounds clever, but it didn't turn out to be very funny, I don't know exactly how to explain it. An example is one of the cheerleaders saying, ""Ugh, totally eweth,"" when she sees Shrek, and I feel I could have found that more amusing than I did, I don't know. This movie also features a bunch of fairy tale princesses who unite with Princess Fiona and her mother against Prince Charming and his evil fairy tale allies, and they don't tend to add much to the film. This includes when they talk about babies ""pooping"". Yes, like the first two ""Shrek"" films, you can be sure this one has fart and bowel movement jokes, but this time, they may get worse. I did find an occasional laugh, and probably smiled quite a bit while watching ""Shrek the Third"", but overall, it didn't quite tickle my funny bone enough. Not only does this film lack humour, it also seems to lack excitement compared to its two predecessors, doesn't seem to get quite as heartfelt, and the plot may not be as intriguing.Much of ""Shrek the Third"" is an animated take on the story of King Arthur's beginnings, which reminds me of another film. The film I'm thinking of is the overlooked 1963 Disney production, ""The Sword in the Stone"", which I think is far superior to this film, a major reason being that I definitely found it funnier. That includes the version of Merlin in that film, much funnier than the Merlin here, even though this movie's version of the wizard was voiced by funnyman Eric Idle. Anyway, this second sequel to the 2001 fairy tale spoof from DreamWorks Animation may have been highly anticipated by many fans, but unfortunately, it appears many were let down, and I'm not surprised. A fourth installment in the ""Shrek"" franchise has been confirmed, and I can't just assume right now that it won't be any better than the third, but I'd better not get my hopes up, and don't suggest others do, either."
214,Shrek the Third,4,28 August 2008,A Real Let Down,"When I heard that a third Shrek film was going to be made I was hoping that it would be a good film, considering that the first two were really good films. Unforuately, for adults this film was a real disappointment, and nothing in comparion to the first two.In Shrek the Third, King Harold has become ill and it is left to Shrek and Fiona to rule the kingdom of Far Far Away. When King Harold dies his makes Shrek his successor, despite the fact he doesn't want to be king. However, there is another heir, Arthur (Justin Timberlake), and Shrek, Donkey and Puss-in-Boots, goes in search of the young gentleman. Fiona at the same time tells Shrek that she is pregnant, which leads to Shrek doubting whether he could be a good father. Meanwhile Prince Charming plots to take over Far Far Away whilst Shrek is absent, and he gets all the fairy tale villains he can to assist him.The problem with this film is that it feels more force and dumbed itself down. There are less cultural jobs, and more low-brow jobs. The whole point of Shrek that it was a little smarter and a little more high-brow. It meant that it applied to adults and children. The first two Shrek film will last the test of time, but I think that this film will not be remembered. The parody in this film in this film is not as good, the focus on an American style High-School was not a good move. The creation of Artie was not a good character. There were still a couple of jokes, like Puss-in-Boots and his girlfriends, and Queen Lillian smashing out of prison, but I again, it felt force. Puss-in-Boots was underused, and he was a great character. The film was also more clichéd, and looked for plot devices, such as Donkey and Puss swapping bodies. The animation was still top-notch, and it is not the worst kids film ever made. Kids will still enjoy it, but as I say it's not so good for adults."
215,Shrek the Third,7,22 August 2008,Ogre and out...?,"It took me a while to catch up with the third edition of the money-spinning ""Shrek"" franchise and I was vaguely aware of a less than positive critical, if not popular response, to it but was pleasantly surprised with the product on show. Okay, it's pick-your-cliché from ""the law of diminishing returns"", ""familiarity breeding contempt"" and ""too much of a good thing"", but hey, I still like these characters and whilst I now would doubt whether the characters and situations can be developed any further at least on the big-screen, it's certainly been one of the better trilogies of recent years. The graphics and animations are as before so good as to make you think you're wearing 3D spex and the story, while contrived (I'm not quite sure how Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table actually qualify as classic children's fairy-tale or cartoon favourites) shares the laughs around before winding up at the by now familiar happy-ending finish with a romp-out to a classic track from yesteryear, this time Sly Stone's funk-tastic ""Thank you..."". Best moments are the Gingerbread Man's life flashing before him in a (threatened) pre-death moment and the four Disney princesses (plus one ugly step-sister!) giving it some attitude as they find liberation (even burning a bra symbolically, in the process). Best line, as usual, goes to Eddie Murphy's Donkey ""I'm being attacked by an ogre - with issues!"". There aren't as many outright belly-laughs as in the peerless first ""Shrek"", you feel that Shrek and Fiona are more bit-players in their own movie (I can't believe I'm humanising animated characters!) and occasionally you're made to wait for the next really good joke (Eric Idle's Merlin and Justin Timberlake's Arthur don't exactly leap off the page/screen either), so yes, this outing of the not-so-jolly green giant, may not be as good as its predecessors but that's down to the lack of surprise at revisiting these stock characters and, heck, they were mighty good predecessors!"
216,Shrek the Third,3,27 July 2008,"Unfortunately, there will be more...","This is official: Dreamworks had ran out ideas.When I write this review, I already watched their latest animation feature, Kung Fu Panda. I found Kung Fu Panda fun, while not a Classic. But compared to Shrek The Third, Kung Fu Panda was a Masterpiece!Shrek The Third was not only bad, but it was insulting your intelligence. The pop cultural references was handled with a horrible taste, the jokes were awful and makes you wanna punch the character because it was too stupid. Shrek, who supposed to be an annoying but lovable character, became just very annoying in this movie.The plot - well, if there was one - was Shrek cannot bear the truth that he has to be King of Far Far Away. And there is one prince that could bear the throne. Later we were introduced to Artie - nickname for Arthur, I suppose - whose Fiona cousin. Shrek was trying so hard convincing Artie to take the throne and be a King. Meanwhile when Shrek on the mission, Charming - the outcast prince - try to overthrown Far Far Away.Well, if it was intriguing enough for you to find, I guess you could take a look at a movie. The main story was sooooo predictable and repeatable it was turn up to be boring. It seems from Shrek, Shrek 2 and now Shrek The Third, Shrek was nothing but the ugly Ogre that have nothing to do. He couldn't handle any responsibilities! If in the first Shrek you feel a slight of hope that this ugly ogre could make his way with Fiona. In Shrek 2, it kinda annoying but we could at least care for the relationship between Shrek and Fiona. In Shrek The Third, it just that you wish they are dead so the series can stop.Really, this movie was a big disappointment. And what makes me more sad, that this movie scores big in USA. Really, guys? Shrek the Third? If you're not more selective than this kind of junk will always makes it's way to your theater. Do you want it to happened? I heard Dreamworks already making the forth and fifth movie. And if people still come to that, I guarantee they will make Shrek until tenth...Just avoid this kind of junk. Give them a lesson to respect us as a viewer next time3/10"
217,Shrek the Third,4,27 July 2008,Shrek-chedly Awful,"Within the first few minutes you get several episodes of retching, butt scratching, spitting and otherwise disgusting stuff. Apart from making it questionable for kids it sets the tone for the movie. Not appealing. To be fair, you are warned about it with lines like ""This stinks.""The animation is still outstanding, especially for the humans and scenery. But it has the fatal flaw of being BORING. There is none of the cutting edge humor from the first two. a transvestite stepsister is sick but funny. Once. Repeated, it's just sick. So let's hope that this is the last and we won't be disappointed with Shrek Bore. I mean four. They've already done the boring one."
218,Shrek the Third,8,22 June 2008,Mostly enjoyable,"Just caught it on HBO. I was a fan of the first two movies but never found time to see this one in the theater. I have to say it was a lot more fun than the average poster seems to say...but maybe watching it at home is different.I'm surprised no poster has mentioned the gingerbread man's life flashing before his eyes, complete with bionic legs. That made me laugh out loud. There are other moments to cherish, including a pair of geeks at the high school, the dronkeys playing with their dad, and above all the Disney heroines morphing from their long-suffering roles as passive victims into a bra-burning assault squadron. There's enough subtext rolling by to make this film well worth the time."
219,Shrek the Third,4,2 June 2008,Third Shrek running out of ideas,"I didn't think this movie was that good. I really didn't think the second sequel was that good either. The problem with Shrek is it's a one trick pony. The first movie was great because it was fresh and original. Now, all the sequels do is repeat the same formula and it's just not that funny any more. What little plot there is concerns Shrek going to find Arthur who can take the place of the dead King because Shrek doesn't want to. Prince Charming wants to take over Far Far Away so gets the villains from various fairy tales to help him. The drama is can Charming be stopped and will Arthur want to take over.Also, even Donkey doesn't have any great lines any more. This should be the last one, but I see a fourth sequel is in the works. I am glad I didn't pay to see this but as long as people keep taking their kids to the theater to see these sequels, I guess they'll keep making them.FINAL VERDICT: It has a short running time, but still not worth spending a little over an hour to watch."
220,Shrek the Third,2,30 March 2008,The fairytale has faded...,"I am a Shrek fan as most of us are and I was looking forward to this film a lot. I entered the cinemas happy and delighted but I fell asleep during the film and as I walked out of the cinema, my face was horrible. I wasted my money on a supposed-to-be-good film which it isn't.The characters were very enjoyable as always except for Prince Artie, he was annoying and depressing, he was a big disappointed. The plot was fairly stupid and could have been much better. The whole film has totally faded and it has become a stupid 3D film with no laughter. A very big disappointment.2/10: The reason for the two is the performances by Myers, Diaz, Murphy, Banderas, Andrews and Cleese."
221,Shrek the Third,6,19 February 2008,This series has run dry,"Who would have thought that Shrek could have somehow made it to three movies? Well, besides the executives who know that a Shrek movie could make them a lot of money, of course.Well, they shouldn't have. This third Shrek film does not have the fun of the previous two. A rating of '6' may be a little high, but only because I choose to keep the funny and entertaining parts in my head more than the parts that were straight-up boring.Shrek is no longer funny, Fiona is no longer funny, Puss-in-Boots is now just plain annoying, and Donkey is barely funny. The gingerbread man has definitely seen better days in the form of Shrek 2. Prince Charming is still his kind-of-appealing but mostly not self, who wants to band the villains of fairy-tale stories together against the fairy-tale heroes to change the course of time.One highlight of the movie was the introduction of another fairy tale character, Merlin, who is actually more a character from medieval legend, but still. Work with me here.Overall, this movie was not worth going to see in theatres, and is not worth buying. Maybe spend three bucks or less to rent it."
222,Shrek the Third,4,21 January 2008,Poor screen writing ruined this film.,"Alright, there were several problems with this film, which is why it didn't do well with the critics. The first problem is that there are too many slapstick and poop jokes. The first Shreks used similes and odd situations to be funny. This time, the writers tried to appeal to their children audience, but by doing so, alienated their adult one. Another problem is the plot structure inconsistency with the first films. In the first two, Shrek was always the underdog with the most obstacles to overcome. In this film, Shrek almost has a villain's advantage over Charming. Charming has to gain the trust of the Fairy Tale rejects, take over a castle, and declare himself king. Had Shrek been in his place, the film would have been in agreement with the first two. Finally, this film left out the ""journey"" feature the first two had. What I mean is that, in the first two, Shrek had a long journey to accomplish his goals, but this film was just connected, episodic misadventures. If Merlin hadn't just warped them home, the movie would have been more enjoyable because we could have identified with Shrek's hardships.""Shrek the Third"" is by no means a bad film, but compared to its predecessors, it is inferior. I cannot recommend it to anyone over the age of 12 due to the poor plot, inconsistent characters, and the immature jokes and situations."
223,Shrek the Third,4,14 January 2008,NOT a happy ending for the franchise.,"Shrek and Shrek 2 are classics of CGI movie-making, brimming with charm, great jokes and visual excellence; Shrek The Third, on the other hand, is as stagnant as the swamp that the titular ogre calls home, reeking of lazy writing and stinking up the place with stale jokes.When the king of Far, Far, Away finally croaks (he's a frog.... geddit?), Princess Fiona and Shrek are expected to take his place on the throne. But Shrek, being the miserable git that he is, doesn't want the responsibility, and so he sets sail (along with Donkey and Puss-in-Boots) in search of the only other heira young student named Arthur Pendragon.Meanwhile, a miffed Prince Charming, who feels that he should rightfully be king, plots to take the title by force.I had been warned that the third instalment in the Shrek series wasn't on a par with its predecessors, but decided to watch it anyway, reasoning that even a bad Shrek movie would be better than most contemporary kids movies. Unfortunately, it seems that I was fooling myself.With a mediocre plot overloaded with poorly developed characters, and a practically laugh-free script, Shrek The Third is a pitiful effort that should never have been made. When a film's funniest momentthe repeated last gasps of the frog kingis not only very predictable, but also extremely familiar (I just can't put my finger on where I've seen this beforeit'll come to me... eventually), then it's time to give up. The fairytale is well and truly over."
224,Shrek the Third,3,6 November 2007,Disappointing,"The first one was fresh and fun. The second was hysterical. The third was . . . blah.I went to the theaters with moderate expectations, and I got less than I thought I would. The movie had a ""how-many-times-can-we-use-this-gag"" feeling to it. It tried to use jokes from the other movies that just weren't funny anymore. This movie is proof that there can be too much of a good thing.Yes, the animation is spectacular, but that doesn't mean much if there's no soul in the story or script. I sat in my seat the whole time waiting for something that would give me a good laugh, and it never really came. There were a number of chuckles, but aside from that the movie felt tired. Nothing seemed to give that same pain-in-your-ribs laughter that the other films delivered.The voice actors weren't bad, it was more the script that killed it. There were moments when there seemed to be build up for a good laugh, but it all seemed to deflate before it really happened.I left the theater feeling even more disappointed than I think I ever have been when it comes to movies. At the end everyone seemed to sit there in there seats watching the credits roll by thinking ""it's over? Already?"" If you want to watch a good movie . . . don't rent this one."
225,Shrek the Third,5,6 August 2007,what happened to Shrek's skills ?  Snow White rules !,"This was really nothing ı expected of. The first two were outstanding, entertaining, full of action surprises that are satisfying as this is not a drama animation. But this last one. I mean what happened to friend Shrek ? He knows how to fight. He is not like friend Obelix who uses brutal power to defeat bad guys. He can fight with his own skills in American Wrestling (as Americans say) or Pankratio (as we say) better than Sting, Rock etc.. And no friendly arguments with The Donkey, they more likely support each other in another calm grown up way.Both Donkey and Puss are pushed unnecessarily to one corner and; Arthur and Prince Charming are the ones leading the supporting act. Kinda disappointing though.But to give the Sezar, Sezar's due, Snow White is beautifully characterized in sense of realization. She really keeps the movie going when the story chokes up and does A GREAT PERFORMANCE in the scene she defeats Living Tree Gate Guards. Takes the song from older Disney shots and successfully transforms it to rock sound of our time. Congratulations to the writers.All in all the movie gives the hidden message of being the last of the series, as it tries to make the characters settle down in one home, which we usually see in movies, trying to cure the lack of family sense in the west world."
226,Shrek the Third,7,21 July 2007,not as bad as they say :),"i saw this movie last evening and i was not disappointed :)I thought this movie was funny and still keep the great ""shrek"" humor. But the story in this movie was maybe not as great as in the first two. And the movie is so fussy and prepare that it was amazing. You could see a pore on skin. And there was one chapter in the movie there i was choking in the seat of laughter. But still a great movie but i'm not saying that they should make another film, rather that. Shrek 3 is nearly as good as Shrek 2.And there were lot of a new persons and that was good :)But i was pleased this movie is good."
227,Shrek the Third,9,14 July 2007,Good Movie and a Really great Message....,"Hmm...I know quite a few here have not liked this movie when compared to Shrek and Shrek 2, but let me tell you every Shrek movie is great on its own and should not be compared! Each movie has a beautiful message at the end..and this one I think tops them all...Believe in yourself...The movie is really good with some really good laughs..like the scene where Prince Charming asks the ""puppet"" "" Where is Shrek ? "".... I am still trying to figure what was said! Anyways, please go and see this movie if you are a Shrek fan...and if not you will become one....."
228,Shrek the Third,7,12 July 2007,Undeserving of such censure...,"OK so it's not as laugh-aloud as the previous two, but that's because the Shrek franchise has grown up. There are some silly moments just to get laughs (and yes, they do bring up the word ""poop"" more than enough times just to get kids laughing) but I still enjoyed this movie - and I'm 23.I think that adults will possibly enjoy this more than the kids - some of the gags are more subtle, or too adult for littler children to understand. For example the horn ""bleeping"" out certain words, or Artie's fake temper tantrum (funny for adults, kids won't get the joke as it's probably something they do themselves).That in NO way makes this a bad, boring or tired movie. I just think you have to watch this film expecting something different that appeals to a more adult point of view. Unfortunately if you go into this expecting in-your-face, obvious, don't-have-to-think-about-it laughs like the kids will, you are probably going to be disappointed. But DO give this film a go - you will be pleasantly surprised."
229,Shrek the Third,7,8 July 2007,3rd Times a Charm - or is it?,"A few years ago we got Shrek - the anti fairy tale hero and a movie that made fun of the fairy tales and concepts that Disney has spewed out over the years and as a result we got a fresh, fun and quirky children's film which had some great adult humour too. A sequel followed and who didn't fall in love with Puss in Boots? 2007 is the year of the trilogy and after the letdown of SM3 and POTC3 it is now Shreks turn to attempt an adequate 3rd helping.Did it succeed? - I just don't know. Not exactly a committed statement from someone who is attempting to review the movie, but I cant figure out if it was good or as good as its predecessors.The cast were all back and the voices all great as usual - no real qualms there.The plot - The King dies (in a very funny scene!) and leaves Shrek the new King unless he can persuade a young Arthur, a relative of the Kings to take the throne. Whilst Shrek is off on his quest to persuade Artie to become the new King of Far Far Away Charming enlists the help of the villains and losers of fairytale lore and invades the Kingdom determined that they, for a change, should be the ones to have a happy ending - and to put the icing on the cake - Fiona is pregnant! As usual Pinocchio, Gingy, The Three Pigs and the Wolf are all back to help and are as amusing as they have ever been.There are some very amusing scenes with Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, who in all honesty were much much funnier than Donkey and Puss. More screen time with them would've been greatly appreciated. I hated Snow White when I was a kid but after seeing her turn all bad ass and sing the Immigrant Song I have changed my opinion.Artie also had some fun scenes - the overacting scene was very funny!! It was actually Prince Charming who stole the whole show with his very evil, yet also very camp plan to kill Shrek during a play he and the other villains were performing. It was all a bit odd but still amusing non the less.I felt that Donkey and Puss were a little underused and that the inevitable body swapping storey arc was thrown in at the last minute. It wasn't that funny, or to be honest necessary.I thought that there were less fart and poop jokes than usual but they were saved until the end of the movie for Shrek and Donkeys kids and lets not forget Shreks ""poop speech"" This brought a huge wave of silence as those types of jokes stopped being funny a long time ago - and I went to a Sunday afternoon matinée! I did laugh at parts though and there were some genuinely funny and clever scenes don't get me wrong but it just felt that something was missing.As usual the soundtrack was fun with some good songs on there - not overly convinced by Fergies version of Barracuda but that's a minor issue.Overall I would give it 7/10. It loses a point automatically for being a sequel (personal rule), losses another for the under use of Fiona, Puss and Donkey and a final point for the very unfunny body swapping idea.Kids will love it of course, but the magic and spark that attracted adults attention in the first one has definitely gone. It will make millions at the box office and even more in toy and game sales but lets have Shrek end on a reasonable high. It wasn't as much of a let down as some the threequels we have had this year but the franchise has all but run out of steam. Lets just have the Puss in Boots spin off to create some freshness to a very good franchise ."
230,Shrek the Third,3,4 July 2007,Shrek ....... the lost plot!,"What on earth happened to Shrek? Having waited for months for the new film to be released, my experience last night watching it at the cinema was such a let down! The banal, nay, non-existent plot started some 10 minutes after the only interesting scenes in the film. Did the opening writers/directors die after this opening and were replaced by automatons working on the basis that Shrek fans would come to watch any old rubbish and still applaud? What might have saved the film from complete boredom would have been the music which in the previous films has been terrific and could have stood alone. But what did we get? Two decent pieces of music and zilch else! Who could forget the terrific songs from Shrek 1 & 2 but 3 .... forget it!! Have the producers of the Shrek series become totally complacent, are they lying back counting their millions content to offer this rubbish to the cinema-going public and unashamedly take our money? If Shrek 4, now in production, is going to redeem this film then the paying public needs to tell the film makers that they got this one badly wrong, and they need to sack the writers and directors of this ""turkey"" and get back to the format that made 1 & 2 such a success"
231,Shrek the Third,3,1 July 2007,Had higher hopes for this one....,"Compared to part one and part two, the third movie really stank. Shrek was pretty good and pretty funny. Part two was just Great! Lots of music and I cant get my son to stop watching it. Than going to see part three I expected it to be even better but it FLOPPED! There was hardly any music sections, they took out key characters.Throughout the whole movie I was waiting to see if fairy god mother was going to return. Prince charming and the mother were very funny and added more action. They killed off the father and totally made it very unappealing. I know you need humor but not about someones death.Donkey was not doing much talking and he is the funniest character of ALL! Also Pinocchio and the gang should have been more active in the show because they do add more humor.There was a lot of music missing and why did they throw in a wacky wizard. How funny is that going to be to a bunch of school ages children? Not much, my son asked me to leave in the middle of the movie because he did not like it.The movie makers should have made it more like part two with the singing, humor for children to understand and with adult humor that part two was full of.If they are setting this movie up to be a series than they did a poor job. Personally this movie sucked."
232,Shrek the Third,4,29 June 2007,An animation movie for kids - Adults better look trailer only,"I was always a very big shrek fan and I was really looking forward to see the third movie in the theater. The Belgian critics already warned that this third movie is not like its predecessors, and I went to the theater with no expectations. I was really disappointed when after half an hour watching I was already bored like hell. Many people will not want to believe that it is possible to ruin such a successful movie series which had so many great characters in the two previous ones. Seems dreamworks is thinking more about money and franchising than about entertaining the audience with the double sensed good humor they always used. Instead of giving more of the characters like puss and donkey, they added up a bunch of characters with no personality It was shocking to see that the funny moments of the trailer almost all showed up in the first seven minutes of the movie. The moment shrek and his bunch go to search for Artie the movie starts to be really boring with in between (very) few moments with the good old humor that made 1 and 2 very amusing.Dreamworks had so many potential with the new fairytale characters but instead of working out a few of them and to make a strong movie, they overwhelm us with every character you ever heard of in a fairytale in such a fast time that you are not even realizing who is all in it.The new main character of Artie is just sad and boring. They didn't even did the effort to make him a bit funny and you will only see him giving stupid moral speeches, having a father son moment or playing a drama actor. Add the whole high school language humor and an annoying prince charming musical which together make the movie so dull that the moments with donkey and puss can't rescue the movie anymore. Luckely these two characters where in it or the movie would be rated 1/10 by me.With the situation at the end (triplet shreks) I am curious how dreamworks is going to make a fourth movie. I really hope they learn from there mistakes and restore the good old humor in the fourth one.Anyhow this is just an adult opinion, there were kids in the audience and they seemed to like it a lot."
233,Shrek the Third,6,26 June 2007,"i have to say, i was a bit disappointed","As i loved Shrek 1 and 2. I felt that this had no real funny parts. after rolling on the floor for the first two i only had a few laugh out loud moments. and i'm sorry but when the queen battered through the wall with her head i was just like ?where did that come from? but on the plus side, donkey and dragon babies were very cute! and Justin Timberlake did better than i thought he would- although he did have one of those long preachy cant we all just get along speeches. I also liked the idea of using all the story princesses as a kind of Charlie's angels (appropriate)Definitely not a rubbish film, but maybe they should of stuck at 2?"
234,Shrek the Third,5,24 June 2007,Hardly Magic,"In 2004, three years after Shrek graced out screen, we were given its sequel, Shrek 2. Now this movie split audiences down the centre, some people loved it, others hated it and decided they no longer liked Shrek whatsoever. Others, like me admittedly, preferred Shrek 2 and found it be even funnier. The introduction of Puss in Boots was especially a nice touch and brought in even more pop culture references and a great villain in the form of the Fairy Godmother. So naturally I was pretty excited about Shrek the Third originally, then the trailers arrived. My initial reaction to the trailers was sheer horror, not only had I not laughed once in it, but also I was left feeling like I'd seen it all before in Shrek 2. It lacked originality, and that in itself horrified me. So I approached Shrek the Third with some caution, trying to prepare myself for a disappointment. And unfortunately that's exactly what Shrek the Third is, a disappointment. A well made, gorgeous looking and occasionally funny disappointment. Its certainly not the worst animated movie I have ever seen, but its hardly up to the standard of the original. I suppose my biggest moan with the movie is it never seems that funny, it has the occasional funny moment in it, and a lot of the movie has potential, but it never reaches this potential. It seems to be almost holding back, a lot of people complained about the pop culture references in the second part, but come on I'd like something a bit more than what we get here.Well lets start off with the characters and cast then. Mike Myers is as good as he can be in the role as Shrek, admittedly this was the first movie I truly appreciated the character. Shrek has always seemed bland to me, but likable. Here I felt he had his moments, and since he really is the main focus of the storyline here, and not really so much the supporting characters, I felt that this was more Shrek's journey. This is a good thing for the movie as it gave us time to appreciate how good the character actually is, albeit still being a bit unfunny at times. Cameron Diaz does her usual routine as Fiona, this isn't bad at all, and she has her moments, especially a well written Baby Shower sequence with Snow White, Cinderella etc. Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas however seem to have been given the short straw in this movie. They're the best things in Shrek 2, so naturally you'd assume the director would shove them in our face as often as possible. No, instead the director sidelines them and gives them nothing to do, a shame as they show flashes of brilliance, yet they're not in it enough for us to notice it. This is the movies ultimate flaw, as audiences go mostly to see the pair, even their obligatory dance routine seems half hearted with them. The supporting cast are all brilliant again, in fact a lot of the supporting cast are the best. John Cleese makes the most of his limited screen time, Eric Idle is an ingenious addition to the cast as the eccentric Merlin, and surprisingly Justin Timberlake actually works as Arthur, despite him not being very funny.The comedy of the movie is where its flaws are most prominent. The movie starts off on a high note, in fact for the first half hour I was quite a happy person indeed. The frog kings last croak is absolutely hilarious and undoubtedly the best thing in the movie, the funeral that flows is almost as funny, especially to the accompaniment of a frog choir singing ""Live and Let Die."" Then the movie sort of flounders when we reach Arthur's high school. Of course meeting Lancelot and Guinevere is a nice touch, and gives us some smiles. But popular girls speaking in an old language in their usual uncaring tone just doesn't work at all. Matters aren't helped as that scene sort of drags on and on. The scenes back in Far Far Away are much better as it shows some great characters with more screen time. I appreciated the villains in this movie, they had some pretty good moments, especially the trees near the end, that got a big laugh out of the audience. The movie just sort of filters out by the overly-sentimental ending. Its humour is always in the background, but never reaches its pinnacle like the others did. I enjoyed the movie, but can't say I loved it like the other two.The animation on the other hand is beautiful, absolutely beautiful. The landscapes are very well done and are thing of beauty to behold, the characters look realistic now, and at times you actually forget you're watching a cartoon! The storyline here as well is actually a bit better than Shrek 2's. I liked the storyline here and motives here a lot more, I also found the moral to be just that tiniest bit better than Shrek 2's. In fact this movie had the potential to be a bit better than the previous two, it just loses out with a lack of humour and by wasting the two best characters! Also the loss of the Fairy Godmother is noticeable.Overall Shrek the Third will please the kids, and huge fans of the series will lap it up. But its definitely a flawed movie with so much unfulfilled potential. I'd recommend seeing it, and perhaps a second viewing might be required to get the most out of it. But at the moment its just another sequel this summer that disappoints. Not quite as awful as Spiderman 3, at least I was never bored here, but its still a far cry short of the Summers greats such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Ocean's Thirteen."
235,Shrek the Third,2,18 June 2007,Not Half As Good As Shrek 1 and 2,"shrek 1 and 2 were my favorite shrek movies, shrek the third was not that good, not much adventure in it, i thought it would be a really great movie but instead wasn't half as good as shrek 1 and 2, i was really looking forward to it as well, the new characters in the movie were really great and all but again needed more adventure to the movie, thats the reason why i watch the shrek movies too is because of the great adventures thats in the movies and the great characters and because mike meyer and cameron diaz are one of my favorite actors. But i must admit the rest of the movie was OK, i laughed at some parts, but yeah"
236,Shrek the Third,7,18 June 2007,Where is that Shrek?????,"I saw Shrek the third yesterday will a full cinema in the father's day in Mexico city. I was very exciting about this film because the others two are great. First with the cinema full is very hard to find ticket and also to find a parking lot but well is Shrek 3 i was thinking.Finally i saw it and well what the F*ck? Where is that Shrek of the first film, yes the ogre, the arrogant, the malice, the one that live always angry in his marsh and the one that do anything just for his own interests. Also in the second film is that Shrek, a little less but still the film is very good.Other thing that i don't like is the short during of the film, only like 1 hour and 20 minutes.I put 7/10 just because the puss in the boots and the donkey, yes this characters are still strong and with great gags.......the puss in the boots is maybe the best character of the second and definitely of the third. Othe good aspect is that Antonio Banderas put his voice into the original version and into the Mexican version because the voices in the Mexican version are just crap. Finally i have to say that in the next film please put the original director back for the good of the film and for the good of the director because he do a crap film: Narnia.Well better don't do Shrek 4 because now Shrek is Father!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
237,Shrek the Third,6,15 June 2007,It's fun but it's very far away of the first two films.Disappointing,"In 2001,the film Shrek surprised kids and adults(I'm included in the adults' list) with a great animation,its subversive humor and its constant and brilliant jeer to the clichés of the fairy-tales.By my point of view,the film was brilliant.In 2004,the sequel of that film came and it managed to do something difficult:being very near to the level of quality from the first part.I had a lot of expectations with Shrek the Third,but the film really disappointed me.It is fun but it lost the charm and a big part of the humor the first two films have.The weakest point of Shrek the Third is the screenplay which is predictable and too obvious.The movie is always near to loose the control because of the absence of cohesion in the script.The humor makes the movie better,but I could not find the humor I found in the first two films.Some jokes did not make me laugh and the other part of them made me laugh,but it's a predictable humor.But the film has some good elements:like I said before,it's fun and the chemistry between Shrek,Donkey and Puss in Boots is very good.Also,Fiona's friends are a good addition to the story.The animation is spectacular.The images are very realistic and it's easy to note there was a hard work in here.Shrek the Third is fun and funny...but it's very far away of the first two films.And,because of that,I'm disappointed with this movie."
238,Shrek the Third,,14 June 2007,shrek the third soundtrack,"Who can help me with the title of the song /name of the artist(s) which plays in the moment when Shrek gets arrested by Prince Charming's guards(1h.02 min of the movie) :) 1000000x A very enjoyable collection of tunes are assembled for this third Shrek film. The standout track has to be ""Immigrant Song"" by the mighty Led Zeppelin. For a band whose popularity, influence, and record sales are matched only by The Beatles, Led Zeppelin rarely allow their music to be used commercially. I'm very pleased that in this case they did. As for the rest of the disc, there's not a single clunker to be found in this eclectic group. I love both prior Shrek soundtracks, but this one is superior."
239,Shrek the Third,8,14 June 2007,Pretty good!,"I liked it, though I did not think it was as funny as Shrek 2. The plot is great, especially the quest to find Arthur and Fiona's pregnancy! Yay! Ogre babies! Anything with Puss in Boots and Donkey in is great. I loved how the plots were played out and I think that the creators are still as good as always at hiding subtle jokes throughout the movie. Seeing it in the theater is really the best way to see it so if you can, go see it! We went to go see it as a beginning of summer celebration. My mom was wondering, ""Will there be any more Shreks?"" I don't know that, but I'm hoping that maybe they will be more. But if there are more, I hope they get better as they go along. I definitely think that was the case in the Lord of The Rings trilogy, the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and the Harry Potter movies. (At least that's my opinion.)What do you think? Well, I just wanted to say I really enjoyed Shrek the Third."
240,Shrek the Third,9,11 June 2007,Brilliant stuff,"When the King of Far Far Away is about to die it becomes clear that an heir to the throne must be found. Shrek and Fiona are in Far Far Away but Shrek doesn't feel much for the throne. So, the search is on for another heir.Shrek The Third picks up where Shrek 2 left of. Everyone is back in action and ready to roll from the first minute. And that's why this film works out so well - all players are right in their places in their specific roles and there is more than enough of a story to tell to keep things going for the full length of the film. Add to that the animations for this one that are a lot better than the ones used in the first film and it can't be much of a surprise that this third part is better than the first part and better than the second part.For the rest it brings just what is to be expected: a lot of dark and cynical views on fairy tales and a good lot of one like jokes that are somehow connected by the mad adventures to the many figures that run around through the film. So, all in all, a very worthy third party to the series. Looking forward to part IV.9 out of 10 Ogre Kings"
241,Shrek the Third,4,10 June 2007,"Shrek 3 ""little bit yucky, but a bit good"" words of my 4 yr old","My 4 yr old sons words and review of this movie are as follows:""The frog died, and because the yucky man was trying to kill Shrek. And the pigs were trying to fight the yucky guy which was really funny.""Now I watched this movie with my children and to be honest they weren't that impressed they preferred to watch Shrek 2, go figure. I myself was of the same mind as my children, wasn't bad and wasn't great sort of hanging out in the middle there.What I wasn't impressed with however is this movies blatant use of sexual innuendo, passed off as jokes and gags. What demographic are the writers aiming at, there are a few areas in the movie where i was just thinking ""What The?"""
242,Shrek the Third,4,6 June 2007,Skippadoodle,"This film was made for no other reason than commerce and a guaranteed payday for everyone involved. Considering the content emotional state of its protagonists there was little place to take both the story and its passe post-modern ironic jabs at pop and Disney culture. Murphy's voice is only an exploited extension of his hilarious work as the Klump family in 'The Nutty Professor.' Banderas's charm as 'Puss' is negated by monotonous character jokes as well as a poor second-act twist that makes the film increasingly grating. The plot hinges on 'Arthur' and Timberlake imbues him with a whiny, effete personality that is less than winning. He also appears incapable of reciting his dialogue with any double-entendres or meanings as everything sounds like he's reading from a kids book to a five year old audience. The film's saving grace continues to be the wonders that the film's limitless budget can provide to an expressive animated universe. There's no real urgent ambition here, just an opportunity for viewers to reconnect with old ""friends."""
243,Shrek the Third,7,4 June 2007,Movie Review: Shrek the Third,"Gone is the evil fairy godmother, vanished after being blasted by the magic from her own wand in Shrek 2 and so her son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) took over as the core villain. Prince Charming is reduced to a mediocre stage actor who gets booed at every opportunity by his audience. Feeling the victim of the doings by Shrek (Mike Myers), Prince Charming vows to take back what he thought should be rightly his.Meanwhile in the kingdom of FAR FAR AWAY, The King (John Cleese) is dying and he needs an heir to the throne. Who is to be the heir? It's Shrek of course. But he doesn't want to be king and seeks out to find Princess Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) cousin, Artie (Justin Timberlake) to take his place.Shrek the Third is about who gets to be King of FAR FAR AWAY. Is it Shrek, Artie or Prince Charming? While that is the main plot of the computer-animated film, the story really is about personal identity, parenthood and the relationship between father and son.There is nothing in the form of spectacular in the film. We're all very accustomed to what computer-animated graphics can do. I can't tell the difference to whether the green ogre has one or two pixels more from the first two films. That is besides the point to a family oriented, fun filled movie with jokes and pop music to groove with. It can be 2D for all I care.What is to be appreciated is quite literally not to look at things at face value. That is to put in other words not to judge a book (or ogre) by its cover. It's cliché but still it's not taken seriously often enough. Granted it is taken for too many a times. That is why in the first place DreamWorks came out with an ogre in the form of Shrek. He still looks green as usual.One might argue that Shrek the Third is no greener than its first two films. I won't dispute that fact. We still see the same lovable characters such as Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and the film obviously have stuck itself to a formula that works. Shrek 4 (2010) is on its way to put a ""happily ever after"" to this non-conventional fairy tale.You don't need to see Shrek or Shrek 2 to enjoy Shrek 3. It's as simple to watch as reading a children's storybook. It brings back memories. It relates to teenagers. It gives the children the joy of laughter. It brings family closer. It's a happy film.Those who should leave the cinema with a grimace on their face probably have issues unresolved. It's like looking into the magic mirror and asking who is the fairest of them all. It's not all about seen it and done that. It's about who hasn't. Children are one of those who haven't, while parents have. That is the message if you can relate and apply.The magic and wonders of a computer-animated film by DreamWorks is on show. What it needs now is to end well with a good Shrek 4 and than tell us all about a new story.""Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)"", the soundtrack from the ending credits summarizes Shrek the Third fittingly in err Can you make out what those words in brackets mean?"
244,Shrek the Third,8,3 June 2007,Very Funny Sequel!,"I liked Shrek the Third. Very good, funny, witty film with many good jokes, excellent humor, great music and outstanding video graphics. Greeat animation, as well. What is the most outstanding here, is that the cartoon became more serious in tone, more deep in sense, the topics of child raising, responsibility, care and love are introduced here better, in more vivid colors. Shrek is as usual - clumsy, cool, rude and funny, but the main plus here is the hilarious bunch of female heroes - Snow White, Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella - they are so funny, so cute and so superb that almost steal the show. And when Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song came out, I was roaring with laughter, it is so great! The movie is a real must see."
245,Shrek the Third,4,3 June 2007,Rather disappointing third installment of the still brilliant trilogy,"Going to see Shrek the Third I had already read the lukewarm reviews. I knew that it likely wasn't going to be as good as the first two but it would have at least 10-20 humorous lines. Little did I know it would be about 1-5 humorous lines. I have never seen anything more disappointing.The film starts out fine with a rather funny scene with Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) doing Dinner Theatre with all of Shreks friends (Gingerbread Man, Three Little Pigs, Three Blind Mice, etc.) booing and criticizing him. Then there is a long, long, LONG stretch of unfunny lines. Starting with Charming going to a bar and drafting the villains from other Fairy Tales into an evil plan. Then Shrek and Fiona enter the fold. They are next in line for the throne then there is the second funny scene when King Harold dies. That is funny for a while. Then Shrek, who doesn't want the throne, goes to find a teenager named Arthur. Then comes funny scene Number Three when Fiona tries to tell Shrek she is pregnant but is constantly interrupted by a horn. Then there is a LONG unfunny high school sequence. Terrible. In fact the subplot in Far, Far, Away getting taken over by Charming isn't funny either.Then comes MERLIN (Eric Idle), I will just tell you this isn't funny. In fact this is even more unfunny than the High School scene.Blah, blah, blah. Shrek comes back. Gets captured by Charming. Jokes with charming with unfunny jokes. It was so bad I don't even remember what happens to Charming, all I know is Shrek and Fiona have about 20 cute children.Here are more problems. Puss and Donkey switching bodies is horribly unfunny. In fact they are the two worst characters in the whole thing. Anybody could have written a better script. I could have written a better script. My sister could have written a funnier speech.To quote Justin Timberlake: ""I want my MoneyBack."""
246,Shrek the Third,4,1 June 2007,Commercial says it all,"This movie is a dog. It's not even fun, and creatively lacking. You might as well call it ""Shrek 3: give us your money"" And lucky for us, they are making 4 and 5, but ""no more"" than that. Hooray!The most recent TV commercial consists of this original material: --uncontrolled projectile vomit from a baby ogre --ogre burping (or maybe it was donkey burping) --dragon burping fire that lights a fart into a flame thrower simulated --excrement from a gingerbread manThat is how they are selling this film, with no other reasons to see it. That is what Dreamworks has decided is compelling. That is what they think was so great about the first Shrek. After all, if they didn't think that, they would have emulated the good parts of Shrek 1, not the scatological parts.And what does that tell you about the quality? ;)"
247,Shrek the Third,3,28 May 2007,Third Time Not the Charm,"Of the three Shrek films, they appear to go from good to bad in their order of appearance. This was clearly the lamest, and hopefully last of the lot if the writing continues in this vein.Plot was the tired ""Oh, I'm not cut out for this, I'm not good enough, but I need to learn I really am the hard way."" Gah! Right out of Saturday morning cartoons. Donkey is actually getting annoying too, at some point I was hoping he would go off on his own and take those ridiculous offspring which only a marketer could have dreamed up. (Exactly how do a donkey and a dragon, you know... ?) The morals of the story are rather ham-handed as an ogre and make the time seem to drag. Arthur's shallow highschool chums, good grief, could we try something original? Arthur has to believe in himself, too. Yawn.The music, desperately missing Smashmouth, it was a grab-bag of old pop hits, including a ill-considered ""Live and let die"" which only brings to mind James Bond. I genuinely felt the original writing team left and someone was pulled in to tie it together to meet a production schedule. It should have been shelved until the producers could come up with something as good as the first or second films."
248,Shrek the Third,4,27 May 2007,It's official: Mike Myers isn't funny.,"The difference between the pretend laughter we dredge up at our corny uncle's bad jokes and the forced laughter of several thousand CGI characters is that our uncle isn't being paid millions of dollars to not be funny. ""Do they come in women's sizes?"" Does that qualify as a joke that wouldn't be heard in dinner theatre? The songs they use in this one don't even make any sense: ""Live and Let Die"" at a funeral? It's a James Bond song that Guns 'n Roses covered, it isn't a freaking funeral dirge, to me it's more about maybe an idealistic character who, when presumed to be soft, kicks your @$$. Not for a tearjerking funeral. And, yeah, what is with the extra ""in"" anyway? They could just stretch out ""World"" and make it ""world which we live in."" Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy have some funny moments, and there are a few good sight gags, but it's sunk from the lack of a charismatic lead. Myers is on such auto-pilot that you can hear him cracking himself up at times, not realizing that he isn't being funny. The problem maybe stems from something he said while he was on that ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" lovefest: he doesn't think there's a difference between a fart joke and sophisticated humour (and justifies it by saying that Shakespeare did both). Well, Mike, they aren't the same. They can both have their place in the same work and one can bring relief from another, but that's no reason to just settle for the fart joke because it's easier, you're lazy, and they're the same thing, they're not. I think that Myers lost all his talent between Austin Powers 2 and 3, there was still some there in 2 but by the time he threw a 3 minute Pepsi commercial into the 3rd one it was all gone. Then when everyone saw him with Kanye West and then heard he's going to play Keith Moon (who died at 32 and Myers is now 44) we all had to remind ourselves he ever had any talent at all. Well this isn't going to contravene that impression.Anyway, the movie is a hunk 'o junk because of the lack of effort put into it. Myers should stop doing ""movies"" and go into commercials full time. He turned a character that was likable for being genuinely unlikeable and edgy and turned it into an inoffensive, unfunny shiller of happy meals. Otherwise known as a Canadian."
249,Shrek the Third,4,27 May 2007,"More clever than funny, this movie is almost devoid of laughs despite some game tries by the cast","Shrek's father in-law dies and Shrek and Fiona are next in line.. Shrek, having been standing in for the king knows this is not the life for him so he goes off to find Artie, a kid also in line for the throne.If you've seen anything on this you've probably seen most of what passes for the jokes. This is not a funny movie, It is well plotted, but seemingly devoid of any laugh out loud humor. I sat there for the entire running time straight faced. I can admire the animation, I can admire the cleverness of ""the jokes"" and I can admire the too many ""in"" references, but I can't find it funny. (well thats not true, the Shrek baby stuff at the end is funny) If you want what I think is the perfect example of whats wrong with the film take the funeral for the king. The king has died and we hear Paul McCartney's live and Let Die (you know the James Bond theme song). Why? I have no clue...actually after what seems like an eternity fumbling around for a punch line we see a choir of frogs singing the song, Two minutes of screen time for a throw away joke about a short film that Paul McCartney produced that almost no one has seen in the US-Rupert and the Frog Song.The film is full of set ups to jokes that are so obscure that not even Jude would get them.(see what I'm getting at Thomas?) The humor is either obvious slapstick or these obscure duds. Clearly this what happens when you get too many animators and lock them in a room with a predetermined release date.Whats worse this seems like a (better) version of the dreadful Happily N'ever After so that those of us who suffered through that piece of horse hockey, get to watch a chunk of the plot reused (to better effect) here. Shrek three can't win for losing.Wait for Cable"
250,Shrek the Third,5,22 May 2007,painfully disappointing and bad,"'Shrek the Third' is the classic case of a movie being made just to turn a profit. And making 122 million in its first weekend is definitely close to turning a profit. The charm and charisma of the first Shrek is gone, but the absolutely fabulous performances of Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy are not to be missed. The film is very disappointing, but it is funny. In the end, you'll leave upset at how it didn't grab you like the original.Shrek (Mike Myers) has never been the social type, so asking him to be king is not a good idea. Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) dad has died, and he didn't have a son. So Shrek is the heir, something he doesn't want to do. His next task is to find Fiona's cousin Artie (Justin Timberlake) with the help of Donkey (Murphy) and Puss (Banderas) and install him as the king. Meanwhile, a mad Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has decided to attempt to claim what is 'rightfully his' - the kingdom of Far Far Away.As always, the actors are great with the jokes, which are many in number. Antonio Banderas especially is hysterical. Just the character of Puss in Boots is absolutely phenomenal. He is the best part of the movie. Myers once again shines as the impatient and sarcastic title character, while Murphy is again in top form. Diaz's Fiona isn't in the movie as much as before, nor is she as funny. It's the writer's fault. Rupert Everett is also funny, as are Eric Idle and Justin Timberlake. Idle is a wonderful spoof actor, as evidenced in the legendary Monty Python series.The biggest problem is the direction and writing. What happened? The film is funny, but it's just not entertaining. It went by really fast, almost too fast. I couldn't comprehend anything that was happening, and none of the jokes are overly memorable, in exception to Puss. It was just really sad to watch the film fail as every joke is a fart or sex joke (I know, it's a kids movie). After falling, one character says 'I haven't had a trip like that since college'. Are you kidding me? That's not a joke for a kids movie. The movie tries to hard to be funny at times, and it has really gotten old. This is a bigger disappointment than Spider-Man 3, which at least had some memorable moments. Shrek the Third has some pretty inappropriate jokes, so I'd say children under 11 or 12 might want to hold off until they're older.5/10 --spy"
251,Shrek the Third,5,19 May 2007,Not As  Funny Or Entirtaining!!!!,"I give this movie a 5 because It wasn't that great, didn't seem as funny or as exciting as the fist two movies.When I first found out about a third movie at first I didn't think it was needed.But because the first two were such a success and held my interest I went to see this one.I just got back from the movies and I'm not that thrilled.It just proves that I'm getting to old for Fairy Tails.There where some parts that where funny, but most of it didn't seem that funny to me.Unlike the fist two where I thought mainly the whole movie was great.Not just in humor but in story tell as well.I can't say that the movie sucked, but I can say that it wasn't that great.There wasn't to much of a story line either.And poor Charming, trying to do his mother's work when he should have just gave up after realizing that he can't win.If you ask me they should have just ended the story with the second movie.But again I'm not saying it sucked, it just wasn't that great.So far ""Ghost Rider"" and Spider-Man 3 are my favorites for 2007.But go ahead take your kids, grand kids, family, and friends to see this movie. See it for your self. The movie it not a waste of time, it is just a waste of money."
252,Shrek the Third,4,19 May 2007,Conservative Moms with Kids....,"Well... boys....Just got back from seeing it with my 19 year old, 9 year old and 6 year old boys. My 6 year old is my thermometer for movies. If he sits still its a safe bet... if not.... don't pay money to abuse the people around you.Last week we went to see Spiderman 3. He never said a word except at the end when ""someone"" was hurt (don't want to spoil S3 for anyone) he said.... ""Mommy I don't ever want to watch Spiderman movies again"" then after a short pause he added. ""But I do want to get all the Spiderman toys""I don't think hes ever asked for Shrek toys.I think that again, in the Shrek movies, there is just too much adult humor, the kids get lost and in this one there just wasn't enough adult or kid humor to keep it afloat. The biggest laugh was when Shrek said POOP at the beginning of the movie.Don't pay money to see this. Take them to see Spiderman 3 instead and buy this for Christmas.Concerns for this conservative parent: The woman with a mans voice (confusing for kids) bra burning?? Snow White looks really evil a few times but is supposedly a good guy Donkey looking at Shreks privatesThank you for reading my review."
253,Shrek the Third,8,4 June 2008,I liked it surprising more than the second one.,"Even though I can enjoy the Shrek movies, I just never have a too big fan of it. The first movie was good but also sort of overrated and the second part had too many misses in it. I therefor also expected to not enjoy this third part of the Shrek series and my expectations for it weren't high. Nevertheless I really enjoyed this movie and it was a positive thing that the film-makers this time actually tried out some new things, rather than making this movie a rehearsal of the first 2 Shrek movies.Seems like they stopped with the spoofing this time and went for some originality and creativity of its own. It doesn't make ""Shrek the Third"" the Shrek movie with the most laughs in it but it also makes it the less forced of the Shrek movies. The previous Shrek basically tried to be constantly funny and often went over-the-top with this. This movie rarely goes over-the-top, perhaps only toward its ending and then mostly with its action.Because the story is more original of its own the movie as a whole also feels fresher and therefor it becomes a pleasant movie to watch, even if it doesn't have the most laughs in it. It must also have got to do with the fact that this movie is directed by different people than those who directed the first two Shrek movies. A good choice to go with different directors, even though its also true that it must have something to do that director of the first two Shrek movies Andrew Adamson is now days a successful live-action film-maker and he is the director of the first two Chronicles of Narnia movies. Technology hasn't stand still since the last Shrek movie, for this Shrek movie is better looking then ever before. The animations are simply flawless and it most be lovely to work with technology like this. The opportunities are basically endless and there are no boundaries.Good thing is that they also didn't introduced too many new characters this time. Basically most characters who also appeared in the first two Shrek movies re-appear in this movie again but in a more restrained way, which assures that this Shrek movie is really about Shrek.Thing I don't like about the Shrek movies is its moralistic undertone and themes. There's always a message in these movies and I feel the movies would be a lot more entertaining if they completely drop this and go for simple pure entertainment instead. All of the Shrek movies have a certain amount of drama in it. I'm just not waiting for this amount of drama whenever I'm watching an animated movie.If they continue making on Shrek movies in the same trend as this movie than ""Shrek Goes Fourth"" might not turn out to be such a bad movie after all.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
254,Shrek the Third,6,24 May 2007,Shrek the third,"So, I just caught the 10 pm show of Shrek 3 and I gotta say, as a fan of the first two I was not impressed. In fact, I was very disappointed. It literally was the same movie the third time, and instead of infusing it with tons of fun and pop culture references like the second Shrek did, it just relied on its plot and genre convention to further it. There was ONE funny moment. The Led Zeppelin reference was good and was funny, but as a whole, the movie was a phoned in experience. Again, what a disappointment. At least most of the stuff shown in the trailer was in the first fifteen minutes or so and you get fresh stuff from there on out. The sad thing is that this fresh stuff feels dull and rehashed even though you've never seen it before.Terrible effort all the way around"
255,Shrek the Third,8,22 May 2007,Same as the first two,"A lot of people have been saying that the spark is gone. I say the opposite. Its still there. Shrek The Third delivers the exact same as the first two films in the series. For me the films have never been about laugh out loud comedy. Come to think of it I think I only ever laughed once or twice during either of the first two. What Shrek is about is the in jokes. Its a spoof of fairy tales with a modern twists. Hence the humour comes from the princesses being Charlie's Angels like fighting machines, or Prince Charming being an arrogant jerk. The visual gags are what makes a Shrek movie funny and as it is three delivers just as many if not more than the first two movies. here, the king has died and Shrek is next in line for the crown. The only other blood relative is Arthur. Not wanting the crown, Shrek sets off to find Arthur so that he and Fiona can get on with their lives. They arrive at a snotty high school and find Arthur to be a put upon youth. meanwhile, Charming has amassed an army to take over Far Far Away and so they have. Upon returning to the kingdom, Shrek is captured and its up to the gang to save the day. As I said, the film is all about the visual gags and that's what makes it amusing. In this way Shrek The Third is just as good as the first two in the series. Give it a shot."
256,Shrek the Third,3,21 May 2007,Been There Done That,"Standing alone this movie holds it's own against the countless other feature-length cartoons we have been treated to recently.That is the problem -- you cannot view it as a standalone work. The first Shrek is an excellent movie. While the original Shrek bore no resemblance to the original book by William Steig (yeah and who actually knows this was based on a book older than most of the audience). BTW, CDB and CDC are must reads from this author more well known for his work in the New Yorker...Shrek the Third makes the mistake of believing it's own hype. For most well-loved movie ""classics"" of our time it is the story that makes the movie. Bringing a good story tells itself regardless of its surrounding. Good animation can enhance a wonderful story, but on it's own it is just disjointed bits hung on a clothesline. It seems like the original idea was left on the cutting room floor in the mad dash for marketing money.The collective comedic talent in this movie is astounding. John Cleese and Eric Idle, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as well as Cheri Oteri, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph. You also have John Krasinski and Rupert Everett. While their voices are memorable, this is the least of their abilities. They were given no opportunity to feature their true talents and the movie suffered for it. I was so hoping to see witty barbs and new site gags in the movie (and an actual plot) and was left wanting. The producers would have served themselves well to break from the usual pattern of actors performing their voice overs alone and allowing the cast to interact, write and improvise ... something most of this cast is well-known for.Too bad -- it could have been so much more."
257,Shrek the Third,4,20 May 2007,Don't waste your money and time!,"I was really a Shrek fan and could not wait to see what would happen in Shrek3. But I was SO disappointed after watching it on Friday:( It was just a boring story with no fresh idea. And the ending, everyone could create such an old styled ending that could be found in every single fairy tale book. I went to the movie theater Friday afternoon and there were about 10 people there. I didn't hear people laugh during the playing. Remember in 1 and 2? People were burst into laughter here and there. The only thing I like in Shrek 3 is the donkey babies. They are very cute! Don't know if there would be a Shrek4 but if yes, please make a fun and out-of-expectation story!"
258,Shrek the Third,7,18 May 2007,"not great, but not awful ...","well, most of the national critics panned it, but those here locally were pretty favorable ...some good moments, just a few really awful.*** minor spoiler: I'd heard that the song at the Frog King's funeral was in poor taste, I thought it was handled fairly well - however his ""conveyence"" to the Underworld was *definitely* in poor taste, an ill-timed joke, I believe. I also didn't care for Artie's lil' ""scene"" with Merlin, but that was the absolute worst for me! END SPOILER ***I would have loved to have seen the ""princesses"" developed a further, but all in all, we'll probably wind up adding it to our DVD collection, and I could possibly handle another go at the theater ...One note, the trailers before were highly inappropriate, we went with our pre-school daughter, and another couple and their daughter, who is the same age. Some of the trailers (Transformers - scary, Simpsons - a tad vulgar, Hot Rod - too Jackass-ish) might give pause to parents' of younger children!!!But this was by far the BEST Transformers' trailer, and almost cemented the fact that I'll go see it in the theater!"
259,Shrek the Third,9,20 May 2007,"""Third"" is first in line this summer","When I walked into my local movie theater to see 'Shrek the Third', I was in a state of depression about the summer movie season. That meandering mess called 'Spider-Man 3' instilled within me the belief that this would be a summer of prequels with disappointing content and big box office numbers. So needless to say, I was prepared for another letdown in a summer that seemed as if it would be full of 'em. Guess not. From the second the film's opening title rolled, 'Shrek The Third' broke my state of pessimism about the summer movie season and reminded me what a great popcorn film should be...side-splitting comedy, high drama, larger-than-life action, and a little romance thrown in for good measure. Mike Myers is back as Shrek, who, due to a tragic turn of events, is slated to become king of Far Far Away. Desperate to stick the crown on someone else's head, Shrek embarks on a journey to find Arthur Pendragon (Justin Timberlake, who, no, is not really that bad of an actor), the only other heir to the throne. Joining Shrek, of course, are Donkey (Eddie Murphy, hilarious as usual) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas, having the time of his life), although he does leave Fiona (Cameron Diaz, also enjoying herself) behind. Like 'Shrek 2', this film is a mishmash of little-kid humor (haha, he farted!) and pop-culture nonsequiturs (a ""Just Say Nay"" program, a chorus of frogs singing ""Live and Let Die""). And, like 'Shrek 2', the folks at Dreamworks Animation have created a marvel that is a refreshing antidote to the typical Hollywood film. 'Shrek the Third' brings back lovable characters (Julie Andrews as the Queen of Far Far Away, Rupert Everett as the evil Prince Charming) and introduces great new ones (Eric Idle as a nutty Merlin, Cheri Oteri as Sleeping Beauty). It manages to hew to the formula that has made the other films so popular while still seeming fresh, relevant, and witty. Not the best of the three, but it certain holds it's own among parts 1 and 2. If this is an indication of the rest of the summer, maybe it ain't so bad after all."
260,Shrek the Third,9,18 May 2007,"Amazingly, these just keep getting better...","After seeing the second Shrek, I figured there was nothing else that could possibly top it, but I was wrong. While the third installment explores many of the themes of the first two, it still manages to explore some new creative themes. What this film however best accomplishes is not only making a parody of classic fairy tales, but also the lives of American teenagers! The act of Justin Timberlake meshed surprisingly well with the act of those who had been through the previous two. Besides that, the animation was as great as ever, and the action sequences as brilliantly choreographed as before. But beyond all this, the humor will have you rolling in your seat just as much as ever."
261,Shrek the Third,,16 March 2008,Enjoyable even if it is rather overblown and lacks a real core of wit and story,"Shrek and Fiona are finding it hard going standing in for the King and Queen of Far Far Away Land but at least the end is in sight. However when King Harry dies and leaves the throne to Shrek (the only other heir is a high-school student), the problem of public appearances and endless ceremony appears not to be going away. So, despite the worrying news of Fiona's pregnancy, Shrek sets sail with his friends to bring Arthur, the only other heir, back to claim his throne (rightful or not) so Shrek can get back to his swamp. However, while he is away, Prince Charming lead a cast of villains on a coup d'etat on the leaderless land.The third Shrek film was rather beaten by critics when it was released, to the point that I decided not to bother with it in the cinemas (although the impact of a kiddie audience also helped put me off). This evening I decided to watch the films that LoveFilm had sent me and, as if to show that I do tend to watch a diverse mix of things I found that my viewing for tonight was the brutal Irréversible followed by this film (well, after a short recovery break). The contrast is different I'm sure you'll agree but I was looking forward to Shrek after that experience. So perhaps I forgave it some things that I wouldn't have otherwise as a form of release from the bleakness. In this way I found some of the film to be quite fun but even in this state I still have to say that the film is weaker than the second, which was in turn weaker than the first.The problem is again with the plot. In the first film the story was the core of everything and all the references and jokes branched off this. Here the opposite is true as the story seems to happy with lots of material put around it. The difference can be best seen in the fact that the plot mostly provides a frame for the film but the laughs and fun generally come in the asides and the support characters rather than the main flow or the main characters. This is not a massive failure, because the laughs are there, but it is at very least a weakness and after a while it became noticeable that I was not really that interested in Shrek or Arthur but just looking forward to the next scene with the Gingerbread Man. Ironically the plot is rather complex and will probably be over the head of the child viewers and it did make me long for a simpler but stronger story.The cast continue to do pretty well regardless. Myers and Diaz are both OK mainly because the film doesn't hand them great material to work with. Murphy and Banderas are both fun for the opposite reason while the supporting cast of Big Bad Wolf, Gingerbread, pigs etc all continue to be fun. Timberlake, Andrews, Everett, McShane and so on are OK but not great with only Python's Idle and Cleese standing out among the star names.Overall then an enjoyable film with just about enough laughs to carry it but still the weakest in the Shrek series. The plot is overly complex and the majority of fun belongs to the minor characters while the title roles are too tied up in the busy narrative to have time to consistently deliver the laughs. Shrek Goes Forth (or something like that) seems inevitable so hopefully the makers can take what continues to work from here and put right what has been falling down in the last two films."
262,Shrek the Third,8,19 May 2007,An ogre by any other name smells just as sweet,"The most impressive thing about the third Shrek movie is that it doesn't stink. It is, after all, not only a sequel but also the third in a series that prides itself in its clever wit and relevance. I was hoping that Shrek the Third would be close to the first two, but I didn't honestly think it would have enough juice to really slay me in my seat. Er, metaphorically speaking.But Shrek 3 IS fun. It's been three years since the second one, and Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz have lower Q ratings nowadays. Were kids going to swarm the theater for the further adventures of the giant green ogre, or was the series played out? You'd assume the latter, given kids' attention spans and the fact that there's other kid-oriented stuff coming out.Had I disliked the movie, I could have called the movie ""Dreck""; even better, if there'd been some romance between Shrek and his never-seen mom, I could call it ""Oedipus Shrek."" But geez, I liked it. Now what the heck am I supposed to say about it? How about just ""What the Shrek is going on here?"" Why must they toy with me so? Shrek (Myers) is tapped to become the new king of Far, Far Away when the king (John Cleese) falls ill. But the Shrek with that, says the green blob. There's another heir, he learns, so he, Donkey (Murphy), and Puss (Antonio Banderas) set off to find Arthur, a mopey high school misfit voiced by Justin Timberlake. (Note: I knew Timberlake was in the movie, and I thought he was Arthur's voice, but Artie sounded... well, like a high school kid, maybe even younger.) Meanwhile, Shrek's absence gives good ol' Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) the chance to take over Far, Far Away and RULE! Also aiding Shrek are his pals from other fairy tales, such as the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf (perpetually in drag and possibly a victim of Stockholm Syndrome, only in reverse), and others. Princess Fiona (Diaz) mobilizes her own galpals (Snow White, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty) to help stave off Charming's army, which is made up of villains from various tales, such as Captain Hook (Ian McShane), the Wicked Witch, Cyclops, and Rumplestiltskin. It sounds like an excuse to shoehorn as many familiar names into the movie as possible, but some of the characters do seem to justify their existences. Oh, and know who else shows up? Eric Idle, voicing Merlin, who here is a half-crazed former teacher at Artie's school.There's excellent use of song, too; one screaming attack by Snow White (Amy Poehler) is accompanied by the opening yowl of Robert Plant on Led Zeppelin's legendary ""Immigrant Song""; this is followed by scorching vocals by Anne Wilson of Heart on ""Barracuda."" Sure, this stuff won't matter to the kidlets, but the adults will get a kick out of cleverly used music from their own childhood.Here's why the movie works. None of the leads overdoes things, which is pretty tough to resist when you're doing a kids' movie, I imagine. Myers can be awfully hammy, and so can Murphy. But they're so used to their characters that they didn't go over the top, instead letting the script provide the laughs. Shrek is obstinate and foolish, and Donkey is boisterous and sassy, but they play neatly off each other without making the movie all about them. The first movie was about Shrek meeting Donkey and then Fiona, and the second was about Not Fitting In with Fiona's family. This time around, everyone's saying, ""Hey, we know you know us, so let's concentrate on the story."" It's a strange and ultimately refreshing approach, and it's what keeps the franchise from going stale. (They better hope so, because the fourth movie will be out in a few years.) All in all, the movie succeeds in every way it wanted to. Shrek had me tittering and guffawing at appropriate times, always a good thing. Nothing ruins a movie like laughing at inopportune times, unless the movie's so bad it's good. Shrek the Third easy reaches the level of comedy and hijinks as it had in the first two movies, not letting up with the funny. There's just no real decline in quality here, folks; this is a movie your kids will heart if they enjoyed the first two."
263,Shrek the Third,7,8 April 2017,"Great, but flawed","This film is really good for the most part. Unlike what many may say, this is actually a great Shrek movie in my opinion. I do, however, agree at the fact this film is flawed. One reason, the story, while it's pretty good, it can be uninteresting and very predictable for the most part. There are parts where this film will make you question a few things in a few scenes, as the direction is somewhat sloppy. Another thing I did notice with this film is that there are a LOT of characters in this film, almost too the point there's too many. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it can feel a bit over the top and a little redundant to those who just care about the main characters. Other than all that, I honestly think this film is not only a great sequel to Shrek 2, but a staple in the Shrek film series, as this film not only has a pretty decent story, but it has great CGI and great voice acting as well. And not only that, but this film has some funny parts in it. While this film may not be as good as the other Shrek films, it's still really good, and I recommend to anyone who's a fan of Shrek, as they will most likely enjoy it, like I did."
264,Shrek the Third,7,29 January 2017,A somewhat weaker third instalment,"The king is ill so Shrek and Fiona have to take over various royal duties with fairly disastrous results. Then the King dies and it looks as though Shrek is going to be the next king, something he does not want, luckily just before dying the king mentioned another heir; Arthur. Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots set off to find Arthur and as their boat sets sail Fiona tells Shrek that she is pregnant. While they are away bringing a reluctant Arthur back to Far, Far Away Prince Charming is rallying various fairy tale villains to help him seize the kingdom. On the way home Shrek and his fellow travellers meet the wizard Merlin who helpfully transports them back home unfortunately swapping the bodies of Donkey and Puss! By now Charming has taken the Kingdom and Fiona and the various fairy tale 'princesses' are imprisoned but not for long.The first two films in the series were a lot of fun but sadly while this is still pretty decent it falls a fair way short of those two films. Trying to add elements of the Legend of King Arthur didn't work as well as they might have done as he was a fairly boring character. Other aspects of the story just don't make sense; most notably the idea that when the king dies Shrek would be the next ruler rather than Princess Fiona. There is also a lack of decent songs; apart from the rather amusing use of the theme from 'Live and Let Die' during the King's funeral none were memorable. There are some good points of course; having Donkey and Puss swap bodies was rather amusing, the king's extended death scene was hilarious (loved the fly) and it is great the see that the damsels were far from in distress as they broke out of the dungeon. Overall a decent enough film but a bit disappointing as a 'Shrek' film."
265,Shrek the Third,7,8 May 2015,Definitely The Weakest In The Franchise But still good,"This is defiantly the weakest in the franchise, but I still enjoyed it, The Characters are likable, The Animation is great, I know some people didn't care for the jokes but some of it actually works, I kinda liked the humor, and I enjoyed the story. My flaws with this film, some of the jokes could've been better, the story could've a little better, and also why did Prince Charming have to be Villain I mean seriously come on!!!!! Overall though with all that said i still had a fun time with Shrek The Third. Overall I give Shrek the third a nice and solid 7/10 Also I thought the ending was cute and I liked the baby ogres in this film and I thought they were really cute and funny as well"
266,Shrek the Third,7,15 August 2014,A step backwards,"Prince Charming is reduced to dinner theater and he wants revenge. King Harold is ill and Shrek is the next heir to Far, Far Away. Shrek isn't that good with being a royal and doesn't want to give up his swamp. King reveals that there is another heir named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). After the death of the King, Shrek sets off to find Artie with the help of Donkey and Puss in Boots. Princess Fiona is left at home to battle Prince Charming's attempted coup with her royal girlfriends.Starting with the king dying is a hard way to keep the tone light. Also Shrek is separated from Fiona for the bulk of the movie. Then there is the new character Artie who is the least interesting character in this world. However I still love the cast of characters in this franchise. I also love the new princesses. They are a lot of fun. This is a step back but the franchise lives on."
267,Shrek the Third,7,30 December 2013,Diminishing returns,"Following the death of Fiona's father, and his installation as acting King (which he finds objectionable), Shrek heads off in search of a member of the bloodline to be installed as King.With this third instalment, the law of diminishing returns sets in. Yes, it is funny, and eye catching, and the voice talent does well (joined this time by Justin Timberlake as young Artie), but there is a feeling of having seen it all before. Some of the gags are clever (using Live And Let Die at the King's funeral as an oblique reference to Paul McCartney having done the Frog Song, for instance), but things are starting to feel a little stale.I would still say that it is worth seeing rather than not seeing, though."
268,Shrek the Third,7,7 January 2013,A feel-good sequel undermined by it's unoriginal storyline and uneven script,"I was much anticipated to see Shrek The Third after being a fan of the first two. Then, I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it. OK, it doesn't have the heart and charm of the first two and I know lots of people hated it, but I at least gave it credit for being what it was.It showed a lot of promise, but everything else in the story, despite being fast-paced, is contrived and has been done a million times before (not to mention it borrows the same concept from Happily N'ever After, the film that came out the same year before this). The script has some nice moments and a good moral lesson about being yourself, but it does have several scenes that are dragged and it added way too much characters.Despite it's flaws, it does have some crisp and smooth animation along with some nice music from Harry Gregson Williams. Most of the new characters are great including the main ones from the first two are as charming as ever especially the princesses like Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty. It also has some great humor that would never stop making me laugh including the Merlin scenes and the part where Snow White sings and goes into Led-Zeppelin style against the trees being the highlight. The voice acting isn't anything to fault with since it's great to see Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and Antonion Banderas along with some new cameos.Overall, Shrek the Third isn't as fresh or compelling as the first two films, but it's still an enjoyable, if not flawed, sequel that is undermined by it's unoriginal storyline and uneven script."
269,Shrek the Third,7,12 November 2010,Not too bad but it is a rip off of the classic Disney movies.,I got this on DVD a few years ago and surprisingly it wasn't too bad. What really bugs me about Shrek is that its a rip off of the classic Disney movies.The prequel is about Shrek and the rest of the crew and this time Shrek finds out that Fiona is pregnant and as her father dies Shrek has to find another ruler for Far Far Away. So Donkey and Puss along with Shrek go on an adventure to find the next ruler.Turns out its a nerdy teenager named Arthur(Justin Timberlake in his 1st animated role)who at first doesn't want to be the next ruler but as the movie progresses you can see that he does become a king.You can probably figure the rest of it for yourselves but its an OK movie. Not as good as the other 2 but still its a decent film. If you love Enchanted then you will love this.
270,Shrek the Third,9,2 July 2010,So brilliant!,"Shrek and Fiona are heirs to Far Far Away. Wait a minute, what?! An ogre in charge? I love the idea personally, but i'm sure mayhem would be an ever day occurrence. So, very sensibly, Shrek goes to find another heir. A good thing too. Artie is lovable, just like the poor little unpopular kid in cheesy chick flicks, you pity and love him. Donkey has his baby dronkeys, which are beyond cute, and Shrek has some on the way. Wow. Scary thought. The acting in this movie is fantastic and the story line is brilliant. The hard core Disney princesses make for laughs a plenty, for example there is a brilliant twist on Snow White's relationship with animals. So go to see this film and any one who slates this movie needs to go and buy themselves a decent sense of humour. No offence."
271,Shrek the Third,8,10 May 2010,I certainly do NOT understand the (6.1) user rating for this movie!,"I just watched the Shrek trilogy. I was expecting this third one to be awful based on the IMDb rating but I was shocked to discover that I actually liked the film. In fact, in my opinion, the 1st Shrek is the 'worst' one out of the three- with sub-par graphics, less of a story line compared to these two (taking the time and tech developments at the time into consideration. (Shrek the 2nd is the best one out of the three, but none of them can compare to any of Pixar's gems.)I just wanted to express that I find the rating for this installment unbelievable, and would love it if some users could actually clarify their rating and give valid reason(s) for it."
272,Shrek the Third,8,9 December 2009,"Should be called ""Prince Charming, part 2""","Basically, I'll copy/paste most important pieces I wrote for the second sequel.Shrek 3 is not an animated movie in any common sense one would or could expect. It is a real movie disguised in an animated form. If you look at it that way, you can much better understand the 'subtle' layer under-laying below the surface which is rude, arrogant and shallow.Shrek The Third picks up the story where it left at the previous sequel and tries to establish disturbed balance it introduced. Prince Charming, Part II, as I call it, is not (only) about Shrek. The main character here, you wan't believe it, is Prince Charming; he portray human greed, self-centered, self-important figure in an attempt to live up to it's pre-programmed life, unable to cope with reality and the fact expected (or desired) things are never going to happen. Does anyone here recognize themself a little bit? Be honest.Here comes a layer that usually lacks much needed subtlness during the movie: By no coincidence, Prince Charming is at moments emotional (crying), and angry at it's extremes, swinging between those two feelings. Society not accepting his behavior shows cruelty (laughing) that evokes an emotion of abandoned creature, loneliness, disappointment and despair. A natural response to this is a defensive mechanism imprinted in every living soul on Earth: anger and wish for a revenge, that unfortunately overtook's our anti-hero's heaart. He is just 'a human' unable to cope with his loss.This is the reason I think the main character is not Shrek at all, who is slightly pushed aside for the good second half of the movie. The leak of subtlness in the story is what makes this sequel weaker than the first one (altought the chosen story is by no means weak and uninteresting); the way it was realized does."
273,Shrek the Third,7,7 August 2009,"Not bad, could have been better","I have read quite a few of the other reviews, and I have to say that I agree with most of them overall.I really loved the first two Shrek movies. They were fresh, and funny.This movie was pretty good, but lost me towards the end. I liked that the ladies had to ""take care of business"", and especially the animal scenes with Beauty.At one point, Fiona tells Charming how much trouble he will be in when Shrek comes back. At the end of the movie I was thinking to myself, why would Charming be worried about Shrek when the studio has turned him into a wuss? When he gets back from his little trip, he is immediately captured and spends most of the rest of the movie in chains.This made me think about the first movie, when Shrek takes on the prince's knights all by himself. Kicking butt, because HE'S AN OGRE! None of that here, Shrek obediently gets captured and just sits there and takes all the abuse.As well, during Shrek's little trip, they spend entirely too much time with the kid Arty, trying to convince him to come along. It got a little boring at this point, however the beginning of the trip was actually fairly funny. At one point, a girl in a high school asking Shrek if he would take her friend to a dance because she's into fairy tale creatures, and of Shrek ""thou doth vex her so soothly"".Not a bad movie but just doesn't live up to the standards set by the first two."
274,Shrek the Third,6,2 August 2009,6.7,"Shrek the Third fits into the category of The Curse of the trilogy. The third film is the weakest in the trilogy. It looses the humor and some of the fun. Mike Myers returns as Shrek, the big green ogre. This time, when King Harold(John Cleese)dies, he asks Shrek to become king. Shrek doesn't want to, so he goes looking for the next heir, Arthur(Justin Timberlake). Arthur is an annoying dweeb. Shrek, Donkey(Eddie Murphey in one of his best roles)and Puss in Boots(Antonio Banderas)go off looking for Arthur. Meanwhile, Shrek's pregnant wife Fiona(Cameron Diaz) and her friends have to escape from Prince Charming(Rupert Everett). Shrek took care of his mother in the last film. So this time it's personal.Charming is going to take over the kingdom and kill Shrek. Shrek the Third is an eyefull of visual delight. But it's far from being as good as Shrek or even Shrek 2. I give it a 6.7 because it lacks the things that the first two films have. I liked Shrek the Third, but it wasn't as good as the first two. I am giving it a recommendation."
275,Shrek the Third,4,8 June 2009,"A good storyline, but lacking that emotional feel the first two gave","Shrek has been and will most likely always be one of my favorite movies. Being that way, I wanted to see this one more than anyone else I knew. And unfortunately, I was left disappointed at the film. Being the only Dreamworks production that could ever top a Pixar film, Shrek had my standards a little too high for this third installment. The cast was good, containing former SNL players for voice acting, but did absolutely nothing for that soft spot that the previous two movies poked at. Basically, Shrek the Third is just another movie...nothing notable and maybe two things particularly funny and surely will create some kind of money loss for the fourth. Perhaps useful if you wish to kill ninety minutes, but otherwise do not bother."
276,Shrek the Third,6,15 March 2009,"Enjoyable, but a near miss and only a hair's breadth away from being a flop.","A wonderful animated adventure set in the fairytale land of Far, Far Away. A little unnecessary and simple but thanks to the help of the old Shrek characters and some clever humour it fits in well as the final of the Shrek trilogy.The frog king Harold (voiced by John Cleese) has died of sickness and old age. This now makes Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) the new king. After hearing this Shrek, Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) go on a quest to find the second heir Artie (voiced by Justin Timberlake) so that Shrek will never have to take up such a responsibility. Meanwhile a group of angry fairytale villains led by the evil Prince Charming (voiced by Rupert Everett) have invaded Far, Far Away after their own Happily Ever After. Charming captures Princess Fiona, (voiced by Cameron Diaz) Queen Lillian (voiced by Julie Andrews) and all the other good fairytale characters, becomes king and sets death traps for Shrek for when he returns. It all seems as if King Charming has finally won but with the magician Merlin (voiced by Eric Idle) on Shrek's side there may still be some hope.It's a very clever story that shows the world of fairy tales in a completely different form."
277,Shrek the Third,6,5 October 2008,A charming tongue-in-cheek affair.,"One is bound and has to compare Shrek the Third with its wonderful prequels and for that reason Shrek the Third is not as funny or as entertaining.The animation is adorable and as realistic and crystal-clear as ever, it really does have a real charming and aesthetic quality that surpasses other animations.I for one felt the story was well-balanced and imaginative. The story, if rather predictable as to its eventual end, is reprieved by the introduction of other minor characters such as Lancelot, Captain Hook, Merlin and so on. Shrek the Third does not coast along as easily as previous Shreks, possibly due to the gags not being as funny, but for me Puss in Boots and Donkey are not given enough screen-time.Shrek the Third is an entertaining and charming picture. The film may not live up to Shrek 1 and 2, but Shrek 1 and 2 were roaring successes and Shrek the Third is competently managed and mastered. I hear Shrek Four maybe in the pipeline and I do hope that it does get the green light, on the basis of Shrek the Third the green light should be not be long in coming!"
278,Shrek the Third,7,18 July 2008,good time pass with a couple of classic scenes....,"Many people thought that Shrek's charming dialogue and witty actions were held in abeyance with this sequel. Shrek did not spend enough time being an ogre, but an irresponsible person that can neither take charge of the kingdom nor face fatherhood. Since Shrek wants to desperately leave Fiona's Kingdom and go back to his ""vermin-filled shack (the swamp),"" he decides to abdicate the thrown to Arthur, a distant relative to the royal family of Far Far Away who is now the acknowledged loser of a medieval high schoolBut some complications ensue and once again we are introduced to Prince Charming who can barely even pose as an ostensible threat. The terror faced by their kingdom is used to arouse laughter, with strange accidents and weird villains. But I have to say that the funniest part of the movie is when the Frog King dies. Merlin was also hilarious. With that being said, although Shrek the Third is not as good as the previous two movies in the series, it does evoke good laughter. Definitely not a failure."
279,Shrek the Third,8,27 February 2008,Fun fun fun,"I have to say, I was a bit peeved when I first heard that Shrek the Third is coming out. The first two movies were alright, I supposed; but I thought a third installment would be somewhat extraneous.Fortunately, I was wrong.Shrek the Third has all that the previous two films have, if not more. Sure, the land Far Far Away may have lost its original wonder, and a talking ogre may now seem like an everyday thing. However, Shrek still did not lose its fun touch and continues to give us the childish chuckles that we crave.Fun and games is what Shrek is all about. You'll sure get a laugh out of it."
280,Shrek the Third,8,29 January 2008,Is it one too many?,"I've read a number of complaints that it's simply getting long in the tooth.Sure it's story isn't intricate as the first movie. But I found it much more hilarious than the second which was too much a parody of just about everything. Yes the third does parody, but touches the heart of the first movie that the second one completely missed. I loved it and compared to The Simpsons, (which got long in the tooth about 7 years prior to the movie) Shrek is no where near long in the tooth. Even by the promised 5th movie could I see wanting this series to end. I've come to love the characters and it was a bit of a cheer up with all thats going on personally. One confusion that makes it a bit complicated is having the hero named Arthur. So is this the real Arthur? Will Arthur be killed away from far far away? 8/10Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10"
281,Shrek the Third,6,28 January 2008,an all right movie,man i have been waiting to see this movie for a long time. cause i loooooooooove the shrek series. when i saw this movie it didn't make laugh so hard like the other one's but i was an alright movie though.the voices are good man better than good the funniest guy in shrek is donkey.the director shouldn't have announced making the fourth one i bet it will be in the bottom hundred and i don't want that especially for a funny movie so shame on u.i didn't know justin timber lake was the voice of Artie till i saw the movie Artie just sounded like him.
282,Shrek the Third,,7 January 2008,"A Shrek take, on the King Arthur story.","At least the three Shrek stories are each unique, and only build on characters developed in the earlier ones. I will still think, as I suppose most will, that the first one was the best.Here Shrek and Fiona visit her parents in Far, Far Away land, but dad, the King (as a frog) is ill and dying. Shrek and Fiona are made temporary King and Queen, but they just aren't cut out for the job, especially Shrek, as almost everything he gets involved in goes wrong.So most of the story is the search for the person who will become King. Prince Charming desperately wants to become King Charming, but the dying king had Arthur, or Artie, in mind. Analogous to the traditional King Arthur story, this Artie is young and small, and often picked on by others. This movie is a bit darker than the first two, in that both Fiona and Shrek become imprisoned separately, and there is talk of killing Shrek, and also of killing Artie. But Artie gives a speech to the bad guys about ""haven't you ever wanted to get out of your own way and become the person you really wanted to?""The animation is superb, and the characters that are supposed to be people, like Artie, look very life-like. As in traditional film making, where camera movement is used to add interest to a scene, the animation simulates all the various camera movements we have become used to."
283,Shrek the Third,6,5 January 2008,Lacks Shrekness...,"The first two movies proved to be excellent family entertainment (outstanding first one - good sequel). ""Shrek"" has always been a very clever crossover cuisine cinema of fables.One could expect a lot for the new sequel, but high expectations are easy to disappoint. While watching ""Shrek 3"" I had to think of those Disney TV Sequels: it feels like a reunion of friends... far more than like a good story. After all I was wondering what sense (besides making money) it makes to release sequel after sequel, year after year... why the hell did they spent that much money on a movie thats so far away from having the quality fans deserve and got used to !? In a short: only routine Shrek sequel that fails to meet the high quality standards of the series... perhaps kids will like it."
284,Shrek the Third,6,31 December 2007,Disappointment but still OK for DVD rental,"OK, liked the first two, so I wasn't expecting a sequel to live up to the first two, but this was really disappointing. The plot line was believable but dull. Shrek is made the next heir of Far Far Away unless he can find another heir, which he does. So Shrek, Donkey, and Puss head our on a quest to get the new heir and return him to Far Far Away. Justin Timberlake voices the new heir, Prince Artie (Arthur). This is a play off of King Aurthur. Timberlake's character never really brings about the endearing factor that Shrek or Donkey did in the first movie so there is really no one character who brings out a big emotional response. And while the merry trio is out looking for the new heir, Prince Charming is raising rebellion among the evil characters and they actually take over Far Far Away. The comedy just falls flat in this installment, in fact, I got more laughs out of the supporting characters such as Pinocchio and Gingee.The underlying plot of Shrek being afraid to be a daddy never really played out for me. Shrek has some nightmares and the nightmares weren't that good, for lack of a better word. The babies are kind of ugly to me and not cute like Dragon and Donkey's babies are. That may sound superficial, but hey it's an animated movie, you would expect them to make the kids cute. As I said, this subplot falls short as does the entire plot line.Shrek the Third has it's moments, but for those thinking it lives up to the promise of being ""The Best Shrek Yet"" will be sorely disappointed. Go ahead and rent it, don't buy it. If you like after renting, then buy.Thanks Gary"
285,Shrek the Third,6,30 December 2007,Decent,"I liked the Shrek movies pretty well. They put a whole new spin on fairy tales and teach you to look beneath the surface while poking sly fun at pop culture. All the main characters are good. My favorites would have to be Puss-in-boots and Donkey. Those two along with Shrek have wonderful chemistry. However, that being said, Shrek 3 did not live up to the standards of the first two movies.It wasn't bad. Very decent in fact, but it lacked the humor and the music and the fun of the first two. The storyline had the potential but it didn't have the polish or as many pop culture references as the other movies which added to the fun. The worst part of the movie though was Arthur. They should never had Justin Timberlake acting as his voice. The character came across as fake and overboard in its ""teen nerd slash rebel"" stereotype. Without him, the movie would have been fine. Arthur was too much.I would recommend this movie. It was nice. Maybe not as polished but still a lot better than a lot of movies coming out this year. The old characters still remain as lovable as ever. With the exception of Arthur, this was nice."
286,Shrek the Third,5,14 December 2007,The Ogre Is Starting To Stink,"Franchise films run the risk of overdoing it. This means becoming stale, predictable, or simply trying so hard to produce something off-kilter that it either alienates itself from its predecessors or, if not, becomes a cliché of sorts.The first SHREK was original, hysterically funny, and witty. Michael Myers' portrayal of a grumpy yet lovable ogre was spot-on. As was Eddie Murphy's (DREAMGIRLS) Donkey. SHREK 2 was helped tremendously by the incorporation of Puss-N-Boots played by Anthony Banderas' (THE 13th WARRIOR) over-the-top voice.All of the above are still in SHREK THE THIRD, and added to the cast are Justin Timberlake as Artie, the lost heir to the thrown of Far Far Away. Also coming in is Eric Idle as Merlin, a washed up magician living away from the shame of his past.What made the previous two Shrek films funny makes this one overly predictable and simply not laughable. It does have its moments, but they aren't thanks to Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, or Puss-N-Boots. Little things like Queen Lillian's (Julie Andrews) head ramming and singing are what sprinkle the film with a few light laughs. There are no belly-jiggling funnies to be found.The forced entry of the story of King Arthur (i.e., Artie) stilts the story terribly with the exception of Eric Idle's Merlin who does a few comical incantations that don't quite work out the way they're supposed to. Whereas the previous two films used other fairy tales to great advantage (the first one incorporated so much you'd be hard-pressed to include them all in one review, and the second one, too, had a few jabs at Disney itself), this one tries to beat the viewer over the head with the magic and it doesn't translate to much of anything .Even so, this is a modestly entertaining Shrekfest. All of the familiar characters are there and most movie watchers will feel right at home. But don't expect much from them."
287,Shrek the Third,,28 November 2007,*Spolier Alert*   Shrek decides to find a new king rather than take the throne-huh??,"--Spoilers-- Somehow in this edition of Shrek's adventures, Shrek decides that it would be better to install Arthur as king rather than rule himself which goes against what I think his father in law would have wanted. None of it makes any sense nor do his odd daddy isssues.Arthur (the boy who would be king) is a nerdy poorly written character played by Justin Timberlake.(who frankly shouldn't quit his day job). He actually has the nerve to put on the crown at the end-not a very poignant ending. He could have handed it back to Shrek-but no he really needs to be King and he deserves to be.Charming this time around is much worse than past films and simply put, not up to his mother's great villain standard. It's nice that they included Cinderella and various other fairy tale princesses, but the Saturday Night Live actresses are all wasted. You can see the writers straining while eating breakfast donuts to come up with something for them to do besides attend Fiona's baby shower.Worst of all, the writers think it's a great idea to have Puss and Donkey change voices which is not funny and distracting from the already poor story All in all, this was a really disappointing film that lacked courage from Shrek, any heroism whatsoever, and really any reason to view it."
288,Shrek the Third,3,23 August 2007,Oh Schreck!,"Shrek in German means fright (spelled: Schreck). And it is! What a disappointment. The film frightens you because it is so bad. Like there are lines that the individual characters are saying, but there is no story, no adventure, no climax, nothing to hope for, nothing to fear (except the bad writing and directing) nothing to die for, and nothing to believe in. but you know what? It's OK. Yes it is. Because the producers made a lot of money with it and that's worth something. Not to us, but to them. I think we should be happy for them, they work so hard in creating our entertainment that if they can get two good films out of a franchise the third one may suck as badly as Shrek three does. Again a real Schreck!!!! Money wasted (actually the pop corn was pretty good, a bit salty, but good. And the previews were awesome I forget which films they were previewing but they were so much better than the actual feature presentation! Wahtever."
289,Shrek the Third,4,19 August 2007,Strained ...,"... washed up, wrung out, drained, finished, rinsed. These are just a few descriptors that ran through my mind as I watched through the tedium of burnt out gags in the charmless wonder that was Shrek the Third.""Has the magic of Shrek finally disappeared?"" I had to ask myself.I felt there was less charm and more attempts at 'clever' gags which just fell flat on their faces. Whilst I wouldn't say the movie was a total failure, it certainly wasn't on a par with the first Shrek movie which I watched a number of times and always enjoyed.However, maybe this should be a lesson  a great movie doesn't always require a sequel. Sometimes just the memory of a great movie is enough . Sequels can have the uncanny ability to kill a movie which was once great."
290,Shrek the Third,7,12 August 2007,Not as good as the others ... but when is that ever the case?,"Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey and Puss in Boots are such common words among children they are starting to learn them before mummy and daddy. Now if a franchise is that popular, world wide acclaim, rocketing DVD sales, Academy Awards, they have a serious lot to live up to. Shrek the Third was DreamWorks's challenge. Shrek and Fiona are living a perfectly peaceful life spending a week filling in for the king, with obvious disasters while the Toad King is sick. But the Toad King is not only sick, he is on his death bed. Shrek is the next in line for the throne and is not ready to undertake this burden so he fares off with Donkey and Puss in Boots to find Arthur (or Artie) the only other heir to the throne. Fiona is getting ready to bring some more ogres into the world while Shrek is not sure if he would make a good father. Prince Charming meanwhile believes he is the rightful heir to the throne and plans to turn Far Far Away Land on its head to get his way. The entire original cast returns for this funnier than average animated film. Eddie Murphy rants and raves to create an ever likable donkey, Mike Myers finds the grumpy side of Shrek and Rupert Everett and Antonio Banderas are good as always. Minor characters Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man and the Three Little Pigs provide the best moments as always. Justin Timberlake also brings his vocal, um, talents to the unpopular Artie. The wizard Merlin does though become a bit grinding at times. Animation gets better ever Shrek and this is no exception. This is a kids movie with more than a few adult references but the kids will enjoy this one. Not as good as the first two, but really when does the third ever surpass the previous two."
291,Shrek the Third,4,4 August 2007,I'm sorry Puss in Boots...,"When I left the cinema after seeing this movie, I felt sorry. Sorry for my family for dragging them into this, sorry for the great voice-cast and most of all sorry for Puss in Boots.Almost everything in this movie just misses the point. Most jokes are boring and on the level of something that you'd hear in Thomas and Friends. Even Donkey, who I really liked in Shrek and Shrek 2, was a bit dull now. My absolute favorite, Puss in Boots, attempts to make things less awful with his cuteness, but the colorless storyline and useless appearance of captain Hook bored me to death. Normally I would advise people to just go and see any movie and don't listen to the critics, but for heaven's sake, don't go see this one! It'll spoil anything you've seen in the previous movies...!"
292,Shrek the Third,4,28 July 2007,"Easy to watch, even easier to forget...","To be honest, I never enjoyed the Shrek movies too much :all this efforts to subverts the Dysney's fairy tales codes seem a little hypocritical when you consider the endings and moral messages of the movies. They are in the end the exact childly and stupid ones than in an average recent Disney movie (ie : accept yourself as you are and you'll find love, the most important thing of all, and happiness...). And if one or two jokes were indeed funny, most of them are only parodies of other movies, put in another context. There's nothing new or original in that since ... hum, let's say the ZAZ movies ! But when it comes to the third movie, nothing of that doesn't really matters anymore, for everything in the movie (therefor everything that bothered me in the other ones) has already been told before and you just watch an unsurprising routine serial movie, easy to watch for you know it's universe and narrative codes quite well now. There's nothing new, but it's quite nice to meet all the characters again, with the feeling that my old arguments with them weren't so important after all."
293,Shrek the Third,4,26 July 2007,Downhill film that was the worst of the 2 shreks which were good,"Rubbish! Dead plot! Dumb new characters! Gay! My god, i really loved the two films but this was crap! In the film it was like this, shrek is going to be the king then Harold dies then Fiona says shes pregnant when shreks going for Arthur, he goes to a school, gets Arthur gets ambushed girls get kidnapped escape kick ass shrek gets to far far away donkey and puss has switch bodies shrek arrested shrek gets out with the girls then shrek kills Arthur has lots of babies then the end. Hopeless! Only a few plots but a crap film. Make more adventure, creatures, characters and movie be longer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is not happening, guys! this is retard work!"
294,Shrek the Third,4,24 July 2007,Shrek the Turd,"Hard to fathom why this film is such a clunker seeing as the previous 2 instalments were amusing enough.Maybe it's a case of familiarity breeding contempt.Celebrity casting for the sheer sake of it (cough) Justin Timberlake (cough) is also a sure sign of desperation as fans of ""Friends"" & ""Will & Grace"" will no doubt attest.Plus for a film with a relatively short run time ""Shrek the Third"" seemingly drags on for eons.Lengthy competitor for the pre-teen dollar ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" positively whizzes by in comparison.At least the end credits were funny and will no doubt add some much needed money to Sly Stone's depleted coffers.If the inevitable ""Shrek 4"" is of a similar standard though don't expect a cover version of ""There's a (laugh) Riot Going On""."
295,Shrek the Third,3,20 July 2007,Definitely not as good as the first two,"As other users have commented, the story has a weak plot and is just not funny. I actually didn't understand some parts of the plot such as why Arthur was angry with Shrek for lying to him that he was meant to be heir - not Arthur. Another bit i didn't understand was why Wostershire was a school. Surely its a county and therefore not small enough to be a school - I was wondering if there is some inter textual reference which i hadn't spotted but I'm not so sure. It could just be a random name picked for a school.Obviously there were some funny bits - but the directors didn't build on a lot of them. for example the queen smashing her head through a wall. that could have been so much more funny if more had been made of it.Overall i wouldn't recommend this film to those who enjoyed the first 2. i hope there isn't a fourth."
296,Shrek the Third,5,19 July 2007,"It's no 'Shrek' and cannot measure up to 'Shrek 2', and is obviously just Dreamworks' attempt to cash in on the franchise and make more millions","That was the real reason why I felt that ""Shrek the Third"" turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments in my time. The only reason why it was made was because Dreamworks studio had already made a fortune on the first and second Shrek movies, which were, and still are, very effective comedy movies that suit everybody in the entire family, which they were made to be. ""Shrek the Third"" was a rushed production and apparently no effort was put behind the screenplay to develop the new story, new characters, and I'm very sorry and regretful to say, the old characters that we had fallen in love with. The only real effort in the film that I myself could pick out was in the animation. The visuals are just as colorful and spectacular as the animation done in the first two films of the franchise. But as I've always said, you cannot judge a movie because it looks real or if it looks fake. Visual effects are only part of what can make an animated film work out. Especially when you work with films as complex and wonderful as the first two Shreks.""Shrek the Third"" has a major flaw in its structure that really makes it suitable only to very few audience members. That reason is that is a film that is not sure exactly what it wants to be and who it wants to satisfy. I'm sure the producers wanted it to be just like the first two Shrek films: a movie that will make all audience members of all ages proud. They want this film that the whole family can laugh at and have just the little kiddies being accompanied for its crude sense of humor. Unfortunately, this is what happens with ""Shrek the Third"". It becomes a film that will only suit the young kids, VERY young kids. It tries to be funny and humorous like the first two films, but the only jokes that come out are simple little ones that might make you grin once or twice, but only the kiddies will laugh. I only picked out one part of the film that made me laugh as I had with the first two Shrek films. A very brief part involving the character of Pinocchio.As I stated before, the screenplay does not develop the characters that we have come to know and love from ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"". This being Shrek, Donkey, Puss in Boots, Fiona, etc. Shrek is perhaps the only of the characters who is brought before us in the film as he should be. I'm not saying his humor is as effective, but just his attitude. He is still rude, angry, lazy, and an ogre. But the others don't really step forward to become effective and lovable. They are just there in the background trying to catch the audience's attention. Really, they become unnecessary to the plot. They were only needed to attract people to the theater. But both Donkey and Puss-in-Boots have lost their fantastic, almost humanlike traits that made us such incredible fans of them in the past. Donkey is no longer full of mindless and frantic antics, Puss-in-Boots is no longer wild and full of his old tricks, and so on and so forth. And to be frank, Prince Charming is not an effective villain in this movie. In the second film, he was this very sleazy supporting bad guy and now he tries to be the main baddie. But he lost his sleaze and tries to be too serious. It's like Lord Farquaad's personality combined with the Fairy Godmother's. Results: doesn't work. The dragon from the first movie is brought back from the original film, as are the half-breed children from the second, but what point are they to the film: just background again.And our course, as with most sequels, we get new supporting characters. How do they work out? Not at all. The character of Artie, I really say no point into being written into the storyline. What I was really expecting to see was that Artie was just some imaginary person to make Shrek go out and see his true responsibility for the kingdom. I was actually kind of hoping that was the case, for I was afraid that this Artie was going to turn out exactly as he did: pointless, harebrained (not funny), and just an in-the-background thing that could have been excised from the plot. Same thing goes with Merlin, who I was certain was going to turn up in the Shrek series at some point, being about the only magical being from fairy tales not into the franchise yet.Once you watch ""Shrek the Third"" and get it all down in your head, you realize that the only reason why it's not a complete disaster is because of the voice acting talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, and so on and so forth. I'm not saying their lines were funny, but they just kid of helped to boost the film up to being watchable. This film is mixed, confused about itself, and not what the studio really wanted the audience to take it as. They made it just to cash in on the franchise even more, but I'm sure they wanted the audiences to love it. This member of the audience didn't."
297,Shrek the Third,4,18 July 2007,Rubbish,"I think I've been pretty generous in giving this film a star for every time I laughed. The vast majority of the comedy is really lame, anyone can see the punch lines a mile off. The are two maybe three laugh out loud lines in the whole film. The storyline is pretty non existent and boring as hell. The graphical detail is absolutely crazy though. It looks like it cost an absolute bomb, looking at every thread on shrek's shirt covered in little bobbles of fluff and the hair on some of the characters is pretty mind blowing. However the film its self isn't funny and has no story. I'd say your better off going on youtube and watching the funny clips you can find, because there's not gonna be many and there's nothing else to see here.The funniest thing about this movie, is that Justin Timberlake actually has the voice of a 12 year old boy."
298,Shrek the Third,6,16 July 2007,"Too much Hype from the 1st and 2nd ones killed this movie,","I was a fan of the 1st and 2nd shrek, but the 3rd just didn't work for me. It wasn't funny, and actually the story wasn't that bad. The movie just failed to make me laugh. In the 2nd one the said they tried to hard to make it funny, but i thought it was just genius.They have announced shrek the 4th for 2010. So I'm hoping they can take a few years to make a comeback and show why the 1st and 2nd were classics. The main characters i still loved shrek, donkey, puss, e.t.c. This movie is meant to be for little kids and little kids enjoyed it, my little girl didn't stop laughing, Just goes to show that everyone has opinions from the smallest little girl or boy to the movie critics in the New York times! In the end, i stilled preferred it from other ""cartoon, Disney"" movies, but from a shrek fan stand point definitely disappointing."
299,Shrek the Third,6,16 July 2007,Shrek = Going Downhill?,"Shrek and Shrek 2 are one of Dreamworks' most successful animated films, and perhaps the only successful films to feature fairy tale elements combined with zany humor and a jar full of characters.Is Shrek the Third the next installment that I hope it would be good? STT may be a true sequel but it feels like a re-telling story of Shrek 2 with new characters and elements. Basically, Shrek is now King after Fiona's father died. But the bad thing is, he doesn't want to be a king and decides to find a perfect one. As Fiona reveals Shrek that she is pregnant, Shrek can't stop thinking about raising children as his adventure sets.The anti-heroic side? Prince Charming is going to take over Far Far Away after Shrek departs to find Arthur/Artie with a load of bad guys from various fairy tales. His goal is to execute Shrek to take over as the King.The whole film is very clichéd I have to admit. The pacing is much like the second one without the ho-hum searching for the next king, so there's not much variety in it.The humor is just like the other Shrek films. Pop culture infested jokes are in every scene including a number of inside jokes. Some may be good and some may be inspired. The Led Zeppelin bit was amusing but doesn't really suit the film. Funny how it is a brief cover of the Immigrant Song due to licensing issues. The weakest bit would be Shrek entertaining the audience as he tends to make non-graphic homosexual references to Charming's flamboyant image.Voice work is top-notch and a large cast of famous actors and actresses reprise their roles such as Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Some other famed stars with brief voice work include Eric Idle and Seth Rogen.The animation didn't age much, but a huge number of new environment settings did work out for the film.Overall, The Third was a decent sequel at its best yet forgettable. We still get more sequels and I hope they would live up to the first and the second film."
300,Shrek the Third,6,15 July 2007,"SHREK THE THIRD (Chris Miller and Raman Hui, 2007) **1/2","I had enjoyed the first Shrek film due to its novelty but was somewhat lukewarm towards the second; I'm even more so, then, with respect to this new entry. It's still eminently watchable for the gags, the in-jokes and the apparently unlimited possibilities of the CGI technique. The best new character is surely Eric Idle's accident-prone Merlin, while the most amusing sequences are those involving the Frog King's death and Shrek's nightmare about his upcoming parenthood. However, its gang of gung-ho fairy-tale heroines and the generally modern attitudes on display – to say nothing of the typically refurbished pop/rock songs on the soundtrack (including, of all things, Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song""!) – seem less intent on fulfilling the necessities of the plot than catering to potential box-office receipts!"
301,Shrek the Third,6,12 July 2007,Shrek 3 (2007),"I hate growing up, as this means all the movies and shows I used to love as kid now seem just crappy. Shrek is one of those.Now don't get me wrong, while Shrek does seem too immature for me now, it's still a funny and clever movie by any means. Same mostly goes for Shrek 2. Shrek 3 however is a different story.The story revolves around Shrek and Fiona taking over as King and Queenas Fiona's dad is sick. Shrek hopes he gets well soon, as he hates the duties of being King. Sadly, the king croaks and Shrek is heir. Refusing, he, donkey, and Puss n'Boots go out to find the next to the throne, nerd Artie (who looks like Corey Feldman to me). Meanwhile, Prince Charming has gathered a groups of evil Fairy Tale villains to take the throne. Not only that, but Shrek has to worry about fatherhood after Fiona tells him, she's pregnant.Now the plot is neither inspired or well-written as the previous. The whole Shrek-daddy connection is a waste (couldn't they wait for a sequel to flesh it out). Not to mention the whole villain's subplot is not as funny as the others (Lord Farquaad where are you).The jokes also seem to suffer. What made Shrek and Shrek 2 funny was it was able to bounce both kid and adult humor enough to be enjoyable for everyone. Sadly, the kid jokes come to often and the adult is too little. The whole Artie being such as nerd, even Dungeon & Dragons kids pick on him is just not funny. While the this made kids laugh out lot, Shrek having his ass scratched is pretty pathetic (I've never like butt jokes anyway).Despite these (many) flats, the movie still makes the grade as enjoyable for the family, yet never reaches the level of the others.But what difference does this make, even though the third is clearly the weakest, it's not the last. They're still going to make Shrek 4 and 5, a Christman special, and a spin-off (about Puss n'Boot, which has a some promise). The lack of quality well continue to drop and they'll just be more kid and fart jokes.Hopefully I'm wrong."
302,Shrek the Third,8,4 July 2007,not the best but better than other Dreamworks films,"Okay, so it's not better than the first two, but it's way better than crappy over the hedge or Madagascar. Seriously, so the film could have been a bit better, but who is seriously going to want to go to this the most??? THE KIDS not the adults. Everyone is rating this movie by adult standards. When you see it again with your kids try to look at it with a different eye. The humor is laugh out loud funny. I sat in the theater and laughed my head off. What were you expecting to see when you went to the movie theater? were you expecting some five star artistic movie? Did you bother checking the genre: kids, family? At least it was better than that no budget movie happily never after. All and all the movie wasn't the best, but it was funny and entertaining. See it ...... AGAIN."
303,Shrek the Third,7,1 July 2007,"Nowhere near the first two, but still a good film...","In the year of 2001, the relatively young studio DreamWorks released the animated film ""Shrek"", the movie that would finally consolidate them as a major player in the field of computer animation and as the main competition for Walt Disney Pictures. Loosely based on William Steig's 1990 children's book of the same name, ""Shrek"" was a highly original reworking of traditional fairy tales that took everyone by surprise with its fresh humor and extremely likable characters. Giving a twist to the classic concept of a princess locked in a tower by a dragon, ""Shrek"" had a grumpy ogre instead of handsome knight, a talkative donkey instead of dashing stallion, and a very down-to-earth princess with a dark secret. Obviously, the film's success prompted DreamWorks to make sequels, with part 2 appearing in 2004, and in 2007, ""Shrek the Third"".In ""Shrek the Third"", we find Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wife, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), living at the castle of Far Far Away as Fiona's father, King Harold (John Cleese) has fallen ill and Shrek must take his place. While not really happy about it, Shrek accepts hoping to return to his swamp as soon as the King recovers is health, but sadly, King Harold dies, leaving the grumpy ogre as heir to the throne. Not happy with the idea of ruling a country, Shrek decides to find the other heir: Fiona's cousin Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Together with his friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas), Shrek sails to his new adventure, but another unexpected event shocks the ogre: Fiona is pregnant. To make things worse, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) is back and is decided to conquer Far Far Away and destroy Shrek forever.Following the story that Andrew Adamson conceived for the planned sequels (apparently three sequels will be made), writers J. David Stem, David N. Weiss and Jon Zack join forces with script doctors Jeffrey Price and Peter s. Seaman, in an attempt to recapture the magic that made the first two ""Shrek"" movies a hit. Well, it could be said that they succeeded to a certain extent, as the movie still retains that wild anarchic humor that made the first one so fresh and interesting. While obviously lacking the novelty factor of the first one, the movie packs several great jokes surrounding Shrek's mid-life crisis and his doubts about paternity, as well as giving the ""Shrek touch"" to the Arthurian legend. As the other two films, this movie is also based around a life lesson, and while it's handled a little bit less subtle than in the other two, the writers manage to make it work fine.Chris Miller and Raman Hui (Animatiors of the first two ""Shrek"" films) are the ones now in the director's seat, and together they manage to build what's probably one of the best looking movies of the last years. As former animators, the two directors put a lot of care in the visual design of the film, making an extremely detailed film, with a very fluid animation and wonderful character design. It certainly looks like the crew at DreamWorks have certainly improved their craft, as ""Shrek the Third"" has probably the best CG animation in human beings done to date. Miller and Hui remain faithful to the ""Shrek"" style that Adamson created for the two films, so fans of the first two won't be disappointed by the looks of this film. The film flows at a nice pace, although one would prefer that the same care taken in the visual department had been taken in the development of the script.As usual, Mike Myers adds a lot of charm to the character, still making an excellent performance as the grumpy yet very lovable green monster, and this time he receives many of the best scenes too. As Donkey, Eddie Murphy keeps being hilarious, although since Shrek took the spotlight this time, Donkey's role is drastically reduced to mere companion together with Antonio Banderas' Puss-in-boots. As Puss, Banderas still steals every scene he is in, as unlike Murphy, his character did received a development this time. As Fiona, Cameron Diaz has less to do this time, but she still makes a solid performance. Finally, Ruppert Everett is delightful as the pathetic Prince Charming. In the supporting roles we find Julie Andrews and John Cleese reprising their roles as Fiona's parents in a good way, and Justin Timberlake and Eric Idle are nice additions to the cast.While ""Shrek the Third"" is by no means a bad film, those expecting something on the level of the previous installments of the franchise will be left a bit underwhelmed. While the lack of the surprise factor of the first two can be considered an important reason for this, the writers are not without fault. The main problem I see is that they have an enormous cast of likable characters to put on the film, and by trying to give each one of them a moment to shine the result is that many end up tragically underused, never reaching the full potential of what the writers intended them to be (Eric Idle's Merlin is the perfect example of this). Anyways, despite these problems the movie still works, mainly because the humor is still as wild and clever as usual, so fans of the series won't be disappointed in that aspect.While some may criticize the more mature nature of this movie (there's nothing inappropriate, but it's clear that more jokes are aimed to adults than to children), I think it fits perfectly within the ""Shrek"" universe, as even when the movie is quite popular with kids, it's target audience has always been those young adults who grew up with Disney's fairy tales. Those who didn't like the previous films won't find anything to make them change their mind, but those who loved them will find that the magic is still there. 7/10"
304,Shrek the Third,7,28 June 2007,Not that bad Cmon People,"Well Well Well. Do I hear the sounds of adults tongues wagging up and down trying to kick up a storm. Does one seem to forget we are talking about SHREK people, Yes a kids film to be marginally enjoyed by the older kids. If one gets dis heartened at watching a young child's face light up when their favourite character comes to life on the screen, then we live in a sad world. Therefore I would like to say that even this third installment is better than the second (only just). Why do we critisise the story that people want to put across ie POTC 3 is Gore's baby and should be respected. George Lucas (need I say more). Lets see a loud mouth here write a better four part installment of Shrek."
305,Shrek the Third,,28 June 2007,Gang Green.,"The third installment in the beloved ""Shrek"" series feels a bit tired and worn out, but it still entertains when all is finished. Our titled hero does not want to be king of Far Far Away after Fiona's father passes away so he attempts to find the late ruler's nephew instead with hilarious and outlandish results. While not quite as good as the first two, ""Shrek the Third"" delivers just what it promises: a good time at the movies. The animation and voice characterizations have always been the primary calling cards here. While the first ""Shrek"" was way over-rated, this one is truly under-rated. The series never promised to be the computer-generated animation answer to ""Citizen Kane"", but rather maybe the answer to something more in the line of the animated equivalent of ""Men in Black"". 4 stars out of 5."
306,Shrek the Third,5,24 June 2007,People like seconds..but not so much thirds,"Everyone knew that when Shrek the third was first released it would not live up to the great expectations of the first two.And so it proved.After watching it you don't really understand why the story and jokes were so silly and why the directors would go for something so lame.Sure kids may love it, but its not so much the 'fun for the whole family' genre that the first two were.So now i believe that many people will be posting the question 'What about Shrek 4?'I cant see it as being to good after watching this.All I can say is that it has to go back to the 'fun for the WHOLE family' aspect that the first two movies had or else it will be exactly like the third. This needed to be a lot better!"
307,Shrek the Third,8,24 June 2007,Absolutely hysterical but Shrek 2 is MUCH better,"I went to see Shrek 3 today (after fighting to get past real live donkeys at the cinema door!) and after watching it, my view is that this is a really funny movie and worth seeing. But Shrek 2 still remains the best of the trilogy, the cream of the crop.The plot is already described here on the IMDb so I won't rehash it. So let me tell you what I liked and disliked :Likes : 1. The frogs singing Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let Die"" at King Harold's funeral. 2. Donkey and Cat changing bodies with each other. 3.Everything to do with the cat. That animal just cracks me up. Every time he opens his mouth, I am on the floor. 4. King Harold dying - then not dying. The whole ""is he dead yet?"" routine was just freaking funny as hell. 5. Shrek changing a baby's nappy and, not looking at what he is doing, puts it on the cat instead. 6. Mr Merlin, the depressed crazy wizard in his short nightshirt and trendy sandals. 7. The cat and donkey acting as Shrek's agents, making sure he gets the right food in his dressing room to ""get in the right emotional state for his performance"". The Royal Guards refer them to ""Nancy in Human Resources""Dislikes :1. The cat and donkey getting less to say in the movie than in previous Shrek movies. These two are the prize assets in a Shrek movie and they were tragically underused and under-appreciated in this movie. 2. I thought the way Princess Fiona reversed the Charming situation at the end was a little rushed and too easily done. OK, this is Shrek, not ""War & Peace"" but in Shrek 2, they paced things out a bit more to make it last longer. Here, they just resolved everything in half the time.3. I absolutely hate Justin Timberlake!!!! I would have much preferred to see Shrek take the crown and become the new king.On the whole, this is definitely worth seeing but you'll be disappointed if you're looking for something that betters Shrek 2. Right now, part two really is, excuse the pun, King of the Castle."
308,Shrek the Third,8,22 June 2007,"It is Shrek the Third. It is great the third time too, but you have to consider that it is the third time.","It is definitely not the most rewarding task to do a third part of a flourishing movie. The audience is already used to several of the jokes, the characters as such are not fun in themselves (as they undoubtedly were in the first - and, the newer ones, in the second - movie), so saying that Shrek the Third is much worse than its predecessors is just simply not fair.It is a little bit worse, though. The main problem I would say is that they operate with so many characters, that you do not have the chance to learn to like, hate, or be afraid of them, respectively.Doris is my favorite new character by far.The girl-pack (Rapunzel & Co.) are also okay, but again, nobody gets more than one or two minutes screening time- that is not enough to develop or show a character you can find cool. Also, the scene where King Harold dies (several times) - well, I am not easily offended, but that was a bit of a stretch.Apart from that, there is a lot of stuff to laugh on and enjoy, the story is a decent (but again, not well-elaborated) parody of the Harry Potter and King Arthur sagas, the part where Pinocchio is interrogated is a gem (did you catch before that the same guy is doing the voice for Pinocchio and the piggies?), and so is the escape of the ladies from their prison.Everybody you liked is here, including the Gingerbread Man, the Wolf, and of course the Donkey and Puss and the rest. the nanny dwarf is just sooo cool. The story is mainly centered around Shrek trying to get back to the beginning of Shrek No. 1 - with one addition, Fiona- and have his peace in his swamp. Meanwhile, he has to find a new king to replace him, get acquainted with the fact that he is to become a dad, and try to save Far Far Away from Prince Charming and those, who never had a happily ever after before. Quite a lot to do there! The animation and the technicalities of the background reminded me of fabulous old Walt Disney backgrounds, they were so well-done. if you compare the technique with that of part 1 - well, the development in such a short time is amazing. I think that it is unfair to go to a third part of a series and expect that the original characters for whom you have gone there have been completely reinvented so that you get the same thrill as you did the first time. The magic of newness is natural to fade.So - there is quite a decent amount of laughter you can get from Shrek the Third. Go see the movie and enjoy it as I did."
309,Shrek the Third,7,8 June 2007,It's not that bad...,"I've just watched Shrek 3 a few hours ago & I kind of beg to differ from what the rest of people feel. In fact, I find it more light-hearted than Shrek 2 which tried a bit too hard with all its sarcasm. Shrek 3 had plenty of laughs & I was pretty thrilled by the creativity of the whole movie.I loved how the princesses worked together! It looked almost like a scene from Charlie's Angels when they ripped off their sleeves to get ready to fight..Of course nothing beats the original installment but it's still worth a watch. I think some of the values in it are pretty cool too...it's a good show to bring your children to watch & for adults, just a nice show to relax & laugh after a long day's work.."
310,Shrek the Third,8,3 June 2007,Surprisingly......Pretty Good,"I work at a movie theater and I was told by some people that it was OK and and told by others that it was really bad. I decided to one day come and see it and I really liked it. I wasn't expecting a movie as good as this one. Sure like any sequel's case it isn't as good as the first one, but come on it wasn't terrible. The characters were good and the plot was exciting.However I do not like how this film has spoofed logos of modern companies (ie Ye Olde Footlocker) and the Hooters. I do not particularly for those parts of these films. I guess now they are making another one but i don't know if they will after getting such a negative response from people. I do think that after the fourth one (if there is one) that they should end it.Over all not bad at all"
311,Shrek the Third,6,2 June 2007,"Not in measure of the first two, but still fun...","Like millions of other viewers, I absolutely loved the first two Shrek films. With the magic that the first two films held, I dearly wanted to see the third one despite the negative reviews I have read about it. And after seeing it, I don't necessarily agree with the ""bashing reviews"", nor do I call this Shrek in measure of the first two films.Story wise it doesn't too bad. It didn't have a strong storyline as did the first two, but it was no disappointment. In fact, I found it quite humorous like the previous films. It basically picks up from the second film, of where King Harold the Frog of Far Far Away dies, and Shrek is the next in line for being king. Once again, Shrek is in a situation he doesn't want to be part of, and the only alternative of him not being king is to find the other heir in line, Arthur or ""Artie"". As this happens, Prince Charming decides to make a ""happily after"" for himself and the other unhappily after characters by invading Far Far Away.Yet again, the unforgettable characters such as: Donkey, Puss n Boots, Fiona, Shrek, and many other protagonist characters flourish on the big screen, which was very pleasing. There are also a couple of new faces, including Merlin and Arthur. The voice of Merlin by Eric Idle was simply comic genius, giving me memories of his Monty Python humor (which was quite a bit in the film). But the voice of Arthur or Artie by Justin Timberlake was feeble. I'm not a fan of his, and to be brutally honest, his voice is not meant to be in an animated film like Shrek. It just wasn't animated or humorous like the works of the other cast, including: Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, or even Antonio Banderas.The other problem I had with this film was that it wasn't as comical as the first two. It didn't have the ridiculous sight gags or fantasy satire like the previous two. And even worse, there was some humor in it that I found very inappropriate for a PG film, including many sexual innuendos and other related things. When I was in the theater loaded with children, I didn't hear a lot of laughter from them.Instead, they began talking through the film out of boredom. Bottom line, it was fun, but not in measure of the first two films. 7/10 Note to Parents: This may not be a movie for your kids if they are under the ages of eight. I suggest you see this movie ahead of time, and see if you think it is appropriate for them."
312,Shrek the Third,6,2 June 2007,Didn't really care about this one.,"Stars: Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, Larry King, Amy Poehler, Cheri O'Terri, Eric Idle, Regis Philbin, John Cleese.This Shrek started out promisingly enough, but kind of fell flat. For some reason, this felt more like a television episode than a movie. However with that said, it still had enough fun moments to keep it afloat. The plot of this one is Shrek and Fiona are going to have kids. Shrek looks for a replacement king for Fiona's father, and travels to a high school to meet Arthur (Timberlake). Prince Charming and his bad guy goons take over the castle. All 3 plots are strung together to make the plot very diluted. One problem with this movie, is unlike the first two, it just didn't feel epic. It barely even felt like a fairy tale. The characters were also underused, including Donkey and Puss in Boots being there only to spout out one liners for no reason. Nonetheless though, it was fairly entertaining throughout, and most kids won't notice that this isn't at the level of the first, or even the second.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 84 mins. PG for crude humor and drug references."
313,Shrek the Third,8,28 May 2007,Third Time is nearly Charming's - but Shrek returns the King!,"I have a direct connection to the movie, I had the privilege of interviewing John Cleese in late December 2004, he had just completed his part for the movie and was resting here in Barbados! Obviously, the digital animation takes longer than the voicing for the project! It is so sad therefore to see what a small role he played in Shrek The Third, but it was hilarious for a prolonged death scene - only Dreamworks can pull that off and make you smirk! This movie finds Shrek having the duties of royalty foisted on him, when all he wants to do is be in his swamp with Fiona - yet even if he heads back there, he finds another surprise... Fatherhood! On an aside to the real world and not part of Cinema yet related - why do those who don't want kids have them out of their ears and those who want a brood have to wait so long? If Puss Y-Boots is not careful, he'll be a daddy too many times over! Loved his farewell scene with all of the female cats, what a viejo salsito Tomas or saucy old tom; ""You I do not know, but would not mind to get to know"" Donkey is easily a very happy dad with five fire-breathing baby-burros! So the trio go and look for Arthur, the replacement for Shrek as King... This character is voiced by Justin Timberlake (ironic, as he is the ""ex"" of Fiona's voice, Cameron Diaz) and it seems he is a dorky teen! The Worcestershire College he attends (pronounced ""Wuss-ter"" BTW) is a mix between Beverley Hills 90210 and Gilmore Girls, Shrek thought Lancelot as the handsome successful knight was the dude he's looking for - but unfortunately, Arthur just finished playing a quintain, or jousting dummy, for the same Lancelot! At first Artie, as he likes to be called, looks at Kingship as giving orders and being pampered until Donkey inadvertently reveals the true responsibility of ruling a land.It takes his former teacher Mr Merlin to try and get him to realise his true calling and even what Shrek must acknowledge as being a parent! Meanwhile, Charming - as sneaky a cad as ever thanks to Rupert Everett - is plotting with the more modern fairy tale characters to pull a coup on Far Far Away. Hook from James Barrie plus the Grimm Brothers' Rumpelstiltskin and the talking trees which feature in many tales...This I hope is a portent that other genres can be explored like Anansi from the Caribbean (A telephone operator or pizza-baker?) or Paul Bunyan from the US (Reduced to replacing lightbulbs in streetlamps?) or even the steeplejack from Britain (Is he a portable chimney weep?)! This means there can be at least another two Shrek pics if you include Fiona's pregnancy! Eventually after being nearly jailed thanks to Rapunzel, Fiona with the other Fairy Tale Sistas (Snow White, Cinderella, Fiona's Mom the Queen as delivered by Dame Julie Andrews plus Sleeping Beauty) battle the Palace Guards! Snow White via song controls animals; Cinderella knocks the spit out of guards with her glass slippers but the classic is Sleeping Beauty who literally FALLS asleep and knocks henchmen out like ninepins! Does Shrek get back in time? Does Artie accept that with Great Power Comes Great Responsibility? What about Fiona? Is it a boy or girl or both? Here's a silly hint - remember the digital animated feature's title..."
314,Shrek the Third,5,26 May 2007,Very Average,"Well if you liked the first movies you will probably like this movie only watch it once. The movie has no adventure and Justin Timberlake isn't good at all. Myers and Diaz are average like they always are in movies. But it isn't all bad, Antonio and Eddie save the film from the cellars. But Timberlake wasn't ready for the movies, his voice sounded awful on the screen, not a great plot no comedy i probably laughed 4 to 5 laughs honest, and no adventure, Diaz and Myers were better than average like they always are, and Eddie and Antonio were great to salvage the movie a 5.7 out of 10. Not even close to the first 2 movies please don't make a shrek 4 don't ruin your great movies in the 00's. If Toy Story 3 is just good or below than the shrek will take the ultimate animated films but toy story will be good or above so shrek comes in 2nd. Check out toy story 3 in 2010."
315,Shrek the Third,6,25 May 2007,Shrek the Third: The third and hopefully final installment,"From the start I laughed, but I could sense that this film wasn't going to live up to the charm or the brilliance of the first two films. I liked the storyline and the references made back to the first 2 films. I also liked the pop soundtrack and the ending musical number that has become a tradition in the Shrek series, as well as the high school sequence. ""Just say nay"". Classic. Unfortunately there were a number of elements I disliked. The first and probably the sequence I hated the most was Harold's death scene. The first time he ""croaked"" was funny. The next two or three times just made it annoying and I was hoping he had croaked for real. The second were the other princesses. The satirical elements of their character was funny, but overall they just annoyed me. Third, Eric Idle. Usually I find him to be riotous, but in this film his jokes just weren't clever nor hilariously stupid. They were just dumb. Last, but most certainly not least, Charming's singing. He puts the failures on the American Idol auditions to shame. Overall this film is worth seeing, especially if you've seen the first two, but I wouldn't watch it twice. Also try to see it w/ someone special. Gives you less reason to leave, even though you want to while watching it."
316,Shrek the Third,5,23 May 2007,rent it,I love the Shrek movies I own 1&2 so Ilove this series and i'm sad to say that unless you go with friends and make fun of it it won't be worth it sure there are some pretty funny parts but not enough to recommend I suggest you wait till its on DVD so you pay a couple a bucks to rent it however if the first day you saw Shrek you said I will buy this whole franchise then your a freak no i'm kidding but if your that devoted to the Shrek franchise than buy it the part I recommend the most is the led zeppelin part cause its snow white singing zeppelin but honestly the funniest people in the movie were the princesses and not the lovable characters that made this franchise funny in the first place so in conclusion rent it PLEASE I'M BEGGING YOU
317,Shrek the Third,6,23 May 2007,Tries to cram a 2 hour movie into 90 minutes,"I love Shrek. My daughter and I saw the first one in the theater 5 times. And it took me a while to come around, but I really like the second one. This installment had so much potential, but its biggest failure is the attempt to do way too much in too little time.Is it funny? Mostly. Are there lovable characters, old and new? Yes. But the writers decided to split up Fiona and Shrek, devoting about 45 minutes to Shrek, 35 to Fiona, and 10 to the bad guys. The plot felt very rushed. I know kids have a short attention span and it's time consuming to animate a CGI movie, but the movie would have certainly benefited from more time - about 30 minutes more. And they could have cut the entire high school scene. It was stupid and pointless.That being said, the babies - ogre and dragon/donkey - were adorable. Snow White - brilliant. The disclosure of where Fiona got her fighting skills was hilarious. Eric Idle and John Cleese were terrific, as were Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy. The movie is worth seeing, just not 5 times."
318,Shrek the Third,,22 May 2007,doesn't cover much new ground but you at least want to like it,"When the beloved King Harold falls gravely ill, lovable ogre and son-in-law Shrek is chosen as rightful heir to the throne. Not wanting to accept the responsibility of royalty, Shrek journeys to find Arthur, a hapless young knight and only suitable candidate to take on the role. Meanwhile, the pompous Prince Charming rallies a group of vindictive outcasts to try and conquer Far Away Land and get what he views as his fitfully 'happy ending.' Third entry in the witty animated series is likable and pleasant but never transcends its seen-it-all before aura; there are some laughs here and there, and plenty of zany, iconic characters, but not enough fresh ideas, innovative gags, or new plot twists. Sidekick Donkey's banter is forced and only mildly funny, and companion Puss-in-Boots is sorely underused. The film is redeemed to a surprising avail by the appeal of Shrek, but he can only carry this protracted premise so far; engaging enough for kids, strained and predictable for adults. **"
319,Shrek the Third,6,21 May 2007,"Same old Shrek, for better or worse","Shrek the Third reviewed by Samuel OsbornSilly green ogres apparently apply to the mantra, ""Some things never change."" Shrek has returned for his third outing, garbed in all the same bells and whistles that made the previous two episodes go down all fuzzy and easy. It's a nursery rhyme told in the time signature of a Top 100 pop song: clean and catchy, cute and simple, clever and empty. What worked in the first was segued to the second. And what worked in the second was bridged to the third. It's a continuation and a repeat effort, showcasing little more than hollow gumption towards the usage of puns, scatological gags, referential pop culture digs, and the successful artistry of a million well-positioned pixels. The pill goes down easy and the magic it works is enjoyable enough. But its luster has gone and the originality flattened. Like I said, some things never change. Shrek is still Shrek. But how long until that charm dims? After marrying the princess and meeting the parents, Shrek (Mike Meyers) is now asked to be king. Far Far Away has lost its toad ruler (John Cleese) and the next in the royal line is our fat green ogre. Declining the offer on terms of being horribly unqualified for the job, Shrek is informed that after himself, a boy named Arthur (Justin Timberlake) is due to be king. I guess the list of Grimm and Disney characters to spoof had worn thin, requiring the Shrek writing-team to dig into Arthurian lore. Such myth is applied to the world of medieval high school, with Arthur (here known as Artie) playing victim to Lancelot's (John Krasinski) muscled jock glory. Guinevere (Latifa Ouaou) plays a cheerleader; the sort of girl whose vocabulary consists of ""whatever"" and ""totally."" In the shadowy background lurks Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), bitter about having lost his shot at the throne, now rallying the villains of the fairy tale kingdom for a final showdown between the palace walls of Far Far Away. The Shrek franchise has never been one for sincerity. Its shtick is the sly punch-line; the clever in-joke that only the adults get. With its for-the-whole-family-humor and animated renditions of popular rock tunes, Shrek spreads the vulture wings of a massive demographic, mainstreaming itself for mass consumption. Here the tactic is most obviously at play. Sincerity is wholly lacking in its empty story, which plays most like the spoof of a Greatest Hits mix tape of fairy tale characters. There's a point when Snow Whitein the Shrek world, an obnoxious, caddy brunettesings the original tune from the classic Disney picture. The old recording, scratchy and ancient, is used, reminding us of the sweetness and simplicity of those pictures. Animation didn't used to be so sly, so impatient for the next joke. Shrek is fine, all three episodes of it. It's fun, colorful and bouncily easy to digest. Filled with fiber, let's say. But it has all the viscosity of a stand-up routine. The story itself means nothing, let alone the characters. It's the jokes hidden inside, tucked in all the shadows, that matter. Shrek the Third, as Guinevere would say ""is, like, so totally whatever.""Samuel Osborn"
320,Shrek the Third,6,21 May 2007,Honestly...they could have stuck with just the two...,"First off the bat, I loved ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"", so naturally I went to see this one with high hopes that it would live up to it's amazing predecessors, I was ultimately disappointed. It seemed like the premise could have worked, but the script writing process seemed rushed and the product itself seemed vague and unorganized. It wasn't as humorous as the other two had been, less adult jokes that the parents and young adults in the theater can truly laugh out loud with. In the other films they had a great balance of the two, not so in this one. Also they seemed to try to hard for the adults to get a laugh, using ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Immigrant Song"" to spark some sort of chuckle with us, but the result just didn't work for me. Small children will probably end up liking it, but for the adults looking for the same humor as that was in the first two, you may be disappointed. There was very little character development of new characters and this time around Shrek might have well dressed up in a baby polar bear or panda costume and begin dancing around, he was least like an ogre and more like Ozzy Osmund than he ever has been."
321,Shrek the Third,7,21 May 2007,Underwelming addition to the promising animated franchise,"SHREK THE THIRD (2007) **1/2 (VOICES OF : Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Justin Timberlake, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Eric Idle, Larry King, John Krasinki, Ian McShane, Cheri Oteri, Regis Philbin, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Amy Sedaris, Seth Rogen.) Underwhelming addition to the animated franchise this time with the ogre Shrek facing impending parenthood with his beloved Princess Fiona and attempting to persuade cousin Artie to take the rightful place on the throne in spite of Prince Charming's nefarious plans to rule Far, Far Away. While the animation is splendidly gorgeous as usual there are too many characters given little to do and the main characters seeming to just be going through the motions. Overall not terrible but the weakest entry to date for the promising trilogy. (Dirs: Chris Miller and Raman Hui)"
322,Shrek the Third,7,18 May 2007,"Not great, but still decent-MINOR SPOILERS","This is still a good kid's movie, but by the third go-around the adults will surely grow tired of this rehash of the first two movies. They took all the good elements from each of the first two movies and blended them together, such as Puss in Boots' ""cute eyes"" trick as well as spells gone haywire (Donkey becomes Puss and vice versa); also when the princesses team up and all know how to fight, a la Fiona in the first movie. The humor is pretty much gone, which is a shame because of the great potential from the vocal talent. This was Justin Timberlake's worst acting job so far (and yes, I am among the few that think he's not a bad actor), and it required the least out of him (just to read a script) but it seemed like he phoned it in. Andrew Adamson did well to stay away from the director's chair of this one, even though he did exec. produce it or something, because it is by far the worst of the three.Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10-because it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either."
323,Shrek the Third,7,19 May 2007,Shrek the Third is pretty entertaining for another sequel,"When I saw the previews for Shrek the Third, part of me felt a little of the ""been there, done that"" emotion simply because, having enjoyed the first two Shrek films with the constant pop-culture references and turning clichés upside down, I felt the plot of this one give the vibe of predictability. The movie, however, made the most of advancing the characters to some kind of maturity that seemed, for the most part, natural. Like the title character's impending fatherhood and his nightmare version of it that parodies Rosemary's Baby. Or Shrek's wisecracks and wisdom that surfaces during the spoofs of overblown Broadway musicals. I loved Eric Idle as an aged Merlin and Shrek's heart-to-heart with Arthur that had the beginning of ""That's What Friends Are For"" playing. Also loved the body switches of Donkey and Puss-in-Boots and seeing the other fairy-tale princess in kick butt mode. So while not as hilarious as the first two Shrek films, this third one is still entertaining enough for me to recommend to the whole family. And stay for the ""Thank For Letten Me Be Mice Elf Agin"" sequence during the credits. Thanks, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett, Larry King, Regis Philbin, Amy Poehler, Amy Sedaris, Cheri Oteri, Maya Rudolph, Eric Idle, Justin Timberlake and all the other voices for making Shrek the Third as entertaining as possible!"
324,Shrek the Third,6,19 May 2007,Disappointment,"I have always enjoyed the shrek movies but this one was so formulated I couldn't enjoy it. There were too many over the top antics, forced jokes, and the plot was thin. There was a sort of magic missing from this shrek that the others have. The character development was shallow and rushed. This movie in no way deserves a 10/10, which I was surprised to see it receive from so many others. It wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but it is definitely a renter. I will most likely not see the 4th one in the theatres...just because it is a Shrek movie doesn't mean it is going to be good...unfortunately. I guess I will just have to enjoy the old shreks from my DVDs."
