0,Shrek Forever After,8,10 December 2010,Underrated Animation,"On the day that Shrek rescued the cursed Princess Fiona from the tower where she was kept prisoner of the dragon, her parents King Harold and the Queen were ready to sign a contract with the cunning Rumpelstiltskin delivering the kingdom Far Far Away to him. On the present days, Shrek feels bored with Fiona, his family and friends and near a breakdown, and he misses the years when he was a terrifying ogre. Rumpelstiltskin overhears a discussion between Shrek and Fiona and meets Shrek, offering a deal to make he feels a frightening ogre again. In return, Shrek should deliver one day of his childhood to Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek is lured and Far Far Away is distorted under the reign of the tricky Rumpelstiltskin. Now Shrek misses his family and friends and has to win Fiona's heart again to save Far Far Away, his friends and himself. I have just watched ""Shrek Forever After"" and my expectations were very low, based on the IMDb user's rating and a couple of reviews that I had glanced. However I liked this underrated animation a lot, which has a good story with many hilarious moments. Once again, Donkey ""steals the movie"" and this character has been for years the best role of the wasted Eddy Murphy. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Shrek para Sempre"" (""Shrek Forever After"")"
1,Shrek Forever After,7,5 May 2010,Didn't capture the magic of the first two. But better than the 3rd Installment.,"I saw ""Shrek Forever After"" on special screenings and I really hoped it would live up to the first 2 films. But at the end of the day, it wasn't as good or magical. I kind of felt disappointed because even though the Third Installment was bad I was hoping they went back and recognize their mistakes. But this movie does have its strong points, it was quite funny and entertaining. There were moments in there that felt like the first two films, and overall it is a very enjoyable ride that even though it doesn't live quite up to the first two films. It is worth your money just to have fun with it.7.2/10 I'd recommend people to see this film, but don't go in it with HIGH expectations."
2,Shrek Forever After,7,17 July 2010,"Nowehere near the level of quality from the first and second films, but entertaining","Almost a decade ago, the film Shrek left many people amazed (including me) with its extraordinary animation and a hilarious parody of some famous fairy-tales (specially the Disney interpretations of them), without neglecting the creation of memorable characters and honest emotions.Shrek 2 was also excellent, but it was a bit below the level from the first film.Then, in 2007, Shrek the Third was a desperate attempt to have the magic from the first two films; the result was mediocre, and a big declination from the first two films.Now, we have Shrek Forever After, and even though it is far from reaching the level from Shrek 1 and 2, it kept me entertained, and I think it represents an improvement on the third film.What I mostly liked from Shrek Forever After is that screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke followed the evolution from Shrek in a natural way.In the first film, we saw the change in Shrek's life when he first fell in love; in the second one, he had to face the responsibilities from adult life; in the third one, he faced the insecurities of the paternity; and now, the ogre feels overwhelmed by the family routine and he misses the liberty from his youth, which is a subject that is a bit more mature to what we are accustomed to see on an animated film.However, I found various fails in Shrek Forever After, specially in the fact that the screenplay is not very ingenious.Its handling of the humor keeps being based on songs, characters and events from popular culture, but that does not feel as fresh and irreverent as it had felt on the first Shrek; in fact it feels a bit tiring now, because of the large number of animated films which have used that strategy.However, there are good moments of humor in the interaction between the characters; I particularly liked the character of Puss in Boots; most of the laughs I had while watching this movie came from that character.Good work, Antonio Banderas.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about Eddie Murphy, one of my favorite comedians, whose contribution to the other movies had been among the best elements from them.However, I felt his voice acting in Shrek Forever After to be forced and listless.The rest of the cast made a decent work, but nobody particularly stood out.But the whole experience from Shrek Forever After is not highly memorable, and one of the best things I can say about it is that it avoided to fall into some irritating mistakes from the third film (even though that does not exempt it to have its own fails).However, I think I can recommend Shrek Forever After because it kept me entertained...however, it is very far away from reaching the magic from the first two films."
3,Shrek Forever After,7,9 July 2010,"A Good Fun Fairytale For The Family, and An End To A Saga","Well it was bound to happen, most animation saga's or trilogy's end eventually and some better than others. With Shrek Forever After this is the case, still packed full of gags, funny moments and hilarious one liners its a good end to a fun enjoyable franchise. We all hoped it would also end this way, in a positive way as the last 11 years has been Shrek sequels some better than others. With this final adventure, old characters are reunited and new ones enter the fray.Plus we also get a fresh new setting for this latest and final tale, some good dialogue too and of course improved animation. Considering this was always gonna go up against Toy Story 3, we knew it would be a close fight for the throne of the summer blockbuster. Otherwise, however Shrek Forever After has done a good job of grabbing it for me until I see Toy Story 3, until then I believe this is the best animation summer blockbuster of the year.If you want quick gags, laughs and family fun Shrek Forever After is for you and also for fans of the franchise."
4,Shrek Forever After,6,21 May 2010,"An entertaining diversion, even if the series is no longer magical","After three films of diminishing quality, more than anything, Shrek Forever After begs the obvious question: why? Unfortunately the answer is also all too obvious with the franchise having grossed one billion dollars domestically and oodles more overseas. For what it's worth, this instalment is better than the last but fails to hold a candle to Shrek 2 and pales to the point of apparition when compared to the original.The characters that populate the ""Shrek"" universe remain as endearing as ever in principle, but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated, so to speak. That is why it comes as no surprise that the plot of this film has the mythical land of Far Far Away being turned on its head by the devious Rumplestiltskin, morphing all familiarity into a bizzaro world of sort, and I'll admit, it does add an iota of charm to the proceedings. Shrek (Mike Myers) finds himself tired of family life with his ogre wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and longs for his bachelor days of terrifying townsfolk and signs a contract with 'Rumple' as he is less than affectionately called. Things don't turn out nearly as he imagined and Shrek must fulfil a loophole in the contract to turn things back to the way they were.The original gang all return along with Shrek and Fiona. We have the swashbuckling Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), the chatty Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Julie Andrews and John Cleese as the Queen and King respectively. There are also a number of celebrity voice cameos including Larry King and Regis Philbin and all add up to a lively time at the movies. In the movies defence, the lack of freshness never translates to boredom.The biggest issue with Shrek the Third was the weak attempt to inflate the voice cast, making things more monotonous yet. DreamWorks has clearly learned from this mistake and in addition to tweaking the familiar character's personas in this alternate reality, find a decent villain in Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn) along with great comedians the likes of Craig Robinson and Jane Lynch. The animation is as stellar as ever and it never ceases to amaze how lifelike a film can look that has a talking donkey at its center.What makes this descendant of Shrek somewhat distinguishable is that it presents itself more as homage then adhering to the spoof ideology that characterized the others. Shrek Forever After is part Aladdin, part Bedazzled and more than a sprinkle of It's a Wonderful Life. There are also many more laughs in this film than the previous, and can often be attributed to site gags sprung from the new universe (an obese Puss in Boots provokes more than a few guffaws).What everyone has to remember, first and foremost, is that the ""Shrek"" franchise is meant for children and I don't believe any of the four instalments could disappoint an eight year old. It is the accompanying adults that need to be wary of the growing tedium in the franchise, but thanks to a plethora of talented actors and a significantly more satisfying storyline, Shrek Forever After makes for an entertaining diversion, even if it's no longer magical."
5,Shrek Forever After,7,20 May 2010,Shrek 4: A Flawed Comedy but a Perfect Final Chapter,"When I found out that a fourth Shrek movie was being made, it made me frown because it seemed pretty needless, especially that the last movie was such a bore. But then again, if you take the storyline into consideration, this becomes a fitting final chapter to formally close the Shrek series. The movie is originally entitled SHREK FOREVER AFTER, but in other regions of the world including ours, it is entitled SHREK: THE FINAL CHAPTER, so it's obvious.First we go to the more unpleasant aspects; this movie works more as a fantasy-adventure movie rather than a comedy. That's because the humor factor of Shrek has gone old already. This movie seems to squeeze the very last drop of what is left of the Shrek series' dried out desert of humor. Sure, it may make us give out a chuckle here, a chuckle there, but this Shrek movie cannot make us laugh out loud anymore. When you look back at its title ""Shrek the Final Chapter"" you would realize that this movie does seem to apologize with the fact that this'll be the last and probably an admission that they could not squeeze any more decent thing out of the Shrek saga after this one; it's a final effort to make one last buck.On the other hand, Shrek's main story aspect is a little more interesting than its humor. As I said earlier, this movie is better as a fantasy adventure because we do get to see an alternate reality where Shrek is back into being an outcast Ogre and everybody else who was originally part of his circle of friends has not met him yet. Eventually, they get into an adventure wherein he must face a new enemy, a new problem, and he even gets to meet other ogres and an ogre resistance army that pretty much reminded me of Warcraft (the old-school Warcraft 2 to be exact). In this bizarro world, Donkey has not met him, Puss has become obese, and Fiona is the leader of the Ogre resistance. Shrek must go through this alternate universe and survive it before the day passes and a curse will consume him for good. Shrek gets to have some action with a horde of witches and must face the dragon once again. I could not say that the action was impressive but it has its little cool moments. I particularly loved the chain skull weapons that the witches use.In addition, this movie works also as a family domestic drama where it maturely deals with the simple family issue of boredom and being sick of how repetitious family life can be. I daresay that the film can work as a satire or perhaps a metaphor that some married men can learn from. There is one sequence in the movie that does capture this crisis; I am talking about the scenes where we see Shrek realize that despite the fact that he does live a happy life, it can get pretty dull and annoying at times, but then again that's life.Perhaps it becomes boring because many of us choose not to grow up; many of us choose to not let go of what our past lives were. That is what happens to Shrek in this movie. To escape the mediocrity of a family life, he wishes to relive the moments when he was still just a normal ogre again. And because of this, he puts his family life in jeopardy. Shrek 4's tale comes full circle in the sense that it questions if Shrek did have a ""happily ever after"" ending in the past three movies, and puts one last fantastic circumstance to let him live out a reality that this never happened.And lastly, Shrek 4's main potential lies in its romance. With an alternate reality story, Shrek faces a Fiona that has never met him. Therefore, Shrek must find out some way to make Fiona fall in love with him all over again. If you ask me, the romantic aspect of this movie is as innovative as the first Shrek movie, in ways that it tells mature subject matter in the guise of fantasy. The Fiona of the alternate reality mirrors the plight of women who gave up on romance, and one scene certainly negates the falsity of most fairy tales with a line that goes something like: ""a mere kiss does not solve everything"" It negates other fantasies like ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Snow White"" because it destroys the superficial aspect of those obsolete fairy tales with a more realistic approach, because indeed, a kiss is nothing if there is no true love that goes with it. In my opinion, Shrek 4 succeeds in this aspect.Shrek may not be the best movie this summer, or it might not be the funniest Shrek movie, but it certainly is one that is very rich story-wise. Just as his line in the first movie went ""I have layers"" and there certainly are deeper layers to this story rather than one that will just make you laugh. Of course, this works out as a great family movie, but it is certainly perfect for couples, most especially married couples, and parents alike. I give SHREK FOREVER AFTER a.k.a. SHREK: THE FINAL CHAPTER a Matinée rating for single serving; and a Full Price rating for family servings."
6,Shrek Forever After,7,11 June 2010,"As happily ever after's go, this one ain't half bad.","The final chapter in the SHREK series recalls that familiar term ""Be careful what you with for"". I too was careful at what I wished SHREK FOREVER AFTER would be. After the disappointing SHREK THE THIRD, the bar isn't set high for this supposedly final chapter. It's never going to compare with the superior first two, but if Dreamworks Animation really wanted to conclude their beloved property with this, they might as well give it all that it has. SHREK FOREVER AFTER, while certainly more elaborate than its immediate predecessor, is not the most original of the series, but if this is really a happily ever after for Shrek, at least he went out on a good note rather than a disappointing one.The story is basically IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) trading places with George Bailey. Shrek's life couldn't be better: he has his loving wife Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) and three kids, best buddies Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) are current visitors, he's got his swamp back, and above all his days as the flesh-eating ogre are way behind him. But everyday of the same day-to-day rituals can get too routine for our big green ogre. If only he could wish he could be that flesh-eating ogre again! His wish is granted when he meets the crafty Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Walt Dohrn), but it at a terrible catch. Before you can say ""Happily Ever After no more!"", Shrek is trapped in a depressing alternate universe where he was never born and none of his pals know who he is.The real treat of the premise of FOREVER AFTER is that it gives us a chance to warm up with these characters again and recall why we loved them in the first place, and then find out a few new reasons to like them all over again. We already know these characters and we have met them before, and this might just serve as a reunion after the occasional slog of the previous follow-up. Unlike its immediate predecessor as well, this one actual has a storyline instead of the simple premise to be used to hang pop culture reference and in-jokes. It's not a great storyline and certainly not anything original, but it's a step on the right direction. Director Mike Mitchell has at least put Shrek right back on track, and not a moment too soon. If this is really the series' finale, the creators have at least done a credible job at reminding us of the appeal that these characters. In a way, SHREK FOREVER AFTER is a satisfying conclusion, if not a grand one.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
7,Shrek Forever After,9,10 July 2010,James Stewart's '' It's a wonderful life'' meets Shrek,"I went to see this film last night (FRIDAY 9th July 2010) and laughed out loud for the first time in heaven knows how long.I thought the animation and personification of the characters, facial expressions were far better than any film made recently .Walt Dohrn, as Rumplestilskin had a suitably peevish and vindictive expression to his voice. While all the other usual cast were well on form.There was as always a moral to the story and Shrek's philosophical reflection to Fiona at the end cleverly turns the tables on our previous ideas of the film .This is far better than Shrek 3, a laugh out loud film that does n't fail to deliver a feel-good response . It 's a James Stewart 'It's a wonderful life' meets Shrek. Loved it ."
8,Shrek Forever After,7,10 June 2010,"""Shrek Ever After"" ends the franchise with some dignity.","I really enjoyed the first ""Shrek"" film back in 2001 and was an even bigger fan of ""Shrek 2,"" which came out just three short years later. Then ""Shrek the Third"" hit theaters and I couldn't believe what I was watching. Not only did the third film have a horrible story but the charm and wit of all the original characters was gone. I was actually angry that I paid money to see the third film and really didn't want anything to do with the ""Shrek"" franchise any longer. To my surprise even after hearing nothing but complaints about the third one, the final chapter of the Shrek saga was still being made. When I saw the trailer for ""Shrek Ever After"" I was less than impressed probably because I was still angry about the last film. Regardless of how I felt as well as many over movie lovers, ""Shrek Ever After"" was released into theaters just three weeks ago and received average reviews. This past weekend, I decided to go see the film with my girlfriend just to see how the final chapter ends...""Shrek Ever After"" picks up right where ""Shrek the Third"" left off. Shrek and Fiona are now married with kids. They are the most respected and sought after family of Far Far Away and everyone in town loves them. One day after going through what seems to be a midlife crisis, Shrek becomes flustered and flips out at his kids birthday party. He makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to give him one day of his life in order for him to feel what it is like to be free again without having kids, a wife, and of course being respected instead of feared. This is where the plot thickens as Rumpelstiltskin tricks Shrek into signing the contract that states he has never been born. The only way to break this contract is to make Fiona, who has no clue who Shrek is, fall in love with him all over again.As soon as the credits began to roll, my first response was that wasn't too bad. Given the fact that ""Shrek the Third"" was a slap in the face to the Shrek franchise, I was somewhat impressed with the final entry. I wouldn't say I was blown away with it but it was like a masterpiece compared to the third film. The character Rumpelstiltskin was actually a fun character and I liked his personality. That was one of the main things that really made the film work especially since Prince Charming in the last film was such a boring and uninteresting character. I also thought the whole reliving the earlier chapters of Shrek's life worked well and I liked what they did with Fiona in this film. They made her a much tougher character. Then of course last but not least Puss in Boots, who is the best character in all the films.Even though I enjoyed this film, I have to admit I am glad this was the final chapter because I can't see this franchise surviving another film. While the storyline about the midlife crisis and appreciating what you have was good especially for this type of film, it just seemed like the writers were pushing it a bit. I don't know exactly why it seemed that way but I guess its just that most of it seemed like more of the same. The charm was there unlike in the third but it wasn't as potent as it was in the original two films. That's probably my main complaint about the film, this felt like a movie that was just made as a good bye to the franchise. It wasn't truly necessary but almost served as an apology for the 3rd film. I loved how they never even addressed the main character from the 3rd film. It was like he never existed, which I have to admit was pretty funny.In the end, I can't really say anything too harsh about the film. I think kids will like it although it is a bit more dark and depressing than the other chapters. I would say out of all of the films, this one is geared more towards adults than anyone else. The movie was also deeper than all the other entries. It was a decent final film and I applaud the writers and director for trying to redeem the franchise. I wouldn't say its a must own but for those who enjoy these characters and enjoy Shrek as a whole, I recommend seeing the final chapter at least once. Sure its no where near as unique or fun as the original two but if you want to pretend the third film never happened this one would be a good filler for that. It's not on a Pixar level as far as quality goes but in terms of a decent animated flick at the box office, ""Shrek Ever After"" is a good choice.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Shrek Ever After"" is a 7 out of 10. Take the kids, the family or who ever else likes the franchise and just enjoy the simple yet fun final chapter."
9,Shrek Forever After,10,13 July 2010,Entertaining and a great closure to the series,"That is me hoping there won'r be more Shreks. Because this part's story and morals truly made a perfect closure from where and how it all begun in the original ""Shrek"". Also, I think this part gave a whole new depth and meaning for the theme song ""It Is You I Have Loved All Along"".I don't think a 3D version has anything to offer, you might as well watch this in 2D. (But I think the whole 3D thing is pointless anyway. Movies ARE meant to be watched and not ""lived"". That's why they are movies and not real life experiences. That's why we don't NEED them at our face.) Anyway... This is totally worth the price of the movie theater ticket, if you can look at the film from a little bit new perspective.I understand why some might think this not as good and magical as some of the earlier parts as this does lack action and fairytale feel, relatively seeing to them, but I don't think this needed any of it, to be as great as they. Because I see this as a closure, which needed to focus on the morals rather than magic and fairytale elements. And the moral of this part, in my opinion, is the deepest and most important of them all. Count your blessings before they're all gone and don't throw them away for something you already chose to give up, because what past choices seem insignificant for the moment, may have make all the difference in the world. This is combined to the lesson of how you should always read any contract before signing it. ""You took the day I was born!"" ""Correction: You GAVE it to me. Since you were never born, you have no wife and no kids. And when this day ends, your life will end."" No Shrek movie has ever taken its morals to this utter level and meaning. I find it completely fascinating and extremely well portrayed in the story.I didn't find the humor remarkably childish or in any way changed seeing to the earlier parts. At least, not during most of the movie.Also, I don't care if the entertainment relied much on the beloved characters, because the characters were put in completely different situations than they had ever been in, which caused them to have developed some new feelings and characteristics. Especially Fiona, and Puss.And one of the new characters I find relatively outstanding. Rumplestiltskin. All the other versions I have known, portray him as a rather helpless dwarf, who only pops up here and there and demand a mother to give him her baby, while he perhaps cracks some supposed-to-be-good jokes. But here, they portrayed him as a clever, cunning, bitter, angry fellow with a new obsession and turned him into downright a little sh*t. And the way they had drawn/animated him reflected every bit of that. I think he's a wonderful character in this film.Perhaps there is less for kids to enjoy than in the earlier parts, but can you even say that any of the Shrek movies have been targeted essentially to kids anyway? I never thought they were.This fourth Shrek is officially one of the most inspiring movies I've seen for quite a while and does stand strong ground next to earlier parts of the series. Warmly recommendable to a Shrek fan, and to anyone who's out for good entertainment."
10,Shrek Forever After,9,21 May 2010,A return to form to end the franchise,"Shrek Forever After (and yes, that's the official title as seen in the first real shot of the film) is a welcome return to form after the disappointment of Shrek The Third, which LOOKED beautiful but hit all the wrong notes. This one has recaptured the fun of the franchise while potentially being the darkest one in terms of plot. Alternate universe stories have been done to death, but the appealing nature of so many of the characters makes this one work, as well as the fact that the filmmakers are clearly trying to wrap up the story (which includes a small bit of retconning at the beginning, but it pays off toward the end). The 3D occasionally falls into the trap of throwing things towards the audience, but the characters and sets are so beautifully animated in all dimensions (the textures of Shrek and Donkey, particularly, have improved even on the wonder that was Kung Fu Panda) that the 3D actually adds to the enjoyment. The first two remain the crown jewels of the franchise, but this is a worthy addition and a suitable end to the... well, saga is too strong a word, so storyline will have to do. And the bonus? Eddie Murphy gets to sing SEVERAL songs WITHIN the movie!"
11,Shrek Forever After,7,27 May 2010,Not bad but is not as good as the first two predecessors,"It's not really cool to like Dreamworks Animation anymore. Sure, they're not Pixar. Sure, they're too hung up on star power and pop culture references. But I've still enjoyed the majority their films more than I have a lot of what's out there. And I love the first two ""Shrek"" movies. Their funny, entertaining, terrifically animated, and, too me, some of the best animated love stories that have been made. Most fairy tale romances perpetuate the idea that love is for beautiful people (even the masterpiece ""Beauty and the Beast"" has it's cake and eats it too on this point), and Princes and Princesses are better than common people. ""Shrek""'s idea of finding happiness in who you are was much more palatable to me. i found the first film a delight, and the second even better.But the third was only okay. The humor wasn't nearly as clever or funny, and the heart just wasn't there like it used to be. ""Shrek Forever After"" isn't as good as those first two. But it's a big step back in the right direction.The story begins with Shrek getting used to being a father. He loves Fiona and the kids, but he misses his old life as a menacing ogre. He's seen more as a lovable tourist attraction now, and he doesn't like it. So, he makes a deal with the mysterious Rumpletiltskin (surprisingly NOT voiced by a name actor) to get one day back in his old life. In exchange, he gives up one day from his past. A day from his childhood that he doesn't even remember.Unfortuntaely, that day turns out to be the day he was born, and this leads to an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario where Shrek doesn't know Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, or any of his friends, and Rumplestiltskin rules the Kingdom with a tiny iron fist. The resulting story is a great deal of fun, with Fiona now a warrior leading an ogre rebellion, the Gingerbread Man fighting as a gladiator against Animal Crackers, and so forth. The humor isn't back to it's highest heights, but there are a good number of genuine laughs. And the heart is back bigtime. I found ""Shrek Forever After"" surprisingly touching..Okay, it's not as good as ""Toy Story 3"" is likely to be, nor is it as good as ""How to train your Dragon"". but I had a blast with ""Shrek Forver After"" Evren Buyruk"
12,Shrek Forever After,9,2 July 2010,"Shrek Manages to Delight Four Times in a Row,","Shrek Forever After is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding voice cast and characters.The Shrek film series have been emotional and funny movies from the very beginning and they have always had humour for kids and adults,Shrek Forever After was for the fourth time in a row a lovely Shrek movie.This movie is also filled with some lovely new characters,I particularly liked Butter Pants,a child who is a huge fan of Shrek and constantly asks him at the start of the movie to do his signature roar.Its definitely not as good as the first or second Shrek but it's a big improvement from the third.Shrek Forever After is a pleasing finale to a great film series and fans of the previous Shrek's will definitely be impressed. When Shrek starts missing his days as a real ogre he comes across Rumpelstiltskin,who offers him an ogre for a day deal,but it turns out to be a terrible mistake and Shrek has never saved Fiona ,hes never met Donkey,Puss In Boots or the rest of his friends and Rumpelstiltskin is king of Far Far Away.Its now all up to Shrek to get things back to normal and kiss his true love before midnight or he will cease to exist."

14,Shrek Forever After,4,22 May 2010,Time to say Shrek Good-Bye...,"Shrek has gone down a cult film character... so has Donkey, Fiona and Puss in Boots, thanks to the film that these characters became such a craze. Shrek was awesome, Sherk 2 was legendary, but the last one before this one 'Shrek The Third' was a yawn. Now comes 'Shrek Forever After', which ends the Shrek series... well if there is one more left, then I guess I won't be looking forward to it! The problem with 'Shrek The Third' and 'Shrek Forever After' are it's script. The writing is bland, you except a lot from Shrek, due to the wholesome entertainment we've witnessed before. The Final Chapter has it's share of funny and light moments, but they are far and between! What saves this disappointment is it's characters. Myers as Shrek is as good as ever! Diaz gives Fiona the voice she needs. Donkey and Puss-In Boots voiced by Icons like Murphy and Banderas are the life of the show. They are funny and spot-on. Walt Dohrn as the evil-head Rumplestilskin is just about okay.All n all, It's truly time to say Shrek and his friends Good-Bye. Thanks for the entertainment you gave us in the first 2 flicks, now you guys are getting wasted in poor scripts. So, Have a nice time at Far Far Away!"
15,Shrek Forever After,4,23 May 2010,Shrek goes out on a low note:(,"It's sad to watch a fall from greatness and that's what can best be described for the 'Shrek' films. The series started out strong with the first two movies and began to stumble into routine with the third. Now all the novelty and energy is gone and with 'Shrek Ever After' the audience gets a predictable, by-the-numbers, formula movie.I think the main problem has to do with the fact that Shrek, Donkey, Fiona and Puss have lost all of the chemistry that made the earlier movies fun. The comfort in their interactions drains all of the opening scenes of life. The main crisis in this film is also a little weak: Shrek has grown tired of his life as a celebrity ogre (this plot point is handled awkwardly in the opening scenes) and makes a deal with Rumplestilskin to go back to when he was feared by others. You know the movie's in trouble when this ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario is inserted to try to breathe some novelty into Shrek's story.This wouldn't be a problem if the movie had fun with this situation. Sadly, it focuses more on action scenes to show off the 3-D effects rather than focusing on the alternate realities of the characters. There is an extended scene of Shrek flying a witches broom to escape from Rumplestilskin's castle, which is cool, but really exist for no other purpose than to give the audience a roller-coaster simulation. The same can be said for a drawn out flying dragon scene in the beginning of the film as well.This movie also has less of the pop culture references that made the other films in the series enjoyable for adults as well as kids. The first film, in particular, seemed to be taking a lot of jabs at Disney, now it seems like Dreamworks is less hostile towards their competitors. Ultimately, The film wastes opportunities to have fun not just with the series regulars but also with the new characters: the Pied Piper, Rumplestilskin, the witches and all the other ogres. This was disappointing way to say goodbye to Shrek:("
16,Shrek Forever After,5,26 May 2010,Finally it ends.,"Shrek Forever After is a great movie to take your kids to go see. It has the dry humor, the silly moments, and of course every fairytale melted into one. It is not as entertaining for the adults as it was during the first two Shrek movies. There was nothing original about the humor as if we had already heard all the jokes before, and the repetitive themes were a little too much.The effects were spectacular though, and would be even better to see in 3-D, as I did not. I recommend this to families-- and families only. If you are a teenager going with a bunch of friends, you probably won't like it as much, same to young adults. I give it a 5/10 due to lacking a passionate script."
17,Shrek Forever After,9,1 September 2010,Do the roar!,"After the dismal effort that was Shrek the Third, I had no real expectations from this fourth outing for Dreamwork's lucrative green ogre and his fairytale pals; all I was looking for was an hour-and-a-half's mindless distraction from a very boring cross-channel ferry journey.What a pleasant surprise it was, then, to discover that this latest Shrek adventure is not only much, much better than the previous chapter, but is actually as enjoyable as the first two, with a cool 'alternate reality' storyline, a memorable villain in the form of the marvellously malevolent Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn), some terrific new characters and plenty of familiar ones, loads of genuinely laugh-out-loud moments (Donkey's party trick with a pair of eyeballs still has me chuckling a week later), and a well-worn but still heart-warming message: that we should spend more time appreciating the good things we have in life, rather than yearning for the things we don't have.On the more technical side, the CGI is excellent and really makes me wish that I had seen the film in glorious 3D to fully appreciate the impressive visuals; furthermore, the voice-work is perfect as one would expect from the talented cast, and the choice of music is inspired (check out the witches busting some moves to The Beastie Boys).With Shrek the Third, it had looked as though the fairy-tale was finally over, but if Dreamworks can guarantee to keep the quality this high, I have no problems with them spinning out the franchise for a few more adventures."
18,Shrek Forever After,8,22 July 2010,"An improvement over ""Shrek the Third"".","Shrek (Voiced by Mike Myers) is suffering an mid-life crisis. He hasn't happy with his life, especially having his soul-mate Princess Fiona (Voiced by Cameron Diaz) and his three children. Shrek misses the old days, when everyone was afraid of him. Rumpelstiltskin (Voiced by Walt Hohrn) gives him an chance to re-live his old life for an day by singing an contract. At first, Shrek is happy until he discovers that his best friend Donkey (Voiced by Eddie Murphy) doesn't remember him and Shrek isn't married. He finds himself in an alternative universe. Now Shrek has to find Princess Fiona to convinced her, they had an life together once. But Rumpelstiltskin has other plans for Shrek.Directed by Mike Mitchell (Deuce Bigelow:Male Gigolo, Sky High, Surviving Christmas) made an enjoy fourth ""Shrek"" film in the series. It is certainly better than ""Shrek the Third"" and probably even better than ""Shrek 2"" as well. Voice talents in the movie are terrific, especially new comer Hohrn as Rumpelstiltskin but it is Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss in Boots steals the show. It is nice to see the new ""Shrek"" movie in Widescreen format as well. This is also an darker movie than the previous ""Shrek"" films. Since this is the final chapter, the series certainly ends well. Don't miss it. Digital Widescreen. (****/*****)."
19,Shrek Forever After,8,5 July 2010,Happily Ever After,"I'm a big fan of the first two Shrek movies. The first Shrek, in particular, was a hilarious, heartfelt and original delight. Whilst Shrek 2 couldn't match the first film's originality, it was still a hugely enjoyable piece of entertainment. With Shrek The Third, the franchise ground to a halt. I don't hate Shrek The Third; I just find it sluggish, stuffed with too many characters and lacking ideas. So, it was with some trepidation that I approached Shrek Forever After.Thankfully, Shrek Forever After is a fitting finale for the franchise; it is very funny, sweet and, through a nice Wonderful Life-like twist, it shows us the characters we all know and love in a different light.Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is having a midnight crisis. Despite living happily with his wife Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) and their three children, Shrek longs for the days when he was feared by the townspeople, instead of the tourist attraction that he has now become. After Shrek's pent-up anger is unleashed during his daughter's first birthday, he is tricked by the devious Rumpelstiltskin into signing a deal which will allow him to live as a real ogre for one day at the expense of one day from his life. In his ""ogre"" day, Shrek realised that Rumpelstiltskin has stolen the day he was born; this means that Shrek never met Donkey, Puss in Boots or any of his other friends, and he didn't save Fiona from the tower. Shrek soon finds his friends, but they're not how he remembers them. Together, they must battle against Ruimpelstiltskin, who has taken over Far Far Away, and Shrek must find a way to reverse Rumpelstiltskin's magic before his day is over, or he will disappear from existence.Shrek Forever After succeeds where Shrek the Third failed because it returns to the charm of its characters and its story. Shrek the Third relied more on its (admittedly eye-popping) visuals, hit-and-miss pop-culture jokes and stunt casting (hello, Mr. Timberlake) than on creating a strong story or in taking its characters on an entertaining, interesting journey. Shrek Forever After rectifies all of these mistakes; the pop-culture gags are few and far in-between, with most of the film's humour coming from characters and their situations. There is no obvious stunt casting here, but that works to the film's advantage. Ever heard of Walt Dohrn? No, me neither. But he damn near steals the film as the tricky Rumpelstiltskin, his vocal performance a blast of snivelling razzmatazz. Plus, new director Mike Mitchell and screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke do funny, new things with familiar characters. For example, whereas Puss in Boots was a swarthy swashbuckler, in the alternate universe he resembles a balloon covered in fur, who can't move without it being an Olympian task (one moment where he's struggling to, um, lick himself leads to the funniest use of his famous ""ahhhh"" eyes in the series). Whereas Fiona is a tired housewife in Shrek's real universe, in the alternate universe she is the tough, sexy (hey, I'm a hot-blooded male) rebel leader of the Ogre resistance against Rumpelstiltskin. Mitchell, Klausner and Lemke clearly have a lot of fun twisting our expectations of what the characters will do or what will happen to them, and I had a lot of fun with them. There is one death scene (shock!) which comes out of mid-field, and is even more hilarious as a result.The vocal work is strong. Mike Myers excels here as Shrek; he brings a real sense of human weariness and sarcastic wit to a fairytale character, which grounds him in reality. Shrek's midlife struggle with the loss of the spark in his life before he met Fiona will ring true with many viewers; many people, in the middle of a marriage, will look back on their freer days with a sense of nostalgia and wish they could re-live them again. Shrek's fault is that he doesn't realise what he has until he loses it. Cameron Diaz excels in both personalities; the tired but loving wife and the Xena-like warrior, the latter in which she particularly seems to be letting loose and having a lot of fun. Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas are their usual hilarious selves, both of them taking advantage of their characters and their new situations, with Banderas relishing his character's pampered lifestyle as Fiona's pet and Murphy still getting big laughs out of his chatterbox sidekick. The supporting cast is filled with talented actors, most notably Craig Robinson, Glee's Jane Lynch and Mad Men's Jon Hamm as members of the Ogre resistance.The animation here is beautifully done and highly detailed. One caveat; as anyone who has seen the advertising knows, this film is being shown in 3D. The 3D isn't a distraction, as in Alice in Wonderland and (from what I've heard) Clash of the Titans; it's just doesn't necessarily add anything either. It's just there. In Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon, the 3D deepened the sense of immersion into an imaginary world. Here, it seems more perfunctory than anything else. So my advice is to see this in 2D and save your money.Shrek Forever After erases the disappointment of Shrek the Third. There is a familiarity to the story which stops it from reaching the heights of the first film, but it is enjoyable enough to be on the same level as Shrek 2. This is a thoroughly entertaining conclusion to the Shrek legacy, and I'm going to miss the big guy."
20,Shrek Forever After,5,15 May 2010,Shrek has lost a step,"Another summer, another ""Shrek."" This time Shrek (Mike Myers) is unhappy with the monotony of marriage and fatherhood and goes to Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who promises to magically give Shrek a day in his old ogre lifestyle if Shrek willingly gives up a day in his childhood. What Shrek doesn't know is that Rumpel has been after the throne to Far Far Away ever since Fiona (Cameron Diaz) was locked in the tower and Shrek signing his life away is the perfect opportunity for the crazy little dwarf to take power. Not only that but since Shrek technically never existed, nobody remembers him, not even Donkey (Eddie Murphy) or Puss (Antonio Banderas), the kingdom has been ravaged by Rumpel, and Fiona has given up on finding a knight in shining armor and become one herself. This all amounts to some harmless stuff for the kids basically, which is kind of sad since the first two were such clever fairy-tale satires. This fourth and last installment in the series plays out predictably, relies on the same stale themes (love conquers all, life was never meant to be a fairy-tale), goes for the easy jokes (poop, pee, belch, and Puss has let himself go for the fat gags), and also relies way too much on characters with funny voices or who sing and dance to pop culture songs. This is also the first in the series to be presented in 3-D but the unremarkable action doesn't even come close to warranting a 3-D viewing. While not as bad as ""Shrek the Third"", ""Shrek Forever After"" nevertheless feels something like a direct-to-DVD knock-off that might excite kids looking for some mild entertainment, but I think even they'll notice that Shrek has lost a step."
21,Shrek Forever After,10,22 July 2010,A Fantastic Ending,"Simply a perfect film. I enjoyed every minute, and found the animation be superior to many other films of its genre. The writing is hilarious, with some very risky jokes tossed in, but should still be suitable for everyone. Many people say that it just shows off the 3D effects, but I am completely against this point of view, as I saw the 2D version and fell in love with the film.Some say that it follows the old plot line, but personally, I think this is a completely different plot line. Its hard to explain without giving out spoilers. Suffice it to say that you wont be disappointed.If you haven't seen this yet, go see it. If you have seen it, go see it again. If you've seen it twice, go buy the DVD, god damn it. Superb film, I can't see a flaw in this."
22,Shrek Forever After,,22 May 2010,jumped the Shrek and the Shark ... terrible,"Shrek is back for his fourth and hopefully last run and there's no plot, no story and none of the great little one liners or wink to the older crowd jokes we have enjoyed with the previous Shrek films. With everything Pixar can deliver nowadays, do we really need to try and squeeze blood from a franchise like this one? If Shrek 3 didn't pull it off than this one certainly has... This movie has jumped the Shrek and the Shark. Want a movie that is chalked filled with jokes that fall flat? Go see Shrek 4never.Ever wonder why Hollywood is rebooting everything and spinning off bad TV shows? Well, they're clearly out of good ideas. More proof is green-lighting a fourth Shrek movie that's this bad. There's no way you can tell me that any studio exec read the treatment for this animated turd and thought it was a good idea for an entertaining film. They simply crunched the money numbers and ordered the standard grab for the wallet. Too bad I fell for it like a lot of people probably will. When will I learn my lesson?"
23,Shrek Forever After,5,28 March 2011,"Pointless addition, but is better than third.","My biggest problem with this so called final installment is the fact that the entire movie does not need to exist. The plot itself is something that screams 'no more creativity'. Let's take a look shall we? Shrek feels empty inside as he has to do the same old chores over and over again, his life has become so redundant he ends up hating it. He wants things to go back to the way they were before he became and father, met Fiona and knew any of his friends. He wants to be a lonely Ogre again. So he makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin and he gets his wish. Now we are thrust into an alternate reality where he never met Fiona, Donkey, or his friends. There is a catch though, if he doesn't kiss Fiona before a certain time, he is stuck in this alternate reality. He now must get Fiona to fall in love with him again in order to put things back to the way they were before he was tricked. To me, once you are telling stories about alternate realities and what ifs...you know the series is done for. For some strange reason they all thought there was one more left in them, sadly the answer is no. I will say this though, the 4th one is indeed better than the garbage known as Shrek the Third, but that isn't saying much. It fails to capture the magic that the first one had, or even the second, which I am also not a big fan of. To me, Shrek was always a one film story. Three sequels later, we are treated to a slowly dying franchise. The animation is great, as always, if still a bit behind Pixar outings. The kids will no doubt be entertained by it, it's colourful enough to keep their attention, which seems to be the case with every kids movie. It's the adults that have to see it with them (or on their own) who will be the disappointed ones."
24,Shrek Forever After,2,25 September 2010,A money making exercise,"The first Shrek movies were full of fun and adventure. The third film was disappointing and it seemed it was time to put the franchise to bed. The recent explosion in 3d movies obviously made the production company see an opportunity to make some money from a 3d Shrek instalment.The biggest problem with Shrek forever after is where to go with the franchise. The opening sequence of the movie see's shrek in domestic bliss but longing for his former life. The stupor is a fairly good analogy for the film itself. Shrek is taken to an alternative world where he hasn't met any of his friends, but although there are some good moments you long for the adventure of the first 2 Shrek films."
25,Shrek Forever After,8,29 June 2010,"Much better than ""Shrek the Third"" and is a surprisingly good film","""Shrek Forever After"" is a surprisingly good film. Though it is not as great as ""Shrek"" or ""Shrek 2"" it is a HUGE improvement over ""Shrek the Third."" The movie helped the franchise gain some of its heart back that was lacking in the third film and had some terrific action scenes. The first time I saw it I didn't think it was very funny, but when I went back to see it a second time I was laughing plenty of times. The film also teaches an important lesson that if you have a good life you should not give it up for anything. If Shrek had never met Fiona or any of his friends they all would have had rough lives. Overall, the movie is a great conclusion to the film series."
26,Shrek Forever After,8,17 June 2010,"Returning to what made Shrek fun, but did it work?","What was so great about the first Shrek film was the relationship between the characters and the world that was created for this film. The relationship between Shrek, Donkey, Fiona and all the other characters was ironclad in its design. The world created for Shrek  the fact that he is an Ogre, lives in the woods and is feared by most, but not by his friends, was just wonderful fun. I feel the Shrek Franchise made a mistake, when they went away from what they established in the first film, by moving the Shrek ""family of characters"" into a new setting, which is being King and Queen of the Kingdom of Far Far Away, with the supporting cast falling in line behind them and changing the setting from the woods to the Kingdom. In the second and third films I felt we lost some of what Shrek was all about. It seemed to take on a form that had been seen time and time again in other films. It lost its luster and became boring. So, it was nice to see this film (#4), try to recapture that magic by channeling elements found in the first film, by using a unique-device (I have been calling it the J.J. Abrams approach), by having Shrek's past changed by a devious ""bad guy"", thus removing the King and Queen scenario and creating a situation much like the first film. How would it do? Even though the second and third films had problems maintaining my interest, what they did have was laughs and great animation. Well the laughs have been all used up by the time we get to this film. Donkey's character almost was invisible. The bad guy, in this case was Rumpelstiltskin, seemed to be a carbon-copy of all the other antagonists from the previous films and the supporting characters, including the ridiculous Dragon, have run out of gas. We have an idea that starts out great, but is mired down by a tired formula, with not many laughs. I did enjoy the army of witches that Rumpelstiltskin had at his command. The animation does look fantastic and that is boosted by the witches appearances. They actually were scary. I was disappointed with this film because of it not being funny, but the great animation, the witches and rehashing what made Shrek great makes it the second best film of the series."
27,Shrek Forever After,1,6 June 2010,Indescribable,"Over the years, the megalomaniacal geniuses of the Dreamworks animated movies are getting unfunnier and unfunnier with star power and pop culture references; they think they are smart to lure unsuspecting moviegoers and families into thinking their movies will sell to the world and will be just as good as the first ""Shrek"" or even ""Shrek 2,"" which is sad to say, the only two good Dreamworks movies there ever was. Everything else is all the same. Get a roundup of actors. Draw them to how they look like in their human forms. Give personalities to the characters that match their acting styles, only to exploit those actors. Add some stupid pop culture references out of nowhere to make the adults laugh, and they never do. And then the movie rakes in the money, but adults get bored and think it's just another ego vehicle, and small children are too young to notice a thing.So is to speak of ""Shrek Forever After,"" which they say will be last ""Shrek"" movie, and hopefully so because it is simply the worst and worse than ""Shrek the Third,"" where the series was starting to outwear its welcome. So has the dumb Dreamworks animation studios, and I hope I'll never see another one of their animated movies, just sticking with Pixar, like all other smart moviegoers. Adults and children all love Pixar, and it has never failed on gone on an ego trip even once.In my best overview, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese (who died as the frog in ""Shrek the Third, and appears in a flashback in the first scene), and Julie Andrews return, getting their paychecks, but little payoff. Walt Dohrn is the new villain, a creepy character named Rumplestiltskin, and he isn't convincing, just dark and creepy. This is without a doubt the darkest of all the Shrek Movies, with the darkest settings and elements. Bored with his life as a family man, Myers as Shrek wants to go back to the glory days as an ogre, so he makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin, foolishly signs the contract, and gets into so much trouble in his alternate reality world. He is not born, and Rumplestiltskin is the head of Far Far Away. The gnome has captured all ogres but Shrek. Diaz as Fiona, who looks like a warrior, is captured, and in this reality, she doesn't know who Shrek is. Murphy as Donkey tags along and jabbers as always. Banderas as Puss in Boots does nothing but look fat. The witches are Rumplestiltskin's henchwomen who try to capture Shrek and don't let him go, and like all the other characters, they are creepy.If you think that's enough, rats (not the cute kind rom ""Ratatouille""),slugs, and eyeballs serve as sight gags. A bratty young boy chants in a gurgly voice, ""Do the roar"" to Shrek, in a cheap attempt to get laughs at the opening scene of the birthday party. Cakes are smashed.This movie was made in 3D, and this is the biggest ripoff of the year. I'm lucky I got in with discount tickets. Save your money everyone. And this has been the highest grossing movie for four weekends, but has the lowest and weakest box office record of all the ""Shrek"" movies. Hey, I'm a fan of Ralph Bakshi's ""Wizards,"" and this is no small comparison, but where one would think ""Wizards,"" or more appropriately, his ""Lord of the Rings"" the next year, was dark and murky, I thought ""Wizards"" was hilarious in a Mel Brooks mode. ""Shrek Forever After"" holds the record for the least cute, dreariest, and murkiest animated movie I've ever witnessed, and more so than Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" and Disney's only PG-rated ""The Black Cauldron."" Some things have to move on, and ""Shrek"" is one of them after a delightful start."
28,Shrek Forever After,4,23 May 2010,"Loved the first two, didn't like the third one and didn't like this one.","I loved the first Shrek. It was part of my childhood growing up. The second was when I was a teenager. The second one was just as good as the first one. Third one was a huge let down for me. As was this one.Part of the reason why I liked this was because the whole cast return to do their character voices. So it's great that no one pulled out, fantastic! The problem with this movie is the humor falls flat as does the plot and characters. The first two we would understand and feel something for the characters. in this one you just don't care not one little bit. I wont explain the plot, but you will see what I mean. The whole plo9t just seemed pointless. It all ended up being predictable and you knew exactly what was going to happen. SOMETIMES things can be predictable and fun, in this one it's just predictable and stupid.I really don't know what else to say. The script was badly written. Only thing I can recommend this for is if you are Shrek Die hard Fans who will love the characters no matter what! 4/10"
29,Shrek Forever After,1,10 January 2012,Desperately short of gags,"I simply don't understand where they were trying to go with this. Since they were cashing in for a third and final time, it would make good financial sense to spend money on the script and up the jokes-per-minute to something that rivals the first movie. But fresh in my memory though this still is, I can't remember a single gag.I saw a lot of emotional conflict and a rather severe life lesson for a character that was under a lot of (totally understandable) emotional stress - was that really the point? This is a children's movie from a franchise that initially promised to entertain kids and adults alike. Why should kids care about Shrek's marriage problems unless it's somehow funny?Really quite a bizarre experience. The franchise went from original and fast-paced, belly-laugh funny family movie to tiresome soap opera in 4 hops. The sheer greedy ineptitude of those that allowed it to get from paper to screen in this form is just mind boggling.Funny movie with no jokes, so no points."
30,Shrek Forever After,8,6 October 2010,A very decent ending for Shrek,"Shrek 4 or Shrek Forever After is the latest and final chapter of this Shrek's series. In this one, we found a Shrek bored with his present life, no one fears him anymore, that's why he makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to have at least one day of the life he had but with catastrophic consequences and realizing that he already had all he wants in life. In my opinion this 4th movie is way better than the third one but not as good as the first two. It is better developed, has more adventure and it is funnier. The story is more interesting and original and it doesn't have unnecessary characters. It has a good rhythm that will keep you entertain for the entire movie. As usual the animation is perfect and with the plus of 3-D even better. The cast of voices is great. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas return as Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and Puss in boots, everyone with excellent performances and as the villain Rumpelstiltskin we have Walt Dohrn with a convincing job. In conclusion, Shrek Forever After is a enjoyable and entertaining movie for all the family and a very good ending for the series."
31,Shrek Forever After,9,1 September 2010,it's really funny and amazing movie series,"I love Shrek the series always, it's make me laugh and feel good all the time, this time too I would have to say the 3D effect is the best I've ever seen till now, it's truly IN3D, I would you suggest to experience it in theater, I'm quite sure you'll enjoy the fun and amazing 2 hours there I would give 10 score if I can, but everything can't be perfect, so I choose give it 9 instead, it's to say, 9 is full mark in my mind the graphic is flawless and beautiful as last 3 ones, music is also have some old songs you may heard of and classic ones, like Carpenter's ""Top of the World"" I love this song always since I'm a child, you may like it too"
32,Shrek Forever After,9,8 August 2010,Very Entertaining,"On a flight back to the U.S. I had the opportunity to watch this movie.It could be that I hadn't seen an English speaking movie for weeks, it could be that I have a fat red tabby that relates to Puss, or it could be that I've survived the mid-life era of life and can relate to wanting to be someone else, but I laughed myself to shameless embarrassment while watching. Predictable, yes, but the laugh was worth my time.The characters are consistent, but there are a few additions still effective in pulling for the good guys. I plan to buy it to watch again with friends who can relate as well."
33,Shrek Forever After,9,21 July 2010,"Shrek forever after worth a watch, animation is good, 3D is better than Avatar, and script is somewhat unexpected and was good","I just came watching Shrek 4 in 3D and it felt good writing a review about this movie. It's definitely worth last 2 hours and the entertainment was really good. Seeing after Shrek 3, I didn't expected Shrek 4 to be that charming and good but introduction of new characters and a new storyline and a better 3D features has definitely add to its entertainment. Seeing a new Feona in this movie, the one that can fight, jump and lead was good and the nice scene when puss in boots made that look with his eyes towards donkey to lick his tail were good one to watch. The 3D features are really good and you will definitely enjoy watching it."
34,Shrek Forever After,8,8 June 2010,pleasantly surprised,"i begrudgingly saw this flik because i was i was on grand-dad duty. the reviews were horrible, but i found the movie fresh and entertaining. i laughed and chuckled more than the little girl did, though she did applaud at the end. i enjoyed the fact that they kept the same voices and kept the same characters intact, even though i thought it would be re-hash on re-hash. eddy murphy, as donkey was funny as ever. the assortment of witches and ogres i found artistic and creative. whoever the actor was that did Rumpelstiltskin was perfect, and i loved the portrayal of the pied piper and his hi-tech flute. i can heartily recommend seeing this movie (in 3-d) you won't regret it ."
35,Shrek Forever After,8,7 June 2010,Shrek Forever After should be a great way to end an iconic series,"I've now seen all four Shrek movies in first run in theatres. The first two were great and the last one wasn't so bad to me but this one, which should be the last one considering the way it ends, had a little more heart in characterization that got me quite touched which probably shouldn't surprise anyone who's read many of my comments under my username if they know that my favorite movie is It's a Wonderful Life since there are many elements here inspired from there. Kudos, as always, to the voices of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, and especially Mike Myers, for providing great pleasure these characters have provided me over the years. Seeing the character of Rumpelstiltskin as the villain was quite a good new twist here. And having the witches battle the ogres was also an exciting touch. And how about the way Puss in Boots lets himself go... Okay, I'll just say I highly recommend Shrek Forever After. And so long, Far Far Away...P.S. This was another animated movie I enjoyed watching in 3-D."
36,Shrek Forever After,10,4 June 2010,Better than expected,"Based off of what I heard about this film, I didn't go into it expecting too much. I'm glad I went into it with low expectations because this film certainly exceeded them. This installment of Shrek was extremely funny and enjoyable. I went with some friends and we laughed throughout the whole him. Yes, it may not be as good as Shrek and Shrek 2 but it's still funny. It was nice seeing some of our old favorite characters and some new ones. After watching the film I actually wished it wasn't the last. Taking a couple of years off in between films is a good thing for this franchise because you enjoy the characters more if you haven't seen them in a while. I would recommend this film to anyone looking to see something decent in the theater. I feel like this film is geared for more of a younger audience but an older audience would still appreciate this film."
37,Shrek Forever After,7,7 July 2010,"Not Exactly Magical, But A Good Finale","I've Recently watched Shrek 4 with my family over the weekend and I thought it was pretty entertaining. Sure the jokes were Clichéd and the plot was a bit unoriginal, sure its not better than the first two. Although its definitely better than the third. But I still had fun watching it and laughed out loud the whole way.The Last Scene was a bit disappointing, I thought we would see another Puss and Donkey Sequence just like Shrek 1,2,3 but I was disappointed by the lack of magic the final scene had, its supposed to be the final scene where you see Shrek and friends for the last time. Cmon they can do better than that.Overall I thought it was great fun, although not as good as the first two, It was still great fun, I laughed a lot, I had a great time. Thanks for the good times Shrek"
38,Shrek Forever After,8,7 June 2010,"If this is indeed the last, it does what all good finales do, leaves 'em begging for more!","Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wife-ogress, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) have settled into domestic bliss. They live in their wee cottage in the woods, with their darling, burping baby ogre triplets. Each day is pretty much the same as any other, as the happy couple feed their children, take out the soiled nappies, and deal with repairs. At supper, they break bread with their good friends, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). But, one day, at the triplets first birthday party, Shrek reaches a breaking point. Why he, Shrek, used to scare villagers with his roar and reek havoc and now he's changing diapers? So, he walks out and heads to the home of Rumplestiltskin. What the frustrated ogre wants is ONE day to be his old, fearsome self. Rumpy is happy to oblige, for he always has a contract with fine, fine print. Thus, when Shrek signs the agreement and happily goes off to scare a few towns, he doesn't realize that he has given Stilts the power to erase the day he, Shrek, was born and complete a long-ago contract he almost made with Fiona's parents to take their castle in exchange for finding their daughter a husband. Got that, everyone? So, in a very short period of time, Shrek is captured and held prisoner at the castle that is now Rumpy's, Donkey is a beast of burden for the dwarf's witchy companions and Fiona has become the fearsome leader of an underground liberation movement against the midget. Only another ""true love's kiss"" from Fiona will make things the way they were. Will it happen? This is a fun fourth sequel to the original and quite imaginative in animation and dialogue. The cast is wonderful, as always, with Myers, Diaz, Banderas, Julie Andrews and the rest doing fine work. Especially noteworthy is Murphy's turn, for he is just flat-out great as the fast-talking, excitable donkey. Then, too, the look of the film is gorgeous, with vibrant color and excellent animation, a true visual treat. As for the storyline, it has plenty of zest and originality and works characters from the fairy tale repertoire into its situations with ease. What child or adult, after seeing Rumplestiltskin, the Pied Piper, and Oz's witches, wouldn't clamor for the originals? That, of course, is the hidden treasure of the Shrek series, for the flicks invite viewers to get those volumes of folklore off the shelves of the library and into their hands and minds. Therefore, do make plans to see this new entry into the world of Shrek. If it is indeed the last hurrah, it does what good finales do, leaves 'em beggin for more."
39,Shrek Forever After,4,24 May 2010,Oscar? Most likely NOT!,"Firstly, let's get straight to the review. THE MOVIE was dull. What've they done. They ruined a great franchise. From the classic Shrek; to this little rubbish movie. The movie is just a joke, the animation is great but the story plot is wrong. It doesn't even follow the time line of the other Shrek. The voice of Ruplestukins was great, his voice screeched which made me WOW. The movie should thank the voice cover. Sorry i have no idea who. Shrek Shrek Shrek, its just a disgrace, the movie was so bad; i slept through the last part. Not trying to insult that much but. Shrek Forever delivers with the great animations and voice, But the bad story and dialogue. Will they make the Oscars. Probably Not. i would be surprised if they even got a animation3.6/10 Sorry shrek fans-. You won't like this one."
40,Shrek Forever After,10,3 June 2010,the third best Shrek,I am so happy that i finally got to see this shrek forever after... I loved all the shreks... The third one of shrek is a favorite and this one is my second favorite... I loved Shrek the most because he seems friendly and he also seems nice and he seems like a nice guy. I love the donkey also........ I think the Donkey is so funny... I love the Cat he is so funny.... I wish they would make another Shrek i wish this wasn't the last Shrek.. I hope to get this Shrek on DVD. I am interested in seeing the special effects on DVD of Shrek Forever after and to see the deleted scenes.. I love Eddie Murphy in this he is so funny as the Donkey. I think he was the best person to play the donkey. I think Mike Myers is so good as Shrek he deserves a round of applause.
41,Shrek Forever After,8,24 May 2010,Love It.,"Our family loved this Shrek. In fact, we liked it better than Shrek The Third. The kids enjoyed the new characters, and the fact that it was a little bit darker. We liked the way the story was constructed. Everyone in our movie Theatre applauded and said they enjoyed it. We have enjoyed all the Shrek movies, and think it ended the way it should of. I really don't have anything more to say, but for some reason I am not allowed to post anything unless it is a minium of 10 lines. I can't even imagine having ten lines worth of anything to say about a movie, I am not a critic, just a movie goer, and I definitely do not read the supposedly professional critics opinions. Their A's are usually my bombs."
42,Shrek Forever After,7,25 July 2010,Wolfie... do you have a wig that signifies that I'm pretty content?,"I should perhaps say right off the bat that I did not catch the third one(I love the original, and I like the second a lot). Everything I heard about it indicated that it was crap, so I skipped it. I'll be honest and say that this didn't grab my attention. At first, I wasn't going to go to the theater for it(I don't often go out of my way to watch anything animated, anyway). People told me it was worth it(if they weren't necessarily ecstatic about it), and the rating is decent on here. I'm glad I went. First off, the 3D is great, it doesn't get gimmicky so often that it's bothersome and it is an overall pleasant viewing experience. I would definitely say to go for that version. There is flight and similar things, as well as build-up of atmosphere, establishment of tone, etc. where it adds that extra layer, and these are quite effective. You feel like you're along for the ride, never overwhelmed and certainly not bored. The drama works throughout. When this goes for getting us emotionally involved, it nails it. It is exciting when it means to be. Sweet, not sappy, when that is appropriate. The relationship between Shrek and Fiona just works. You may already know the plot. It's your basic It's A Wonderful Life concept, one of the popular ideas(having appeared in a ton of shows with relatively little alteration to it), where our favorite ogre is suddenly in a world where he doesn't exist, and thus no one recognizes him. Overall, it's predictable, but there are surprises along the way, and it's not dull at any point. The comedy works two times out of three, and relatively seldom does anything fall embarrassingly flat on its face(there are some forced ones, mind you), if it isn't uproarious laughter that often. It's about as you'd expect, with cleverness and verbal material, plays on words, silliness, the occasional gross-out gag or anachronism joke, popular in many of these, I guess since Aladdin. The cast returns, and the new ones are good(first time I've found Robinson amusing, though it is also my first real exposure to him, other than trailers and interviews, where he leaves me cringing), if it is criminal to give Jane Lynch, and, to a lesser extent, Kathy Griffin, so few lines! We meet a handful of new characters(including one or two memorable ones) as familiar ones are pushed into the background. This is a nice way to end the series. I don't think there is anywhere interesting left to go(and if they write in more Faustian deals surrounding if Fiona is rescued from the keep or not, I demand that they file creative bankruptcy). To anyone else who may be cautious because this is done by the director of Deuce Bigalow and Surviving Christmas(which I hear is horrible; the novel's fine), don't worry. This is actually less dirty than the 2nd one. There is a bit of cartoon violence and a little mild language in this. I recommend this to fans of the first two who want a dependable closing chapter. 7/10"
43,Shrek Forever After,8,6 June 2010,Way better than I expected,"I really liked the first Shrek. I usually don't like crude humor, so the second and third weren't for me as it seemed crude humor was the goal.This fourth one was better is the second best in my opinion, after the first one.I feel like I can take anybody to it and recommend it to anybody without being embarrassed.The movie had a good theme, it was good fun, and I laughed plenty.Rumpelstiltskin was a rather comical bad guy and his witches made some nice pawns for the ogres to beat up on."
44,Shrek Forever After,8,4 June 2010,Shrek Gets It Right,"""Shrek Forever After"" is actually a return to the engaging storytelling of the first and second movies. Granted the story by Josh Kalusner and Darren Lemke is a take on ""It's a Wonderful Life""not entirely original. Shrek 4 is better than the last sequel and not a great as the first two movies. It is about falling in love all over again. So I was on board with that. Eddie Murphy is hysterical returning as Donkey. Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz also give their best in this clumsy sweet story. Director Mike Mitchell does a great job of capping the pop culture gagssome of the hip-hop Pied Piper jokes are inspired. Eddie Murphy is amazing with his renditions of retro classics.In ""Forever After"" Shrek (Myers) has become disenchanted with domestic life and the tedious routine. Life is goodhe has a loving wife and 3 beautiful ogre kids. However, Shrek flips out at the 1 year Birthday party for his kids. He misses the days when he was the feared ogre. Fiona (Diaz) tells Shrek, ""You have everything. You're the only one who doesn't see it."" Rashly Shrek signs a deal with Rumpelstiltskin (funny Walt Dohrn) where he trades a day in his life so that he can spend a day as the feared Ogre. However, the forfeit day is the day he was born.Shrek soon realizes what has happened. Fortunately, Donkey (Murphy), who doesn't know Shrek in this alternate universe, points out there is a loop hole. Shrek discovers that since he never rescued his beloved Fiona from the Dragon Castle, she rescued herself and has reinvented herself as the Valkyrie ogre leading the resistance against the tyranny of Rumpelstiltskin. Fiona has no idea who Shrek is. Can Shrek and Fiona fall in love all over again? There is a hysterical ""rock-um sock-um"" robots fight scene with both. At the story arc Shrek confesses to Fiona that ""The best part of the day was that I got to fall in love with you all over again."" ""Shrek Forever After"" gets it right in the end. And is really worth seeing."
45,Shrek Forever After,8,30 May 2010,A Welcome Surprise,"While ""Shrek Forever After"" may not recapture the biting wit and comedy of the original, it may just have the strongest story of the series.I think we can all agree that the third instalment of the Shrek series was mailed-in, and while there was a surprisingly good Christmas special last year, I wasn't holding out much hope for this film.As a mid-40s dad myself, I had no problem relating to the setup, that Shrek had become mired in the routine of family life and had started to question the choices he's made. After a birthday party outburst, he's offered a deal by Rumplestiltskin that give him a chance to be the feared, powerful ogre he was in younger days.Of course, there's a catch, and Shrek finds himself with the opportunity to see a world where he'd never been born a la Frank Capra. Sure, it's been done before, but the script uses the conceit well and the creative choices generally make sense.No, ""Shrek Forever After"" isn't as funny as the original ""Shrek"" (but what is?), but it's the story that's more important in this one anyway.Dreamworks has said this will be the last ""Shrek"", and it's a high note to end the series. Surely, we'll see more TV specials, and perhaps a spin off or two, but it's nice to see the writers do something worthwhile with these characters."
46,Shrek Forever After,1,21 September 2010,The worst film of 2010 so far,"As much as I loved the other 3 but this was like watching Cinderella III: A twist in time it was so bad. Shrek is now a family man but there is one thing that he misses the most,being a grumpy ogre again so what happens a ugly man named Raspunkin makes a deal with him and suddenly he ends up being in an alternative version of Far Far Away. Now Shrek must find Fiona and make her kiss him or else he will be gone forever. The charcthers were boring,Eddie Murphy wasn't interesting as Donkey anymore and it just wasn't good enough as I would have thought. Some things have being bugging me about this film like why isn't Fiona not a human and why is Puss in Boots a household cat. This and Spiderman 3 is crap. Not worth watching and avoid at all costs."
47,Shrek Forever After,7,26 July 2010,Be careful what you wish for,"Being the fourth part in the series the characters are well known by now: Shrek the Ogre is bored. He's not completely happy in his life, being locked between a loving wife and three kids, as well as friends with their families. Shrek wants to live again, wants to be a real ogre again. Lucky for him, there's someone that can help him with just that.Following up on three previous films - that have been gradually getting worse - this fourth film was expected to be the lowest point in the sequence. It fails to live up to that expectancy - IMO it's better than the 2nd and 3rd part added together (and only slightly worse than the 1st). The story plays out rather nicely, using (again) several fairy tale characters and their tricks and treats to set for a rolling story and a mission that needs solving before the world ends.The animation is great, I especially liked the ogre village. The 3D addition is pretty good as well - there are a few scenes that are clearly designed for 3D viewing and they work well. But it must be said that this really should be the last in the series - continuing on where this one stops really wouldn't make much sense.7 out of 10 ear shattering horns"
48,Shrek Forever After,8,24 July 2010,Splendid as usual,"This animation movie is not better nor worse than the best ones of its kind. But it's splendid indeed in its 3 D version. The images and visual effects are gorgeous, the puppet characters magnificent in their expressions almost human and Shrek himself maintains vivid the idea that unlike the clichés according to which only beautiful is good, ugly can also be good and even an ogre can be virtuous. The story is worth what it's worth being almost a mere pretext of the image show. In this movie the good Shreck becomes tired of domestic life and does the mistake of asking a mischievous sorcerer to put him back for one day in his past life of typical ogre. He pays a high price for this mistake and endangers his way of living which was happy after all, according to the principle that we only value what we have after losing it. We spend more two hours of very pleasant feelings and sensations watching this movie."
49,Shrek Forever After,7,23 July 2010,not as bad as u think,shriek forever after shriek the final chapter whatever the hell you want to call is out in cinemas and its time to review it right here right now .o and its in 3d .firstly the plot is about shriek who wants to feel like a real ogre when were scared of him and wanted him dead i know weird right.anyway shriek signs with Rumpelstiltskin i know try saying that with a straight face . he signs a deal with him and guess what it backfires on him so unpredictable right. OK the 3d was it good no way its horrible nothing pops out at you just pretty colors. seriously there's really trend of 3d movies coming out saw 7 jackass 3 step up 3 tron legacy seriously it needs to stop . sorry about wrong this website wont leave me say it right Jesus Christ i am angry
50,Shrek Forever After,6,15 July 2010,The second best one... so far.,"In a nutshell, better than the second and third movies, but not as good as the first.It wasn't nearly as funny as I expected. At first I figured this was due to a fairly empty auditorium (you know how infectious laughter can be). Then I began wondering if perhaps I was just becoming too old and long in the tooth for that particular brand of humour. Finally it dawned on me that much of my own amusement was diluted by the fact that I'd seen most of the funny bits already... on the movie trailers.Shrek 4 is yet another victim of the trailer curse, which definitely seems to ruin comedies more than any other movie type. As per usual, the two trailers I'd seen before finally catching the movie, seemed determined to show all of the laugh-out-loud moments.Have you ever noticed that comedies such as Knocked Up and The Hangover are so much more successful and talked about simply because the trailers show far less (in Knocked Up's case, they used just one scene).Anyway, Shrek 4 was entertaining enough despite the afore mentioned issue. I did laugh out loud a couple of times as did most others in the cinema. The story is fun and quite clever. The voice acting is top notch as always and the animation is as fantastic as you'd expect.So if by some miracle you can avoid the movie trailers then I expect you'll enjoy this movie more than I did. Otherwise, watching this fun bit of animation isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon :)"
51,Shrek Forever After,5,1 July 2010,"Oh Shrek, what happened","I loved the first Shrek. It was utter genius. And the second was an instant classic, too. After seeing commercials for the third, I knew it would suck, but it was a bit better than I thought it would be. And the same thing pretty much happened here.Many of the jokes fall flat, and the good ones are VERY over used. There are a few decent jokes sneaked in there, I may have chuckled once or twice, and it is undoubtedly better that the third, but unless your very bored, or really want to complete the series, you may want to skip this one.If it makes any difference to you, I had a very difficult time deciding between 4 and 5 stars, but decided to be nice."
52,Shrek Forever After,7,1 January 2014,"Far from being a failure, but Far, Far Away from being great","The Shrek series seemingly comes to its conclusion in this movie, and this is probably for the best; the series really lost its touch with the third movie, and sadly this movie, despite being okay, just can't recapture the magic and hilarity of the first two Shreks.The plot is simple: Shrek is fed up with fatherhood and his life as he is no longer taken seriously as an ogre, so he sells a day of his life to Rumpelstiltskin so he can live one day of being a feared ogre again. Unfortunately, Rumpelstiltskin took the day Shrek was born away, meaning Shrek never existed. He's in a race against time to find a way out of this mess or he'll disappear forever.The plot seemed to me to move by really fast, and I don't necessarily mean that as a positive; for instance, Shrek gets in with the ogre resistance rather quickly, giving no time for any of the other ogres to really be developed. This also doesn't leave much room for the alternate timeline Shrek is in to be explored; we see characters like Gingy and Pinocchio but they don't contribute much aside from a couple of joke scenes.The Pied Piper shows up at one point, but after his one scene he's never mentioned again. I was rather disappointed he wasn't used in the final battle.The biggest problem this movie has is the comedy: it's just not as funny as the first two. Yes, it's leagues better than the third, but that's not saying much. There are a few laughs to be had, but they aren't as consistent.Overall, this is a harmless and forgettable outing for the grumpy green giant. Though Shrek probably deserved a better sendoff than this, it's still okay for what it is. I'd say check it out if it's on TV, but otherwise you can just skip this and watch the first two and Puss in Boots instead."
53,Shrek Forever After,10,11 March 2013,Excellent!,Title Shrek forever after the final chapter. Setting In a little town. Plot Shrek and Fiona had a fight. But when went wrong Shrek did not know what to do. So Shrek tried to make things right again. Shrek found a way to get things right the massage was a true love kiss will break the spell. Shrek met a man called Rumpelstiltskin who offered him a deal for three days only. My favourite part My favourite part was when the pied piper made the ogres dance. Recommendation You should watch this movie because its funny. Because its funny when the ogres danced. I. Age 7 This movie review was submitted as part of a class project where we learnt about writing book reviews and movie reviews. We hope it is useful for you.
54,Shrek Forever After,10,15 January 2013,totally funny,"When you get to the fourth film in a franchise -- especially an animated franchise -- it's amazing enough that the series hasn't wound up in direct-to-DVD territory by now. But for such a film, like Shrek Forever After for example, to actually be sorta/kinda decent... well, what more can a parent who has to sit through the thing on a Saturday afternoon hope for? Make no mistake: That's what Shrek 4 is primarily designed to be, one last cash-in on the popular character by DreamWorks that is less art than it is commerce, a milking of a concept that serves as a cold reminder that the studio's critically praised How to Train Your Dragon is the exception, not the rule, for the house that Jeffrey Katzenberg built.This latest adventure is a spin on an age-old concept, one we've seen in everything from Star Trek to Buffy to It's a Wonderful Life. When the titular green ogre (voiced once again by Mike Myers, in what may be his last viable gig) becomes frustrated by his new domesticated life of changing diapers and being henpecked by his wife, he stumbles into a deal with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), the trickster of legend who, well, tricks Shrek into wishing himself into non-existence."
55,Shrek Forever After,5,20 December 2011,"Please, make this the last one","Considering the quick deterioration the Shrek franchise went through in it first three installments, the most incredible thing about Shrek Forever After is that it isn't any worse than Shrek the Third. In some aspects, actually, it's slightly better. That's not saying much though. Like the previous movie, Shrek Forever After is stale, repeats old jokes and basically, doesn't justify its own existence. Unlike the second and third movies, this one doesn't introduce any new characters that are in the least big interesting or funny. Rumpelstiltskin (they're really reaching for fairy-tale characters) is a dull and unimpressive lead villain, a disappointment in the series that produced excellent villains in Prince Charming and Lord Farquaad.Shrek Forever After is, in fact, the least funny of all four Shrek movies. The story is somewhat better than the previous entry, though, and the one thing that the movie does well is present a satisfying and conclusive ending to the series. As long as it's indeed the last one, it's as respectable a farewell as we could have expected from this rustic, once great franchise... oh, hold on, is the Donkey movie in production yet?"
56,Shrek Forever After,,7 August 2011,A Pitiful Finish to a Great Trilogy,"Rumpelstiltskin tricks a mid-life crisis burdened Shrek into allowing himself to be erased from existence and cast in a dark alternate timeline where Rumpel rules supreme.This is the film that killed the series, rather than having it end on a high note with part three. Shrek is now a bored, middle-aged father and husband... everyone loves him... it could end here, but instead they use a ""alternative reality"" story. Why? Just a bad idea.What is more bothersome is how this one seems to ignore the past films. Since Rumpelstiltskin and the Pied Piper both appeared in previous films, their characters should look the same, but they do not. At all. And Rumpel is voiced differently. When you lose continuity, you lose me as an audience member. (This is also the only one of the four without Prince Charming, but I think that is forgivable.) In short, not as funny, inventive, or sincere as the other three... and there is a gaping plot hole that I just feel they did nothing to rectify. (Namely, is a true love not a true love all the time?) Kids might not notice how poor this film is if they are so young they just like seeing ogres move around... but the film is so humorless that anyone over ten will be turned off by this one."
57,Shrek Forever After,5,6 June 2011,Falls flat and feels halfhearted,"The original Shrek animated film really seemed to offer a lot of promise for a potential franchise. It was a kids movie that was funny for both kids and adults, was way more clever than expected, and even had mild cursing that was both humorous and relevant. It was an animated film with a solid story that was entertaining for all ages and had that secret ingredient of heart to bring it all together. Unfortunately, the franchise seemed to slide further and further downhill from there. Shrek 2 was slightly amusing, but there weren't many laugh out loud moments. It was disappointing enough to make me skip Shrek the Third altogether. Which brings us to Shrek Forever After, the last Shrek film which serves more as a coup de grâce and that final nail in the coffin rather than a satisfying conclusion to what was once a promising franchise.The subtle humor used in the Shrek films has always been the high point for me, but the sequels seemed to use that humor less and less as the franchise went on. There are a few good uses of it in Shrek Forever After like Rumpelstiltskin's goose Fifi slowly ducking out of frame, the Queen locking the door to their carriage once they enter Rumpelstiltskin's sketchy neighborhood, and a fat Puss in Boots slowly sliding down his cat toy. But the sequels tend to be less about that kind of humor that reeled Shrek fans in to begin with and more about being cute or goofy while its execution feels underdeveloped or half-assed in the long run.Shrek Forever After begins shortly before the first film takes place right before Shrek rescues Princess Fiona and meets Donkey. It's a little strange because Shrek Forever After could probably serve as a reboot of sorts since it changes the events of the first film albeit briefly. While the very fabric of the Shrek universe is shaken to its core, it doesn't really feel like finality. Events in the film wrap up in a way that is satisfying, but it tends to feel like just another sequel rather than proper closure.The absolute highlight of the film is the montage of Shrek scaring all of the villagers after he signs the contract with Rumpelstiltskin. It's simple yet funny in its execution. It's probably the best rounded out segment of the film. Gingy tends to be pretty awesome in this one, too.While the film looks its best on Blu-ray, the animation seemed like it was a level down in comparison to films like How to Train Your Dragon and Despicable Me. It's like Shrek animation isn't as smooth or fluid or something. Facial expressions do tend to shine in Shrek films though. Those are usually better and say more than half of the things that come out of the character's mouths these days. Donkey's hair was really detailed, as well. All of its matted and tangled glory takes a front seat on Blu-ray.Shrek Forever After does have glimpses of hilarity and solidarity, but mostly comes off as halfhearted. The sequels could never really put together the same formula that made the first film so entertaining. Although mildly cute, slightly entertaining, and rather profitable, Shrek Forever After will more than likely help you understand why the franchise ended rather than reminisce about Shrek's previous adventures."
58,Shrek Forever After,,19 January 2011,"I was prepared to be bored, but this one is actually pretty good.","This movie borrows greatly from two other fables, the James Stewart movie ""It's a Wonderful World"", where he finds out what the world would be like if he never had been born, and the old Rumplestiltskin fable.Mike Myers is of course back as the voice of Shrek. After some glimpses back at what happened in the earlier Shrek movies, we see him encounter a new, strange little man, Rumplestiltskin, who makes him a deal that seems too good to be true. Shrek had just had a difficult day, with a crowd, a party, his triplets, and his wife, Fiona, and just wished his life could be the way it used to be. Rumplestiltskin would grant this request, give him a whole day of peace, in exchange for just one day of Shrek's life. Contract signed, Shrek gave up the day he was born, which means he had never been born, and the world he knew became much worse for it.A much ""darker"" story, but as it unfolds becomes quite interesting.Eddie Murphy is back as the talking Donkey, Cameron Diaz is back as Princess Fiona, and Antonio Banderas is back as Puss in Boots. The marvelous new character is Walt Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin.SPOILERS: When Shrek starts to investigate this new world of his he comes upon a band of Ogres where he is now the small one, and to his surprise their leader is Fiona. But Fiona doesn't know him, and the only way the spell can be broken is if he kisses his ""true love"" before daybreak. When he finally convinces Fiona to kiss him, nothing happens, because she has not yet come to love him. Then in a battle with Rumplestiltskin Shrek sacrifices himself for the good of all the other Ogres, Fiona falls in love with him, kisses him at the very last second, restoring the world they once knew, with Rumplestiltskin done for."
59,Shrek Forever After,7,18 January 2011,"Decent: not as good as the first two, but better than the third film","The first Shrek was funny and original, and one of my favourites of its year. The first sequel was just as delightful and as charming, and while the third film wasn't as bad as I thought it would be it did suffer from being too tired and contrived. Shrek Forever After is an improvement on Shrek the Third while lacking the charm, heart and magic that was there clearly in the first two.Thankfully, the story is not as contrived as it was in the third film. I loved the idea and it did start off well, the ""what would life be like if Shrek had never existed?"" reminded me of one of my all-time favourites, It's a Wonderful Life. However, in the middle act it did have its predictable parts. The pace sags a bit too in the middle act particularly when there are parts that don't have as much humour as I would have liked. Also, while the animation was very good on the whole, I did feel that Rumplestiltskin's facial expressions were occasionally overdone and forced.Criticisms aside, the animation is very good, very colourful and lively with some nice backgrounds. The soundtrack is also great, while the jokes are fresher and wittier than the last one, Donkey getting the best of them. The characters are still likable, the pace is in general snappy and the writing is amusing. The voice acting is also top notch, not only from Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz who are rock-solid but especially from Eddie Murphy who seamlessly comes very close to stealing the film while Antonio Banderas makes a welcome return as Puss.Overall, not a classic but an improvement and an entertaining film. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
60,Shrek Forever After,8,25 December 2010,Shrek stills rocks !,"I took me a little long to finally watch this great film , and now I just don't understand why people badmouthed this movie. It's so fine , so emotional ! Shrek has undergone through a lot of changes as the years passed , and now he's a little bored with his middle class life ... Genius script , perfect animation , a little dark (for good !) , very existentialist , amazing soundtrack , and this parallel universe touch aways works for me ! I only hope it's not the real end for the green monster saga .. The new characters are also captivating , and the cast as usual has made a very fine work . Shrek is intelligent life on animation planet , no doubt about it. And if that's really the final part , I hope the producers strike again in the future with something as original and refreshing as this lovely saga has been . Shrek FOREVER !!"
61,Shrek Forever After,8,21 December 2010,Shrek is back,"If I ask 10 people the question "" Are you a fan of Shrek??"" , 9 would eagerly reply ""YES"". Shrek has become one of the most ugliest yet interesting animation characters in recent times, loved by many which again and again proved by the box office numbers. If I rate the 4 movies of Shrek up to now Shrek 1&2 holds the first two positions and 4 will be in 3rd place. Shrek the 3rd was not quite up to where we wanted it to be. However the final installment ""Shrek forever and after"" has something's good about it.""Shrek forever after"" takes the story further ahead. Shrek being a father of 3 ogre kids and slowly drifting in to a monotonous life while loosing time for all his earlier favorite life style. Ultimately he reaches his boiling point and start to think that if nothing ever happened the way it did he must have being better off. At this moment the evil deal-maker Rumpelstiltskin steps in and strikes a deal with Shrek. Shrek accepting his deal without knowing the risks get trapped in the past while Rumpelstiltskin wins the land far far away and turns it in to his empire with his evil Witch army.Out of all the characters in this edition for me Rumpelstiltskin is a wonder. From his concept to the animation and voice is wonderful. A pure bred evil in a small sized package! Not to mention the soundtrack of this movie is also quite the thing like in all other Shrek movies. And this time it includes hits like Hello from Lionel Richie , Top of the world from Carpenters and I'm a believer by Weezer. And the stunning animation quality just like always will keep you at the edge of your seat from the very beginning.Don't think you have to real think that hard decide if to watch this or not. The obvious decision is YES."
62,Shrek Forever After,5,11 December 2010,Shrek Forever After: The Final Chapter,"The first two computer animated films were great, the third film was fun but not as good, and this final film in the story is an improvement on the predecessor, also being the only one in 3D. Basically the film starts with the past where the Queen Lillian (Dame Julie Andrews) and King Harold (John Cleese) almost signed a deal with Rumplestitlskin (Walt Dohrn) before they found out about Shrek (Mike Myers) rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Forward to the present, Shrek is getting tired of the same repetitive life he is having with his wife and three ogre triplets, Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and all the fairytale friends hanging round doesn't help his stress level either. It is at the birthday party of the three babies that lets out his big roar of frustration, and storms off to get some peace, and that is when he meets Rumplestiltskin. He offers Shrek the chance to become the former ogre he used to be for one day, feared and lonely, using a day from his past he wouldn't have any memory of, and he signs the deal. So Shrek has some fun scaring people, but then he gets captured by witches, working for Rumplestiltskin, and he realises that Donkey doesn't recognise him because the day he was born hasn't happened, and also that his life will end when the one day deal is up. So when they escape, Shrek does eventually convince Donkey to help him get back to the normal world, and they have the contract folded in a certain way to reveal how. They determine that Shrek needs to find Fiona and share true love's first kiss once again, and they only find her beneath the ground, with many other ogres who have formed a resistance. Fiona, also not knowing Shrek, reveals that no-one rescued her, she just escaped the castle herself, and she is still cursed, and the only way she will be convinced to love Shrek once again is to charm her all over again. Hearing that Rumplestiltskin will offer any wish to whoever brings Shrek in, he hands himself in, and demands that he grant his wish to have all ogres released, of course Fiona isn't. Donkey, the fattened Puss in Boots and the ogre resistance go to the rescue, and they thwart Rumplestiltskin's plan, and when it looks like Shrek is disappearing from existence, Fiona, having fallen for him again, kisses him. In the end, everything goes back to normal, Shrek realises how much his friends and family mean to him, and everyone does indeed live happily ever after. Also starring Jon Hamm as Brogan, Glee's Jane Lynch as Gretched, Craig Robinson as Cookie, Larry King as Doris the Ugly Stepsister, Kathy Griffin as Dancing Witch and Mary Kay Place as Guard Witch. The voices are still good, although Rumplestiltskin could have been someone we actually know, the computer animation is still good quality, and the It's a Wonderful Life style storyline is much better than the previous, all in all, a fun final animated fantasy comedy adventure. Worth watching!"
63,Shrek Forever After,8,10 December 2010,Mindless Entertainment!,I actually liked this movie better than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed the first three so I didn't know what to expect with the fourth one. U think this movie is the weakest one of the series but I still enjoyed it very much. I even though the trailer for this looked lame.Shrek is getting annoyed about how is family life is. He wishes for one day he can be a real ogre again. He meets the Rumpelstiltskin and he grants Shrek's wish. However all the creatures he knows don't exist anymore and he has 24 hours to set everything right.Well we all know what to expect from the voice actors. Eddie Murphy as Donkey still gave me quite a few laughs.This movie is perfect on the way it ended the series. It's by means not even close to perfect but it was still enjoyable. I rate this film 8/10.
64,Shrek Forever After,,28 September 2010,Tired of the same old jokes,"This film is about Shrek the ogre missing his old days when he was an ogre that people feared. He signs a magical contract with grave consequences, and he had to rectify his mistake.The beginning of ""Shrek Forever After"" was not so promising, as the scenes were filled with the same jokes over and over again. And the jokes, which consists of mostly belching and other annoying things, were not even that funny. After the unpromising start, the film remains dull and unfunny. The plot is thin, even considering that I know I am not watching an Oscar worthy film. The jokes and novelties are wearing thin, and they should have stopped at ""Shrek the Third""."
65,Shrek Forever After,5,16 July 2010,'My angry wig'...........,"Shrek is back and this time he's three dimensional, just another gimmick to get the crowds in to a film that may not do well due to other competition.Shrek is living the perfect life, he has Fiona, family and his friends, but soon becomes aware that life has become very repetitive and boring. After an argument, he meets with Rumpelstiltskin and makes a deal so he can be an ogre for a day.Unbeknown to him, the day from his past that he wanted to lose, was the day he was born, so he has no family, no friends and no wife. He has until the end of the day, to snatch a kiss from his true love, but Fiona is different now and it will take a lot for him to convince her....During the first ten minutes, we see Shrek become increasingly aware of how boring his life has become, he looks bored, and one can only assume that Myers had the same look on his face whilst doing the voice over.Even though this film is purely about Shreks quest to get back everything, he seems to be playing second fiddle again to other characters, and it gets apparent when it becomes boring whenever Shrek is Alone on screen without a sidekick (which is a scary notion when you become of the titular character).The story just makes Shrek seem selfish and ignorant, and there were times in the movie when i hoped he would fail his mission.Rumpelstiltskin is very annoying too, he looks and acts like a reject from the X factor who thinks he could win.on the plus side, Donkey and Puss-in-boots are fantastic and provide the few laughs the film has too offer.It's a shame that this supposedly final film is just as bad as the third entry.And the final love in during the credits showing parts from the last three movies is stolen from Lethal weapon 4.I bet Mel would be straight on the phone to complain."
66,Shrek Forever After,10,24 May 2010,The best of the Shrek sequels.,"Everyone has different taste when it comes to movies, but myself being a fan of Shrek since the first one, I think the newest chapter is the best sequel of all. I honestly did not think very much of it at first when I saw the previews and other reviews. I always like when a movie turns out better than you expected. The newest chapter finds Shrek getting bored with his married life, so he turns to Rumplestilsken to give him what he wants. One day to be the ogre he used to be when people were afraid of him. One day of not knowing the life he does in the present like being married and feeling smothered by everyone around him. But the evil Rumple has Shrek sign a contract with a trick clause that will change Shrek's life for the worse. In his new life no one knows who he is.Not Fiona, donkey or even puss in boots. The only way to break the curse is to make Fiona fall in love with him again and make everything go back to the way it was.The final Shrek has moments of action and humor like the first three movies, but I think the story is the best of the sequels. It of course makes you realize in life to love what you have. You may not always be happy with the way things are but at least you have friends and family around you who love you for who you are. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. I think adults will like it as well. And as far as the summer season goes with it's new batch of movies, you can't go wrong with Shrek. It is definitely a good start."
67,Shrek Forever After,1,22 May 2010,Shrek Forever After's Racist Comment,"Using the derogatory word ""cracker"" in a G-Rated movie that is meant for the whole family to watch is unacceptable. I am appalled and saddened that DreamWorks Animation would allow this racist name calling. To think it was suppose to be a ""joke"". Do you think using insulting words about someone's race is funny? Do you think this is appropriate for our children? If so, then DreamWorks Animation should change its target audience and movie rating because it has no business entertaining our children. Our country has come too far with easing racial issues to use it as a punch-line. Or maybe because it was making fun of Caucasians, it was considered okay. We all know that if the N-word was used that this movie would not have been produced. However, this is not about the double standards our country has about racism, but about the mere fact that a slang word was used to make fun of someone's race. The public deserves an apologize. It deserves an apologize from DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Kalzenberg (CEO), Mike Mitchell (Director), Josh Klausner (Writer), Darren Lemke (Writer), and the cast. Each and everyone of these individuals mentioned above had an opportunity to stand up for what was right and say that this is unacceptable. To make matters worse this racist word was used in a kid's movie. Maybe for the company's sake the public will forgive you for this poor lack of judgment, however, this is the last movie my family and I watch that is produced by DreamWorks Animation."
68,Shrek Forever After,8,25 May 2010,All good things have to come to an end.,"I like Shrek 1 and 2, but part 3 was so annoyingly bland. But Shrek Forever After makes up for that, it had great animation, and a great story also.Shrek and Fiona are settling in family life with there three kids. But the stress of everyday family life begins to catch up with Shrek. And he begins to miss the old days. Ends up running into Rumplestillsken and makes a deal to have a day to himself, but Shrek quickly discovers that he signed his whole life away, and that Donkey, Puss N' Boots, and Fiona don't know him. And Shrek has a whole day to get his life back or he will be erased out existence.Mike Myers is always good, as the voice of the lovable but cantankerous ogre Shrek, Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas are good in there returning voices as Donkey, Fiona, and Puss N' Boots. And not mention Walt Dornm, Jon Hamm, Craig Robinson, and Jane Lynch, are memorable also. It's a shame that this is the final chapter, but I like I said all good things have to come to an end."
69,Shrek Forever After,8,21 May 2010,Not for children under 6,"I'm writing this review because the preview on television only shows the funny parts. I took my 4 year old daughter to this movie thinking it was going to be a humorous, silly movie. It was great for about 10 minutes until the plot changed to a dark scary movie. I don't want to give away too much but the violence and weapons have a very real, non-cartoonish quality to them. There is a point where Shrek gets captured and what happens to him is so horrible my daughter turns to me with tears rolling down her cheeks and asks ""Daddy, is Shrek going to be okay?"". My heart sank. I regret taking her to it. It continued with the violence until the last 5 minutes of the movie. I wish they would have shown some of the violence on the previews because I wouldn't have spent $30 just to scare the crap out of my daughter and make her cry. I wouldn't recommend this movie for children under 6. The high quality of the animation adds to the scariness."
70,Shrek Forever After,,23 May 2010,movies,"I loved the first Shrek. It was part of my childhood growing up. The second was when I was a teenager. The second one was just as good as the first one. Third one was a huge let down for me. As was this one.Part of the reason why I liked this was because the whole cast return to do their character voices. So it's great that no one pulled out, fantastic! The problem with this movie is the humor falls flat as does the plot and characters. The first two we would understand and feel something for the characters. in this one you just don't care not one little bit. I wont explain the plot, but you will see what I mean. The whole plo9t just seemed pointless. It all ended up being predictable and you knew exactly what was going to happen. SOMETIMES things can be predictable and fun, in this one it's just predictable and stupid.I really don't know what else to say. The script was badly written. Only thing I can recommend this for is if you are Shrek Die hard Fans who will love the characters no matter what! 4/10 Was the above review useful to you? http://diethealth.weebly.com"
71,Shrek Forever After,5,26 May 2010,"Cat-tastrophe, ri-Donkey-lous and un-Shrek-able!","What is the first reason that makes you go to see Shrek? For me, I expect cheerful atmosphere all over, that simple! In thiz fourth installment of Shrek, everything becomes darker and gloomier. I think the key factor that made Shrek franchise so successful all these times is Andrew Adamson. Adamson was the Director of two early ones ""Shrek"" (2001) and ""Shrek 2"" (2004). And he also contributed writing credit in ""Shrek the Third"" (2007). Thiz time to continue thiz three years occasion without his involvement, Shrek is just about get into the nightmare. The directing is handed to Mike Mitchell. Mitchell is previously known as the Director of ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" (1999) and ""Sky High"" (2005) which are not animation features. The story tries to reset everything from the beginning. It tells Shrek (Mike Myers) travels to the past and faces the new alternate universe, where Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is a warrior, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) now is a fat lazy cat, and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) doesn't even know Shrek at all. All happens because of a bad intention of a new villain named Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) who has an ambition to rule Far Far Away Kingdom. Thiz character is not developed well. The only funny moment is only when he eventually changes his silly wig. It's not comparable to Lord Farquaad's character in the first ""Shrek"". If we look back the Shrek series in overall, it has been already downhill since the second one. The first ""Shrek"" was amazingly fun, ""Shrek 2"" was still impressive and we had ever thought that ""Shrek the Third"" would be a real forever after. I describes thiz one as no need extension. However, Shrek movies always are filled with joyful Soundtracks. If only they have a fresh idea, they can continue thiz franchise, but if they don't, please just left thiz franchise behind for a little while. The thing is they don't realize that they may kill thiz franchise forever after. One thing is for sure, thiz one really becomes a ""Cat-tastrophe"" and ""ri-Donkey-lous"" movie."
72,Shrek Forever After,5,12 July 2010,Fourth Shrek Film Is Enjoyable But Undistinguished Animated Fare,"Bored with his family life Shrek yearns for the time when he was a fearsome ogre, and signs an ill-advised deal with Rumpelstiltskin to get his old life back for a day. But this changes history, makes Rumpelstiltskin the King of Far Far Away, and Shrek must figure out how to turn back time and win his true love Fiona's heart all over again.The fourth movie in the Shrek series is affable, pleasant and as beautifully animated as the previous films. I like the way these movies are slightly less wholesome than Pixar's, with plenty of bodily functions and more neurotic characters, and the kingdom of Far Far Away is always a funny place to visit. However, as always with sequels, there is a law of diminishing returns. The movie has some funny twists, like making Puss In Boots a big bloated fatso, and the romantic theme has plenty of heart, but it's just not as much fun as the original picture. The voice cast all return and enjoy themselves, and as usual Murphy steals the show as the lovable Donkey. There's also a fine score by series composer Harry Gregson-Williams and as in the previous films some amusing pop song interludes mixed in - notably Top Of The World by The Carpenters and For Once In My Life by Stevie Wonder. A good movie for kids and undiscerning animation enthusiasts, but I think this particular fairy tale might come to an end now. Shot in digital 3D with a big 2.35:1 aspect ratio for an animated feature; this review is of the conventional print since I don't think I believe in all that 3D gimmickry."
73,Shrek Forever After,10,5 July 2010,An excellent finish to the Shrek series.,"At first, I did not know there was going to be a new Shrek movie. So my mom and I went to see it in 3D, and we love it. And it was my mom's first 3D movie.The film starts where it left off from the ""The Third."" Shrek starts to adjust to domesticated life with his wife Fiona and their ogre triplets. But he started to miss the old days when ogres were feared and hunted. And things got out of hand at the triplets' first birthday party, when the famous ogre goes into a beastly rage. When walking home, Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who offers him a day to feel like a real ogre again, in exchange for a day from Shrek's childhood which Shrek wouldn't remember in the first place. Suspicious but happy at the prospect of a relaxing vacation, Shrek signs the contract, and abruptly lands in a world where he is still feared by villagers. Shrek enjoys causing ogreish mischief before he sees wanted signs for him and Fiona and discovers that his home has become a deserted tree stump.Shrek is attacked by a group of witches and knocked unconscious. Shrek wakes up in a cage being hauled by an ungroomed Donkey, who does not recognize Shrek. Shrek is brought to Rumpelstiltskin, now king of Far Far Away. Rumpelstiltskin reveals that the day Shrek traded away was the day he was born. Since he was never born, Fiona was never rescued, and Queen Lillian and King Harold had signed a contract (as they were about to do in the flashback in the film's beginning) that would make ""all of their problems disappear,"" causing them to literally disappear; thus, Rumpelstiltskin took over, and has enslaved the ogre population. Rumpelstiltskin then reveals that when his day is up, Shrek will be erased from existence as well. Shrek then steals a broom and escapes with Donkey. Though Donkey is initially afraid of Shrek, he reveals to him the escape clause of Rumpelstiltskin's contract later: if Shrek receives ""True Love's First Kiss"", the contract will be rendered null and void. And that is all I am telling you folks - you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends, and also, I think it is an excellent finish to the Shrek series."
74,Shrek Forever After,7,22 June 2010,Lower than expectations...,"Shrek was a huge part of my childhood. All three were hilarious and not really targeted to children; all three were more for adults. However, I felt that ""adult-in-a-kids-movie"" feeling you sometimes get. You know, when they make a stupid joke and all the kids laugh, but the parents don't?I got that awkward feeling many times. I also would have loved to see the older characters as well. I feel that would have completed it. I mean, needless to say, Puss-N-Boots and Donkey made me LOL, and the storyline was great, but if I took a step back and just looked at the whole movie, it did not meet expectations. It was not as funny which took away from the whole experience. To me the movies got progressively less funny. Despite the negative review, I did not hate it, and if you've never seen the other 3 Shrek movies, you might actually enjoy this. However when it comes to Shrek standards and my standards, it gets close but not quite there."
75,Shrek Forever After,1,4 June 2010,Did the writers even SEE Shrek 2?,"It's not a HUGE spoiler, but I'll check the box just to be safe.So anyways, Shrek 4 movie had all the visuals of a great movie. Outstanding animation, great digital cinematography, an entire world created by the animators, great directing, etc. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say the story line was pretty good-it had its twists and turns, almost like the original two Shrek films!If the writers of Shrek 4 see this review, they'll definitely slap themselves silly on how they missed such a HUGE plot hole caused by Shrek 2. In Shrek 2, Fiona's parents arranged her marriage with the Fairy Godmother's son, Prince Charming. So, if Shrek hadn't come to rescue Fiona from the tower, Prince Charming would soon enough. She wouldn't escape by herself. Besides that infuriating plot hole, the writers lacked the magic of the original two Shrek films. It may be that kids movies writers nowadays would be afraid to have a line saying ""I can get you a prince with a sexy tush!"" but part of the magic of the original two Shrek movies were the original, if sometimes on the dirty side, gags which Shrek 4 almost totally lacked.If you were a fan of the original Shrek movie and you hoped from the reviews that this movie was a departure from Shrek 3, I'm sad to say that in some ways it is (i.e. plot line), but in most ways it's not (i.e. unoriginal gags). In comparison to other recent kids movies (Monsters vs. Aliens, Bee Movie) this is quite a bit better, but still don't expect much. I'm in a good mood so I'll give it a 6."
76,Shrek Forever After,5,2 June 2010,"Though better than the previous installment, Shrek Forever After fails to revive the magic of the original","After Shrek the Third, I must say, I went into this with extremely low expectations. With an amazing first film and an equally amazing sequel, I'm probably not the only one who felt shafted by the third film in the series. After seeing Forever After, I can safely say that it exceeded my expectations.However, just because it improves over the third one does NOT make it a worthy predecessor of Shrek and Shrek 2. The story is very clever and engaging, yet at times feels rushed and careless. It's as if they simply didn't care about making Shrek go out on the same level it came in. On the other hand, it was a very interesting idea and there were some times when we got a glimpse of an almost return-to-form for the series, as short-lived as these moments were.My biggest complaint about the movie involves the characters. One of the key factors to the success of the previous movies were its fun and unique array of characters (especially Donkey, who is arguably the most popular character in the whole series). However, in this entry into the franchise, it seems as if these characters were pushed to the side, and the movie seemed to solely focus on Shrek. Now, I know he's the main protagonist and the namesake of the films, but the element that kept the entire series so fresh was its variety of characters. I was pretty saddened when I saw great characters like Puss in Boots and Donkey go from co-leads to minor characters. Even when they were on screen, the chemistry just didn't seem to be there. In the previous films (even in the third one), there is very strong chemistry between all of the film's main characters. In this one, it all feels a bit forced and doesn't have the same kind of emotional appeal as the others did.The lack of chemistry may also stem from a rather lackluster performance from some of the leads, most notably Mike Meyers as Shrek. I was very disappointed in his performance, to say the least. Having just recently watched the first two, it's impossible not to compare them all. I may not be able to speak for everybody, but in my opinion, Mike Meyers has considerably less enthusiasm and emotion with his character as he did before. He has turned Shrek, a disgustingly funny, yet lovable, character into a droll and lifeless shell of his former self.However, though some of the actors fell short of expectations, some actors shined. Walt Dohrn was absolutely BRILLIANT as Rumpelstiltskin. He put a fun and interesting twist on an old character and made him fresh and entertaining. He had just the right voice and attitude for the character, and it was obvious he was very passionate about the role and put a lot of emotion into it.So, all in all, Shrek Forever After was a welcome step-up over its immediate predecessor, yet a rushed story, lack of chemistry, and a less-than-stellar performance by Mike Myers kept it from coming anywhere close to the bar set by the first and second films in the series.I guess Shrek was right in the movie; he just isn't the same ogre he was before."
77,Shrek Forever After,,31 May 2010,Shrek 4never is Awful,"Want a movie that is chalked filled with jokes that fall flat? Go see Shrek 4never.Ever wonder why Hollywood is rebooting everything and spinning off bad TV shows? Well, they're clearly out of good ideas. More proof is green-lighting a fourth Shrek movie that's this bad. There's no way you can tell me that any studio exec read the treatment for this animated turd and thought it was a good idea for an entertaining film. They simply crunched the money numbers and ordered the standard grab for the wallet. Too bad I fell for it like a lot of people probably will. When will I learn my lesson? As crazed and even cruel as it sounds, just kill Shrek already. Put him out of our misery. Better yet, let this truly be his ride in to the sunset. I prefer to think of him in better days like after his first two hits and not the sad irrelevant character driven in to the ground by two bad films. No creativity left, nothings new. The first in the series was incredible but Dreamworks needs to please move on to better ideas or at least hire better writers.So much for the old phrase ""quit while you're ahead."" Quit after you've sucked every golden egg from the tired golden goose until you kill it might be the creators of Shrek's philosophy."
78,Shrek Forever After,5,31 May 2010,Disappointing!,"Like most people, I loved the first 2 Shrek movies, and even though I don't remember much about the third one, I was still expecting this one to be funny since I remember laughing so hard with #2. Sadly, I didn't think it was funny at all! If anything, it was too dark and serious as Shrek, unhappy with his married life, sets off to go rediscover himself in a bleak alternate universe. The characters felt like nothing new, we've seen them 3 times now and there's nothing much interesting about them this time around. No one had anything funny to say, and most of the jokes were already seen in the trailer. The new villain was decent, Rumpelstiltskin, but other than him there weren't any new characters at all, at least not any memorable ones.I'd put this one in the ""wait to see it on DVD"" category if you're a big Shrek fan."
79,Shrek Forever After,7,18 September 2017,The final chapter of a great movie series,"This is the last of the four SHREK movies, and it's a great conclusion of the saga.Here Shrek lives a regular life with Fiona and their three sons, but every day is always the same again and again, and he is nostalgic of his good old days, when he was feared by everyone. After exploding of anger at their sons' birthday party, he is tricked by the evil Rumpelstilskin that makes Shrek signing a deal that he would have lived just a day like a real ogre.At the beginning it's all OK, feared and hunted by everyone, but he soon discovers that he ended in an alternative reality, where he wasn't even born. Consequently Donkey doesn't know who is his best friend, Fiona never met him and Puss is fat. And, Rumpel rules supreme Far Far Away, with witches (and then the Pied- Piper) at his orders. Soon Shrek befriends a group of fighting ogres with Fiona as their commander, and with Puss and Donkey's regained friendship, they all fight Rumpel's kingdom and Shrek can share his true love kiss with Fiona, and the spell is broken.This movie follows the footsteps of ''It's a Wonderful Life'', with Shrek in the James Stewart role, only in a darker way and with no custodian angels. And in the ending credits there is a brief summary of the previous three movies, with some scenes mixed with the names of the crew members.The first Shrek was excellent (and I also wrote a long review on it), the second was funny and enjoyable, the third... I found it also amusing and funny, although it received poor reviews by different websites and newspaper critics, and this is also highly enjoyable.The animation is always great in every detail, the soundtrack is always outstanding (and the movie ends with Weezer's cover of ''I am a Believer'', the hit song of the first movie), and the actors are, as always, well suited in their roles, especially Walt Dorn as Rumpelstilskin and Eddie Murphy as Donkey, my favorite character.I recommend this movie to all fans of the series."
80,Shrek Forever After,7,10 April 2017,A nice ending to the Shrek series,"Granted Shrek Forever After may not be as good as the first two movies but it's an improvement of Shrek the Third which disappointed many fans. But Shrek Forever After gave a nice ending to Shrek and I think it deserves more credit and a higher rating on IMDb because it has a good story, good comedy and a good villain (Rumpelstiltskin). I like how it starts off with the King and Queen of Far Far Away almost making a deal with Rumpelstiltskin in order to break Princess Fiona's curse but the deal is interrupted when they find out the Shrek saved Fiona. Rumpel becomes vengeful because of Shrek and wishes he was never born. Then we see that Shrek misses the days when he used to be a real ogre even though Fiona tells him he has everything. Then Shrek meets Rumpelstiltskin and is tricked into signing a contract with Rumpel thinking that it will give him just one day to be a real ogre. At first, Shrek is thrilled because villagers are afraid of him and he can do whatever he wants. But then Shrek finds out he's been taken to an alternative reality and sees how things would've turned out if he was never born. Like Donkey is afraid of Shrek, Shrek and Fiona have never met, Puss is fat and Rumpel is in charge of the Kingdom of Far Far Away. And the only way Shrek can get his life back is sharing True Love's Kiss with Fiona.Granted Shrek Forever After uses the same kind of story as It's a Wonderful Life but I think it deserves more praise because I like how it shows what everything would be like if Shrek never saved Fiona from the Dragon's Keep. And I like in the end, Shrek realizes that his life is perfect because he has friends and family."
81,Shrek Forever After,8,16 February 2017,A somewhat darker fourth instalment,"Shrek, the ogre who was once feared throughout the land, is now living an ordinary life with his wife Fiona and their three children but sometimes he misses his old life and finally during his children's birthday party he has had enough and storms out. Soon afterwards he 'rescues' the evil Rumpelstiltskin and afterwards as they talk he says he would like just one day of his old life. Rumpelstiltskin says he can give him that in exchange for one other day in his life, a day he can't even remember. Shrek can't see any catch so signs the deal.Suddenly he finds himself in an unfamiliar world; at first it is great, everybody fears him again, but then he realises there is something very wrong. He is captured by witches who take him to the castle in a cart pulled by Donkey who has no memory of Shrek. Once at the castle he finds that Rumpelstiltskin now rules. He is told that the day he gave up was the day he was born; after the one day he asked for he will cease to exist! In this world he was never born so he didn't befriend Donkey and Puss in Boots. He didn't rescue Fiona. And the King and Queen were tricked into a deal that gave the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. All hope isn't lost though; there is a get out clause 'True Love's Kiss' will save him. This isn't easy though; not only will he have to find Fiona he will have to make her fall in love with him once again all in one day.After a slightly disappointing third instalment this is a step up; it still isn't quite as good as the first two films but that would be difficult. The story is quite a lot darker as we see Shrek make a mistake that costs him everything he holds dear and could potentially lose his life. This adds a sense of urgency to proceedings and makes each step towards fixing things satisfying. The fact that Shrek hasn't impacted on their lives means familiar characters have changed; most notable Fiona who, after escaping from the tower on her own, has become a warrior princess leading an ogre rebellion against Rumpelstiltskin and Puss who is fat! Rumpelstiltskin is the most villainous of the antagonists in the 'Shrek' films to date; he is genuinely unpleasant and may disturb some younger viewers I thought he was a great character though. The animation is good, as one might expect, although some scenes look as though they were done to show off 3D effects which may have looked great in the cinema but merely look good when watched on DVD. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the series even if part three disappointed them."
82,Shrek Forever After,8,3 February 2017,Awesome movie,"This film is really good. It has great CGI, voice acting, and a story that's actually pretty great, even though it can get stale at some points. This film is hilarious, and a great comeback from the 3rd movie. The reason I say that is because the 3rd film, while it was still great, had a lot of flaws. However, this film gets back on the right track. Though this film isn't as amazing as the first 2 films, it shows a lot of promise for future possible Shrek films. I will be honest and say that the story of this film can feel a little bit stale. But besides that, it's still pretty great. I think this film fits perfectly in the Shrek film series. I was pleasantly surprised and I recommend it to anyone who likes Shrek."
83,Shrek Forever After,6,8 January 2017,Strictly for the fans of the series to see it all happen just once more,"Reviewed January 2012One way to come out of the bad vibe the third installment created is to give the fans exactly what they want. This one does just that by revisiting all the familiar places and times. To an extent it succeeds in holding the attention of the viewer but could not sustain all the way through. Shrek is in a midlife crisis and looks for a chance to have his untamed life back once more and meets up a sorcerer who offers him one day of his wish if he gives up a day of his past. This past day ends up being the day of Shrek's birth making him nonexistent for the entire past except for today. So the alternative universe he now traverses through has Fiona he never saved or the donkey he never met. The entire setup was a ruse for the sorcerer to take away the kingdom Far far away. There is a rebellion head by Fiona to end this tyranny in which Shrek joins to get close to Fiona. So it all starts back again as Shrek once again tries to make Fiona fall for him, learns the value of friendship and such. It is exciting and boring at the same time. It has it's heart at the right place but the execution gives away the makers attempt to win back it's audience by trying too hard. Shrek should be contempt that he hopefully got a better ending than his previous outing and they should stop making anymore of it. Strictly for the fans of the series to see it all happen just once more."
84,Shrek Forever After,9,22 November 2016,Not a movie for children,"Warning: the following dialogue, taken from this movie, is not suitable for children and contains spoilers. You have been warned. ""S-Shrek-chan I don't think I'm ready.. I've never been with an ogre before"" ""It's okay laddie"" Shrek said in an understanding tone. ""We're safe in mah swamp. No one has to know""Jesus thought long and hard about this. His stiff member was reminding him how long it had been since he was with a woman. However, in the back of his mind he knew Shrek was just using him to satisfy his ogre needs. Though, a part of him wanted to be used. A part of him needed to be used.""Oh Shrek Can you sing that song I like to set the mood first?"" Jesus asked hopefully.""Of course laddie. After all I did study opera at Julliard.""Shrek began singing with his angelic voice a haunting tune that had been passed down among the swamp folk for generations. ""Hey now You're an allstar. Get your game on. Go play. Hey now, you're a rock star. Get the show on. Get paid. All that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars break the mold""""Clean up on aisle my panties"" Jesus said seductively. He went in for the kiss.Shrek stopped singing and they shared a passionate kiss but Shrek broke away.""When are you going to tell your father that we're together?"" Shrek asked concerned.""I..I don't know Can't we just make love?""""You need to come out to your father Jesus Better out than in I always say""""Shrek-chan please stop I don't want to think about this right now!""Just then they heard a knock on the door. Shrek got up to answer it, and was confused. There was no one there, or so he thought""I'm right here!"" Barry Bee shouted. He was so small since he's a bee that Shrek couldn't see him at first.""What are yeh doin' in mah swamp?!?"" Shrek asked forcefully.""I'm sorry sir! I heard your singing from across the river and wanted to see where such a magnificent voice came from!""""Shrek-chan, who is at the door?"" Jesus asked as he approached the two."
85,Shrek Forever After,7,8 August 2016,"Shrek coming full circle with himself, to be happy, and live happily ever after... once and for all...","Concluding my review of ""Shrek the Third"", I wondered what was awaiting the green ogre for its fourth adventure. After meeting his true love, her parents, getting ready for and having children, a fourth part could only let me expect something on the level of a midlife crisis. Granted the animators have enough imagination to create something satisfying, if not overwhelming, I still didn't think I would get so close.In ""Forever After"", Shrek is in the same state we left him at the end of the third opus, enjoying his role as a father, teaching his triplets how to properly burp, waving at the tourists who visit the swamp and inviting Donkey, his hybrid kids, and Puss to tell their adventures' stories. But while his life seems to be governed by the same routine, his enthusiasm slowly fades out, he starts to question the meaning of his life, remembering the time when he was a 'wanted' ogre, not a local joke, and when he was alone and free, basically, being the Shrek we meet one decade before. In a way, he echoes the sentiment of some angry fans who miss the good old Shrek.That self-questioning Shrek reflects the way his long journey has transformed him on the surface, but not much in reality, and that's the closer you can get to a midlife crisis in animation's language. And as predictable as this premise sounds, it was perhaps the best one to conclude the monster's existential journey. In the first, he had to to discover his value as a person, as someone capable to love and be loved, and Fiona was the key to this discovery. In the second, he had to learn to love himself. In the third one, , he had to accept to be a father, to engage in a serious relationship. But this issue had less to do with his status as an ogre and this is why I failed to connect it with the previous opuses and I don't think the characters of Charming or Arthur were worthy additions.But in the fourth, we touch the essence of Shrek's personality: being an ogre, scaring people and children, living alone in a remote place, enjoying mud bath and not roaring because a chubby creepy kid asks you to do so (I admit that ""do the roar"" line stuck in my mind and became an instant favorite from the whole franchise). The two middle films questioned the 'happily ever after' assumption but with too mature issues (responsibility, family etc.) Now, an ogre who'd love to be an ogre again, that's the kind of stuff even a kid can get and enjoy, I think it was the only one that could have a fourth film work especially when it tells you that it is the final chapter, so we enjoy it even more because we know this is the last time we see this gallery of characters who visited us every three years, as it became a sort of tradition.Of course, now that Shrek has kids and all must end well that ends well, we know the journey must end with Shrek realizing how lucky he is, and to get the point, he must lose first what he took for granted and this is where the villain Rumplestitk let's just call him Rumple, makes his entrance. Rumple makes a Faustian deal with Shrek: he gets one day where he is unknown and can scare people while Rumple can take any day of Shrek's life. The problem is that ever since ""Back to the Future"", we know that Shrek is signing his own death warrant through this contract. And while Shrek isn't the brightest bulb, it's a bit frustrating not to see the scam.So what must happen happens, he enjoys a day of anonymity before realizing that life has changed for worse Biff Tannen, I mean Rumple became the king of Far Far Away. Alternate reality, that was the trick, how to make new stuff with old one. Shrek must conquer back Fiona's heart to cancel the curse (no curse without an antidote). But that's not as easy as it looks, Fiona became the leader of a group of revolutionary ogres, Donkey works for the witches who are to Rumple what the hyenas were to Scar, and the purpose of the whole second act (the less exciting one) is to allow Fiona to fall again in love with Shrek, so that Shrek can celebrate Christmas with his friends, and ""gives his petals back to Zuzu"".The second act left me a bit cold, I liked the way the usual characters behaved differently by still being true to their nature (fat Puss in Boots was fun to some extent), but it's only the third act that brings all the emotionality, the ending that the third one needed to have. I won't spoil the final lines, but they were so beautiful I wished no one would speak after that, and no one did. It was also a great nod to the first film to have ""I'm a Believer' concluding the last one, as to remind us of this 2001 year where Shrek became a cultural phenomenon, an achievement from a non-Disney character.And it's a deserved reputation because there's a Shrek in all of us, we all have personal issues, we all wish to be different, taller, skinnier, and we all question our past. I myself spend my life wishing I hadn't made this or that mistake, but then I realize that all my mistakes, one leading to another, made me meet my wife and have a beautiful daughter. So it was all worth it. I don't know if I'll live happily ever after that, but it just allows me to look forward to the future with sheer optimism.And now that Shrek has learned the lesson, we can wish him to live happily ever after, once and for all."
86,Shrek Forever After,8,14 May 2016,Good fun,"Good fun. While this probably got the worst reviews of the four Shrek movies, I enjoyed this the most. The humour seemed cleverer, and the whole plot seemed darker and edgier. Maybe it was the fact that it had an over- the-top bad guy, Rumpelstiltskin, and he made the movie for me.Great graphics, and a decent, though a tad derivative, plot. The plot was never the main selling point of the Shrek series anyway...The old crew - Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy (especially) and Antonio Banderas - deliver in spades, but as, indicated before, it is Rumpelstiltskin, voiced by Walt Dohrn, who makes this so enjoyable."
87,Shrek Forever After,7,4 December 2015,Dreamworks play safe and sign the series off with dignity.,"After the monstrosity that was Shrek the Turd, the Dreamworks team behind the Shrek franchise woke up and realised what made the series so popular in the first place. Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.Thematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!The action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7/10"
88,Shrek Forever After,4,4 June 2015,Forever Dull.,"Shrek Forever After (2010): Dir: Mike Mitchell / Voices: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Walt Dohrn: While the fairy tale spoof theme is still active, the series is clearly running out of steam. Shrek yearns for one more day to be a real ogre away from marriage, family and responsibility. He gets his wish when the evil Rumpelstiltskin tricks him into signing away the day he was born. Directed by Mike Mitchell who previously made such dread as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and Sky High. The one element that works here is the fine animation. Shrek basically repeats the first plot where he must unite with his friends. He is voiced again by Mike Myers who seems tired. Only Fiona who is seen as a warrior, has any depth but we know the outcome. She is voiced by Cameron Diaz and seems like the one character worth watching here. Donkey and Puss-In-Boots are also reduced to cardboard. Eddie Murphy voices Donkey whom almost seems exhausted from the whole thing. The whole Donkey-got-the-female-dragon-knocked-up thing is getting old and a little creepy. Antonio Banderas who voices Puss-In-Boots deserves better material to an otherwise appealing cat. Walt Dohrn voices the villain Rumpelstillskin and outside Shrek, seems to be the one other character to pay off in this pathetic sideshow. The creative department seems drained and only seems to function as an opportunity to ring every last dime out of the franchise. The original film was fresh and creative with ideas but with this fourth entry they should forget it forever and ever. Score: 4 / 10"
89,Shrek Forever After,10,27 February 2015,Perfectish joy,"Beautiful story, told brilliantly.I saw the first movie years ago, but hadn't followed the series. This is even better than the original.Everything about it hits the mark. Pace, character, humour, setbacks, tension. If there's a standout it's the hilarious Puss in Boots.A few tiny reservations. Animation for the dance scenes could be even better - the witches rave is an awesome idea and should blow the roof off. Overall there should have been some darker touches in the music selection. About halfway through the tension slacks off a nudge, I think because it feels like the Kiss is inevitable - but they pile on the trouble after that and nothing is certain.Huge entertainment. I luvsed it."
90,Shrek Forever After,7,15 August 2014,Fine conclusion,"The King and Queen was about to make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin when Fiona was saved by Shrek. He's bitter at the happily-ever-after state of affairs. Shrek and Fiona have 3 kids and he's struggling with domestication. He's tired and wants to go back to scaring the villagers. Rumpelstiltskin tricks Shrek into a deal to give him the day he was born. Shrek discovers the new world is ruled by Rumpelstiltskin, witches are running things, and ogres are hunted. He and Fiona have never met. When the day expires, he will never exist. There is an exit clause in True Love's Kiss.The start is a little bit slow. It's grumpy with a tired Shrek. New character Rumpelstiltskin isn't the most visually interesting. It does take a touching turn. It's a good 'It's a Wonderful Life' story. It has a warm message and the gang is back."
91,Shrek Forever After,4,6 August 2014,The Definitive Example of Sequalitis,"Shrek was a giant hit back in 2001, pleasing kids and adults with its parody of fairy tales. It had great 3D animation for the time and even had a little heart. Shrek 2 is one of the few animated sequels to be better than the first, actually developing the characters instead of simplifying them. It has funnier jokes, a larger scope, and genuine suspense.Me, my sister, and my mother went to both Shrek 3 and 4 in the theater. For a long time, Shrek 2 was one of our favorite family movies. Even 7 years ago, we realized that Shrek 3 was a clunker. We fooled ourselves into seeing Shrek 4, but alas, the series was essentially dead.The best part about the first two films were the character's relationships. They defied expectations, and somehow made the grouchy Shrek and annoying Donkey funny and lovable. You get to see some buildup in Shrek and Fiona's relationship, as well as their personal conflicts and tension with Fiona's royal family. Shrek 3 dropped the ball on the humor and character development, and Shrek 4 certainly didn't catch it.By being a time travel movie, all the development in the previous films is essentially thrown away. Shrek no longer has a personal problem to overcome. His biggest transgression is wishing for a day's vacation. That's it. If it weren't for the villain, his life would be fine and he'd be a well-balanced ogre.Its just an adventure movie that isn't particularly fascinating, and not even that funny. Most ironically, Shrek and Fiona's relationship has become the very thing the original was satirizing. ""True love"" isn't built in this film - its simply there, awakened if you play the role of fireman and save your lover's life. In the original, Fiona was shocked that her knight in shining armor was an ogre. They have to spend time together on their journey back to realize their true feelings. In Shrek 2, the Prince Charming is a spoiled, selfish brat, who only wants love to satisfy his own needs. Our lovers get into a big argument, but ultimately show they're willing to make sacrifices for the other's happiness, and make amends. Shrek 4 has none of this depth or awareness, and forgets that love by heroism only exists in fairy tales.Considering the wealth of options out there, there is no reason for you to see Shrek 4. It fails to capture the magic of the first two films, and is overshadowed by dozens of even mediocre animated movies. How the mighty have fallen..."
92,Shrek Forever After,,23 May 2014,Shrek Forever After,"Shrek Forever After (advertised as Shrek: The Final Chapter or Shrek 4) is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated fantasy comedy film, and the fourth and final installment in the Shrek series, produced by DreamWorks Animation. The film was released by Paramount Pictures in cinemas on May 20, 2010 in Russia and on May 21, 2010 in the United States. It was also released in 3D and IMAX 3D formats.Although the film received mixed reviews from critics and opened lower than expected, it remained as the #1 film in the United States and Canada for three consecutive weeks and has grossed a worldwide total of over $752 million, making it a commercial success. Additionally, Shrek Forever After is DreamWorks Animation's second highest-grossing film at the foreign box office surpassed only by Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.[3] It is also the second highest grossing animated film of 2010, behind Toy Story 3."
93,Shrek Forever After,3,20 December 2012,An excuse for blockbuster,"We all hate comparing things , but when a worldwide famous franchise as ""SHREK"" appears on your nearest theater , not putting the previous Dreamworks efforts into question is probably a daunting task. The first two ones were awe-inspiring and a milestone into animation films.The voice acting was superb , the characters were deep and the audience could relate with them , the OST was excellent disregarding whatever your musical taste is , and the plot was indeed an Oscar-worthy script. With the third one all those elements seemed to be there , but diminished and somewhat blurred and somehow far from the original idea.In Shrek Forever After , all those elements that made the franchise a world-class filmi are totally gone.Not a single trace of them. Shrek has turned into a dumbed-down story with clichés overused into Hollywood filmi.Putting aside the fact that Shrek 4 is carrying a heavy weight on the shoulders , on it's own it's not even an OK film , simply a forgettable summer-carry-along-your-kids blockbuster. Sure , the animation is better than ever and surpasses the other 3 filmi , but animation relies on technology and it improves and becomes better with time so the visual aspect is not a positive thing.Shame on you Dreamworks , shame on you.If you enjoyed the first 2 filmi and liked the third: A)If your expectations are low :give it a try B)If your expectations are modest:forget this one. C)If your expectations are high :forget this one."
94,Shrek Forever After,6,14 December 2011,Shrek Forever After (2010),"Usually an alternative reality plot is just a gimmick used by lazy writers. Imagine if Puss was fat, if Shrek had never been born etc. Such ideas leave limitless ideas for writers, and they don't even have to try. Shrek has always leaned toward the obvious ""what if"" scenarios. Part 2 saw Shrek and DOnkey become handsome, part 3 had Donkey and Puss trade bodies, and so on. Now an entire film is based around this idea. It shouldn't work, but it kind of does. This is certainly a step up from 3. There are more laugh out loud moments, and I even got 3 big belly laughs. The action scenes are exciting, but too concerned with 3-D, making it distracting. Like the other Shrek films before it, it has too many songs playing over the scenes. Probably hoping to shift as many copies as the fantastic Shrek 2 soundtrack. The film starts off with some great examples of Shrek's growing frustration. It's easy to see why Shrek wants his life back to normal. The quick cut montage, followed by the birthday party from hell, leads us into a believable situation where Shrek signs the deal. We also have a wonderful villain, voiced perfectly by Dohrn. This wont gain any new fans. Nor is it a satisfactory end to the franchise. What it is, is an enjoyable spin on the characters with some nice jokes."
95,Shrek Forever After,,8 August 2011,A nice end to the franchise...,"I must admit that I have a bit of a soft spot for the Shrek films. I don't know what it is; I guess I just like the brand of humour in them and (for the most part) the likable characters. The third one (I felt) was a bit of a mess, but they appear to have got it nearer the mark for the final instalment until they decide to make some more, that is. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary sponsored by 'Pete's Potions', available at all major 'Fairy Godmother' outlets nationwide.Shrek is finding it hard to cope with the routine of everyday life, the children, the visitors, the tour bus it's all getting on top of him. This all comes to a head at the kids' first birthday party where he has a big row with Fiona and storms out. He meets Rumpelstiltskin on the road and they start talking about their woes. Not knowing Rumpelstiltskin has an ulterior motive, Shrek signs a contract that sees him projected into an alternate reality, one in which he had never existed until now. He finds that nobody knows him, not Donkey, not Puss in Boots not even Fiona! It then dawns on Shrek that Rumpelstiltskin has conned him. Fortunately there's a get-out clause in the contract, but can he fulfil it before sunrise? Of course, I'm not going to tell you here or them Spoiler Police will have me back on the farm working for that no good Old MacDonald.Favourite Character  Puss in Boots (made me laugh) The animation is just what we've come to expect in these films, and, as usual, it is excellent. Just for reference, I stuck to my principles and watch it in 2D. As usual, some great tunes, particularly at the end, but generally, a decent score. All the usual voice talent was on show, and the all did a good job. So honourable mentions go to; Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots. I should also give a special mention for Walt Dohrn who did the voices for Rumpelstiltskin, Priest and Krekraw Ogre.Favourite Quote  Donkey: ""Wow, that's a big kitty!... Can we keep him?"" I'm quite glad this franchise has reached an end, not because I think they're no good any more, but I can see a day when that will be the case. As I've already said, I really get the humour in these films and I wish there were more comedies made in a similar vein. I half expected this one to be awful, if I'm honest, after the let's say less than warm reception it got from the critics. It was a pleasant surprise to find it wasn't all that bad. Yes, the Rumpelstiltskin character needed more development, but I didn't really mind. It entertained me for ninety minutes and that's all you can ask Recommended.My Score: 6.5/10.IMDb Score: 6.6/10 (30,431 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 57/100 (187 reviews counted when this review was written)."
96,Shrek Forever After,,20 July 2011,"Better than the Third, but...","Don't get me wrong: I love the first two. The Jokes were hilarious, the plot was well formed and written, and the voice actors well chosen. But the Fourth installment in the Shrek series echos the third: The Jokes fall flat, the actors are clearly tired of doing the series, and the plot-if any-is boring and tasteless. It's understandable why-The twist on fairytale movies is done. Every single story has been covered, and all of the writers have been using the same format: Villain comes back for revenge, initial hero either defeats them or fizzles out and the supporting character fixes everything. I'm not kidding, they've been using the same format since the genre was invented. Shrek, Hoodwinked, The Princess Diaries, Anastasia, Happily N'Ever After-they all have the same concept. And while it was great in its early days, it's clearly fallen short for the audience. I gotta eat some olives. Athena2264 OUT."
97,Shrek Forever After,8,7 July 2011,definite uptick in quality,"As ""Shrek Forever After"" opens, the warmhearted ogre is suffering through a bit of a midlife crisis. Having been firmly ensconced in marital and domestic bliss for quite some time now, Shrek suddenly finds himself pining for the days when he could be a real, full-time ogre, roaming the countryside and terrorizing the general populace - instead of changing diapers, pushing strollers, and signing autographs for fans who remember those long-gone glory days when he could still strike fear into the hearts of men.In the ""be careful what you wish for/you don't know what you've got till it's gone"" scenario that Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke have concocted for this fourth entry in the series, Shrek (Mike Myers) allows himself to be tricked into essentially signing his life away to the dastardly Rumpelstiltskin (the excellent Walt Dohrn) in exchange for a chance to once again become a full-fledged, undomesticated ogre for a day. We then get a new spin on ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as Shrek learns what the world would have been like had he never been born. He also has to get Fiona (Cameron Diaz)  the beautiful princess by day/ugly ogre by night who, in this alternate universe, is now the leader of a band of freedom-fighting ogres  to fall in love with him all over again.Though a definite improvement over the drab and disappointing ""Shrek the Third"" from 2007, ""Shrek Forever After,"" directed by Mike Mitchell, never quite achieves the level of cleverness and wit that the first two installments did  which is a high bar indeed for anyone in this business. Still, the mix of Fractured Fairy Tale revisionism, pop culture references and recognizable pop tunes remains a winning one for the most part, and there is just enough sentiment to lift our spirits without stranding us in a puddle of goo. Plus, all the great sidekicks are back, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), and Cookie (Craig Robinson), and the voice work and animation are, as always, first-rate. In fact the voice-over cast reads like a who's-who of well-known actors and performers: Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Jon Hamm (""Mad Men""), Jane Lynch (""Glee""), Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Meredith Vieira, Ryan Seacrest, Regis Philbin and Larry King. Not a bad little group that."
98,Shrek Forever After,,6 July 2011,Greenery.,"Basically ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for ""Shrek"" fans as our titled hero is tricked by Rumpelstiltskin to be erased from his reality and thus creating a weird and dark alternate reality. Talk about your mid-life crises. Can be looked upon as creative or down-right plagiarist, but overall an adequate continuation of the long-running series as ""Shrek Forever After"" matches the little intensity left by ""Shrek the Third"", but the first two of the series seem like distant memories now. The voice characterizations are still right on the money and the sight gags and one-liners are still strong enough to endear the film to even the harshest of legitimate critics. However, in the end many may wonder if this is the last theatrical gasp for our friend Shrek though. 4 stars out of 5."
99,Shrek Forever After,6,24 June 2011,This one was definitely better than the . . .,". . . third installment, but ""Shrek 2"" definitely remains the best of the four. At least, they took their time with ""Shrek Forever After"" to devise a pleasant twist on the tale of ""Rumpelstiltskin"" and incorporate that story into Shrek's and Fiona's. They didn't make very good use of Donkey this time around, however, which was unfortunate. Overall, it was good, as compared to the less than satisfying ""Shrek 3"", which suffered in large part from the creators rushing to capitalize on the masterful ""Shrek 2"" (which remains the best of the four). At least, the creators were able to end the story with a good one!"
100,Shrek Forever After,6,13 June 2011,doesn't really add anything to the story,"There was really no need to make this movie other than to make more money. It's not like it added anything to the Shrek story. Plus it wasn't as good and had a really short run time at well under 90 minutes. Nothing made me laugh in this, but I'm sure kids will still love it. This time, Shrek signs a deal with Rumpelstilskin to erase a day of his life so he can be a scary orge again. What he doesn't know is Rumpelstilskin has plans to take over Farawayland and be king. To do this, he must see that Shrek never saved Fiona from the dragon. So, Shrek is taken to an alternate world where he never met Fiona and must get her to fall in love again or disappear forever. Quite a few of the other characters make appearances, but Donkey is the only one given anything to do.Final Verdict: a story works good the first time, but by the third movie it's old. skip it."
101,Shrek Forever After,6,21 May 2011,A massive improvement on Shrek the Third,"When the original Shrek film came out in 2001 it was seen as a revolution, an animated film that looked pretty realistic (realistic in the context a fairy tale setting), a film that was funny, action packed, able to appeal to adults as well as children and most importantly, challenge Pixar's domination when making CGI animated films. But slowly Dreamworks and the Shrek series itself became a shadow of its former self, whilst Shrek 2 was just as good as Shrek but they also made slowly made weaker films like Flushed Away, Shark Tale, Bee Movie and Shrek the Third. But Shrek Forever After is better then Shrek the Third.Starting with a prologue the magical conman Rumpelstilskin (Walt Dohrn) very nearly got his hands on the crown of Far Far Away, when Shrek (Mike Myers) saves Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and ends up ruining Rumpelstiltskin. Years later it seems that Shrek and Fiona are living a perfect live with their children in the swamp but slowly Shrek gets bore of the routine and being a celebrity. He longs for the glories days of being a true ogre, feared and ends up making a deal with Rumpelstilskin. But of course Rumpelstilskin tricks our hero into a world where he is not born, that Rumpelstilskin is king with witches as his enforcers and ogres are hunted. None of Shrek's friends recognises him and Fiona is leading the resistance. There is only one way to break the curse, true love's kiss.The basic plot is the same as A Wonderful Life, a message about be careful of wish for and that the grass always seems greener on the other side. It is a story that has been done to death in both film and television, particularly in children's programs. But it also serves as a way to get round the fact that Shrek is meant to be a family man and should be content with his happily ever after.Whilst the plot is rudimentary Shrek Forever After is better then Shrek the Third. It is a faster paced film, the jokes are better and its most impressive feature is the action. Shrek has quite a few fights with the Witches who have some really good weapons, like the skull chains and the poison apple gas grenade (a little play on fairy tales, particularly Snow White). On of the keys to Shrek has been the pop-culture reference, but it went stupid by the third film with the medieval school. Likely Shrek Forever After tones it down a bit (since it has done everything possible) with the only major twists being the witches' nightclub and a few film reference, like the Gingerbread Man in a Gladiator parody. The best jokes involve my favourite character Puss in Boots, who turned into a flabby tabby and pampered cat, as he declined from a deadly assassin to a house pet. He has the best lines and the physical humour. You got to love the little guy. Some of the comedy did not work, like the ogre dancing and Shrek's attempts to woo Fiona. But at least the film was more focused then Shrek the Third and Rumpelstilskin is a better villain then Prince Charming, but still not as good or interesting as the villains in the first two films.Like the previous films the animation is crisp, looks realistic and great following movements. Director Mike Mitchell is a live action director, but he adapted to animation and provided family friendly action scenes. There was some dodgy moments, like a witch prostitute (because that what children's films need, sex workers). Mitchell ensured that there was a emotional heart to the film, Shrek trying to woo back Fiona, something lacking in the third film.Shrek Forever After is meant to be the last film of series, but I don't believe it. We all know how Hollywood works, keep making films until the money runs dry. We already got a Puss in Boots spin-off on the way."
102,Shrek Forever After,6,22 April 2011,Shrek Forever After,"Shrek 4, or, the It's a Wonderful Life episode of the series, is the worst of the series.Don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, it's fun, but it's stupid. I may be the only one that thinks Shrek the Third is better.The first 85 minutes are good (7/10) but after that, it just got crazy. It was the first time I really notice Shrek lost it's ways. I mean in the beginning, Shrek was original, spoofing fairy tales, it was funny! Now, Rumpelstiltskin is a regular character. Yeah.It's not that it's bad, it's just sad. The fact that Shrek has lowered itself so much. Crazy."
103,Shrek Forever After,6,22 March 2011,Ogre forever after,"Its relief after Shrek third. It has good fairy tale story all about true love kiss. I like the way they used magical things in the story. It has good humor if we compare to Shrek Third it is better than it.Shrek bored with his life ends up in the treachery magical contact which makes realize his mistake and importance of family , love and friends He has to once again have to kiss Fiona and there kiss will broke the contact but he has one night to do that and Fiona no longer remembers him, he have to make her realize about them.But still it is nowhere near to first two installment of the series. But movie has good parts and better moment than third."
104,Shrek Forever After,7,13 February 2011,A nice finish to the Shrek Movie collection.,"Unlike the fiasco of Shrek the Third, this one actually went back to its roots.The plot wasn't too bad either, as it was about an alternate universe of Shrek's world after he made an ill advised deal with Rumpelstiltskin. The ogre resistance army was a nice touch, as well as showing Fiona as an Ogre warrior.It didn't have the epic feeling of Shrek 2, but I did enjoy this one a lot more than its previous installment. The writers of this movie actually tried this time, which made me happy."
105,Shrek Forever After,,28 January 2011,recycling,"They had to take this tale a few steps back in order to make a 4th version of it. The first one sounded fresh in how it reused popular cosmologies borrowed from the sweet corner of children's oriented stories. The second one floated over that and played an interesting game of twisted self-reference(s). That was the best. The comedy was in the out references and how the filmmakers played with them. The form itself was funny, more than the jokes or the characters.Now this 4th version needs to make a story about how the romantic story involving the ogre and the princess has to happen again. So the story is literally reset to the very start, before Shrek knew Fiona, or the donkey, or before the cat was a recognizable character.I admit the device works to revive the freshness of the first film, after the disaster of the third one. If you play along and want to get nostalgic about that one, made 10 years ago, you can enter the game and have a few laughs. The cleverness of the device allows you to do that. But there's not much happening here, apart from that.The characters are as tired by now as poor Shrek at the beginning of the film when he punches the table.My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
106,Shrek Forever After,7,27 January 2011,Almost perfect way to end the Shrek series...,"Dreamworks style.Shrek 1 was perfect. Beyond a doubt. Funny, original, unique, emotion, and so on. The plot was perfect, the characters were awesome, the love and the humor tied in perfectly. A first (my opinion) for Dreamworks.Then came Shrek 2. Even better. It continued the story, and still had a ton of uniqueness as well as keeping the original feel of the idea. The humor was very well done, and the love was just as great. I dare say it almost was better than the first one! Shrek 3 comes and you can see Dreamworks trying a bit too hard to keep the series going. You can start to see the new characters introduced starting to loose their originality. The original characters don't improve too much, they just keep learning the same life lesson. The emotions start to lessen.Shrek 4 finally comes and attempts to end the series. This was in competition with Toy Story 3. To be honest, Toy Story wins the ""finish the series award"" but if I were to focus on just Dreamworks, then it's not to bad.The new characters, to me, come out of no where. They lack the originality, they still have humor but they don't really seem ""scary"". Puss in boots instantly becomes a classic to the story. But they start to loose the characters at that point. I mean, the main evil character in Shrek 4 isn't that much of an addition.But anyway, it was an okay way to end, it could have been better, but it could have been worse.Rated 7/10"
107,Shrek Forever After,6,22 January 2011,3D Review: I hope this is the final chapter,"**1/2 out of (****)Going into the 2001 family adventure extravaganza known as ""Shrek"", I was quite skeptical despite its rave critical reception. After coming out of the theater, I had such a blast and had even a greater time watching it on Blu-ray 3D. ""Shrek 2"" was three fourths as good as its predecessor, which was good enough. It still retained ""Shrek""'s charm, witty humor, and enjoyment factor. ""Shrek the third"", or should I say ""Shrek the turd"", was like a bullet to the chest. It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, and it was just uninteresting. The Good News: Forever After is a refresher over the third installment. The Bad News: It kind of stinks.First and foremost, the acting. Strangely, I did not care about any of the characters except Donkey. It seems like everyone was so angry all the time. They just weren't fun. At all. As for the script, I thought it was very uninspired. It was like a leftover script from ""Shrek 2"". Furthermore, the biggest flaw of this movie is that it's just not fun. The same problem its predecessor shared, ""Shrek the third"". There's just no charm, no fun. It's just a very average family adventure flick that just so happens to top its last installment. Anything good? Well... the 3D is solid. The depth is amazing, there's a sufficient amount of gimmicks, and overall it adds to the experience. Speaking of enhancing the experience, visually, this is the best Shrek movie. There's a plethora of color, especially at the end, and the atmosphere is just so rich. It doesn't even feel like a Shrek movie. And, I did like the message. There are some animated movies that are melodramatic (intentionally too), and lay on morals very thick and syrupy. This film isn't one of them.All in all, I really tried to like this movie... but I just didn't. While it's not a chore to sit through, I could've done something more productive. I just hope it's really the final chapter. While it's not a disgrace to the franchise, it's not a highlight either. It seems like these sequels get more uninteresting and less involving. Actually, I might think that my ""6"" rating is a little generous. This isn't a bad movie, it just could've been better given its potential."
108,Shrek Forever After,4,14 January 2011,Wow - was that a huge disappointment,"I so loved ""Shrek - the original"" and even scored it 10/10. The original had everything a movie needed to have, but I never anticipated that the last installment would be nothing more than a very weak battle between ogres and witches. Shrek Forever After doesn't have any good jokes or sense of humor in it, let alone a storyline, or script! I'm glad I only rented it from the video-store for $3 and didn't buy it! This makes me realize even more how I dislike cash-cow sequels. The worst thing of all they've already announced 2011 as the year of sequels and superhero movies. Jesus Christ - how low can we go. From a positive side, I do like the idea of alternative realities, as it matches with some of the multi-verse theories that go around in the world of physics, but putting those in Shrek? It all seems a bit too far from being a fun movie to me!"
109,Shrek Forever After,3,14 January 2011,No Coherent Plot,"This film lacks a major plot outline. The Shrek franchise is known for making brilliant comedy films, but this one lacked sparkle and magic and originality. The plot focused too much on the first film, and didn't focus enough making an original plot with comedy. It was a bore to watch and genuinely shouldn't be allowed to go ahead with a 5th.The film seems to focus on using the script and storyline of the first film and rewriting it slightly. It was a short, boring, badly acted, badly written and badly everything film. The only thing giving it a little magic was the experience of the people making it, as this was the 4th one. To improve- this film should focus on getting back to its roots and working out how to reconnect with the audience I am afraid, as a Shrek fan, I reluctantly give this a 3."
110,Shrek Forever After,8,8 January 2011,Part 4 and the beat goes on with more of the green guy,"But this time it starts off somewhat of a woman's lifetime episodicfor men. Boo Hoo poor Shrek can't go out and get into trouble anymore and rape and pillage the village like he did when he ran solo. Now, he has responsibilities, domestic responsibilitiesjust like us women have and he can't handle it. He wants to yell, kick, and scream, just like every little boy, or man, going through his mid-life crisis; and when he gets what he wished forthat 'man' freedomhe realizes that he blew the best thing he had going for him, his wife and kids. Of course, it's a fairy tale so he's able to snap his fingers and the world goes back to the way it's supposed to be. I think every man should be forced to watch Shrek 4, the melodrama or the treachery of a man's life when he can't go out hooting and hollering with the boys at night anymore, because, in the end, the jolly green giant realizes there is no place like home, and that's where he belongs. Seems like the first third was written by a man and the last two thirds by a woman. Yes, I liked the last two thirds better. When Shrek grovels to get back his woman and children."
111,Shrek Forever After,7,28 December 2010,I agree with those who say it's not as good as the first two but better than the third,"Released nine years after the first installment in the ""Shrek"" movie franchise, ""Shrek Forever After"" is the fourth and final installment. I've seen all the films in the franchise through the years, starting with the first one in late 2001, in the home video format. ""Shrek 2"" was the only one in the franchise which I saw in the theatre, and that was a memorable experience. In 2008, I revisited the first two films, having not seen either of them in several years, and thought they were still impressive, but then watched ""Shrek the Third"" for the first time, the year after its release, and found it to be mediocre, not unlike many other viewers. There was a good chance the fourth installment wouldn't be any better than the third, but now that I've seen it, over two years after I last watched any of the previous ""Shrek"" movies, I would say that it is.Shrek now lives in his swamp with Princess Fiona and their three ogre children, but he is now experiencing a midlife crisis. He is constantly getting unwanted attention, with nobody afraid of him anymore, and feels that he isn't much of an ogre anymore, missing the days when he could scare people away and have his privacy. The evil Rumpelstiltskin, whose plans to become king of Far Far Away were ruined when Shrek rescued Princess Fiona, tricks the ogre into taking his offer for him to live like an ogre again for one day in exchange for one day of his past erased. Shrek soon finds himself in an alternate world, where he is happy to find that he can scare everyone around him again. However, he then learns that in this world, Rumpelstiltskin is now the oppressive ruler of the kingdom, and ogres are used for slave labour! It turns out that the day the con artist erased was the day the ogre was born, so his whole existence has been reversed, and he will disappear tomorrow at sunrise! Shrek manages to escape from the castle with Donkey, and soon learns that the only way to save himself and return to where he was before he signed the contract is through true love's kiss, but he will have to do this before the next sunrise, so he doesn't have much time! The first part of this movie, showing Princess Fiona's parents almost signing the kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin before learning that their daughter has been rescued, is a memorable beginning, and shows that the animation in the ""Shrek"" franchise is still great. It's funny when Rumpelstiltskin angrily tears out pages of a book while narrating. There are some good laughs as we see Shrek's current living situation, though the ogre children's bodily functions may not always be that funny. The story looks very interesting around this point, and the entertainment continues as Shrek enters the alternate world, but may go downhill a little when the witches first appear. However, throughout the film, the plot is intriguing enough for the most part, a story in which Shrek realizes he didn't know how good he had it until it was too late, and the animation is still unsurprisingly amazing. Rumpelstiltskin, voiced here by Walt Dohrn, isn't the best antagonist, but he can be funny at times. The ogre's adventure is a fairly exciting one with some notably touching scenes. I also have to give ""Shrek Forever After"" credit for the times when it made me laugh (such as Shrek telling Donkey not to touch the waffles in the forest, but Donkey won't listen), even though the movie as a whole could have been much more consistent with the laughs.Since I watched this fourth and final installment in the franchise over two years after watching the third, and my memory of ""Shrek the Third"" isn't as clear as it could be, I can't explain everything that makes this one the stronger effort of the two, but two reasons might be the absence of the fairy tale princesses who were introduced in the 2007 film, and the fact that no characters in this final chapter are voiced by Justin Timberlake. There are obviously other reasons as well. While not all ""Shrek"" fans consider ""Shrek Forever After"" to be a very good way to end the franchise, I'm one of those who thinks it's not the best installment, but not the worst. In terms of quality, of the four movies, I would say this one comes in third, with its immediate predecessor in last place. Also, as a film starring Mike Myers made after ""The Love Guru"", it sure is better than that lousy 2008 comedy. I don't suggest you watch this fourth installment thinking the franchise ended as strongly as it began, but you could still find that it's decent family entertainment for fans of the very popular computer generated ogre."
112,Shrek Forever After,3,27 December 2010,Second rate Shrek,"A shame to see what was once so original, both in terms of graphic representation and slick but sharp comedic chops reduced to this really rather tawdry, hopefully ""final chapter"" as its US title would have it, in the Shrek franchise.It's only 90 minutes long but seems greatly padded out, with a plot that fatally and unoriginally owes more to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" crossed with ""Harry Potter"" than the toon world which inspired the original prototype.It's basically all plot and almost no laughs, only one line - Donkey's ""Time-share"" quip - broke my silence, nothing is added to our knowledge or empathy with the characters and you couldn't care less about the denouement. There's nothing new in the art department, ditto the use of soundtrack music, in fact the whole thing reeks of formula and cash-in.Time to retire the big guy and all his entourage. When the inevitable Christmas boxed set hits the shelves, this is the one you'll never play more than once."
113,Shrek Forever After,4,24 December 2010,Ogre and out,"Dreamworks have smartly ended this series before it continued its decline. The first two films were excellent and while these last two have still had a lot of charm and humour they have lacked that vital punch that separates a good family film from being a great family film.This film may be a slight improvement on the last one but there are still a lot of weaker jokes and already dated pop culture references that miss the mark. All the beloved characters return but by now the format is looking slightly tired. It is a nice final chapter for the fans but it feels right that this is Shreks last outing. Overall the Shrek saga has been an enjoyable one with lots of nice lines and characters. You could quite happily buy the whole box-set and find good moments in all four films, the problem is that these moments got a little far and few between in the last two films."
114,Shrek Forever After,8,16 December 2010,"Though not the best, ""Shrek Forever After"" is a good wrap-up for the series","I didn't see this in theaters, fearing that it would be lame like ""Shrek the Third"". Learning that my cousins had rented ""Shrek Forever After"", I thought why not kill an hour and a half. To my utter surprise, I found myself laughing on almost all levels as in the first two Shreks. The Disney spoofs, sense of ridiculous (such as bringing back the gags of exploding birds and frogs being blown up as balloons), and a good villain is all present.The cast is there, delivering witty lines at their brilliant best. Will Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin tops all of them. I've never heard of the actor but he should definitely consider doing more work in voice talent. His inflection brings life to the petite, annoying, and menacing Rumpelstiltskin. In short, the voice fits him perfect, like John Lithgow as Lord Farquaad in the first Shrek.The animation is brilliant in all aspects, ranging from the intense action sequences to the emotions that the characters display through their facial expressions. Well done. And once again, the humor is there and clever. But what this Shrek lacks is a witty plot. It falls into a ripoff of ""It's a Wonderful Life."" If I could live without my family in existence, what could possibly go wrong? Only trouble. We've all heard the same mumble jumble. The ending does lead to one dark direction, but it pulls off a surprise happy ending. It makes sense for this, I mean, it's Shrek. He has to win.In short, though not the best, ""Shrek Forever After"" is a good wrap-up for the series. Let's hope this is the last Shrek.My rating: 3 out of 4"
115,Shrek Forever After,4,10 December 2010,"Final ""Shrek"" chapter is comforting but superfluous","No matter which way you shake it, ""Shrek Forever After"" amounts to nothing more than a way to capitalize on a profitable franchise for a fourth time. Many fans will see this as proper closure to the franchise, but that's the closure *they* need, not that the films needed. ""Forever After"" feels much more like a side venture than a full-circle exclamation point for the 21st Century's most beloved animated character.This grand finale follows the classic ""see what your life would be like if nothing ever happened"" plot of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Shrek (Mike Myers) is a daddy ogre now whose life has become repetitive and devoid of personal free time. When he finally bursts, a crafty Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), the notorious deal-maker of fairy tale lore, strikes up a contract that in exchange for one day of Shrek's life, Shrek can have a day of being a regular ogre again. Shrek signs and suddenly ""Far, Far Away"" is turned upside down and Rumpelstiltskin has become the ruler.The ""don't know what you've got 'til it's gone"" theme gets exhausted early because we've seen this several times before. We realize that although Shrek enjoys part of his ""free day,"" he's going to regret his decision and want his old life back and plead with his friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to remember. The only plus to this story line is that it changes up these characters we know and love just enough to make the fresh again in our minds. Fat kitty Puss in Boots, for one, is quite entertaining. Yet the film never shakes us of the feeling that all this is happening just for the sake of having another ""Shrek"" adventure.Of all the new additions, necessary or not, Rumpelstiltskin is by far the best. Voice actor/writer Walt Dohrn shines in this elevated spotlight. He strikes up the right blend between bad guy we can pity and wacko villain and he's animated in a way that follows suit. Unfortunately, his character mutates from crafty magical underling to eccentric Napoleonic dictator once Shrek signs the contract and he becomes like most other animated despots.The other characters are up to the same tricks that DreamWorks Animation knows worked before and that we're apt to fall for again. Most everyone has at least one funny moment here or there, but ""Shrek Forever After"" is much less hysterical on the whole than previous installments.More significantly absent, however, is the sense of adventure and camaraderie. Previous films took us on actual journeys with these characters and showed us the ups and downs along the way, especially between Donkey and Shrek. In this film, Shrek attempts to make good with all his friends even though they don't know who he is. He's very much on his own and we don't feel all that bad for him because we all knew signing the contract was a bad idea. Certainly this lesson should be heard by children, but adults have learned it already and ""Forever After"" doesn't put a new spin on it.There's no shame in revisiting old friends in the form of familiar and lovable characters, but ""Shrek Forever After"" offers little more than those comforts. A handful of good jokes hit and some things surprise such as Rumpelstiltskin, but if this truly is the end of Shrek, I don't think any of us, fans or not, will have trouble living happily ever after.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
116,Shrek Forever After,6,6 December 2010,A good way to end the series,"Recap: Life couldn't be happier in the swamp as Shrek and Fiona plan the first birthday of their little kids. Or could it? Shrek is missing the good ole days when he wasn't a celebrity, his home wasn't a tourist attraction and his life weren't just chaos. One night he meets Rumpelstiltskin, a tricky little man crafty in magic deal. Shrek signs a deal that he can go back for one day, but of course Rumpelstiltskin has made his own terms. Shrek comes to a reality were Rumpelstiltskin is king and Fiona is the resistance leader of all the repressed ogres. To save them all Shrek must once again woo Fiona.Comments: The fourth installment of the Shrek series, and now it seems the series have come to an end. Or so I hope. Shrek Forever After is still a good movie, still funny, but the concept seem to be a little watered down now. This story stands more on its own legs, an adventure in its own rights. But it doesn't have all the more or less hidden references and homages to different fairy tales and more modern movies, stuff that elevated the previous movies from very good to stellar. So this seems like the time to end the series, while things are still good.Because this is a good movie, it is funny, but is more prominently a movie for the kids than the previous were, which everybody could enjoy. I still enjoyed it, but it wasn't as hilarious as the others, and simply didn't meet the high expectations. The only that seemed to get better, and the best in this movie, was Donkey and Murphy's portrayal of him. Added to that was quite a lot good jokes or just fun situations, but nothing really spectacular. So it's time to put the ogres to sleep for good this time (before anybody does something we all will regret) 6/10"
117,Shrek Forever After,6,30 November 2010,Shrek the Last?,"The first two Shrek movies were not as brilliant as most critics said and this fourth installment (after the weak third part) is not quite as bad as they say.Yes, there's a certain slackness to all the calculated proceedings, but the basic premise is quite intriguing, though hardly original. At least, the pic moves reasonably well, some jokes are great and despite a rather lame showdown, which is a weakness of all the Shrek movies, the story (with its dark undercurrents of existential crises) is told effectively, with Rumpelstiltskin being a first-class villain.The many, many pop songs on the soundtrack grow tiresome after a short while.6 out of 10 hissing geese"
118,Shrek Forever After,7,28 November 2010,Shrek 4everafter is way way funnier than the Shrek 3:the Third.,"SHREK 4EVER AFTER  CATCH IT (B+) Shrek 4everafter is way way funnier than the Shrek 3:the Third. I think a perfect ending to the franchise. This time we get to see another side of our beloved characters which was really fun. I think the most humor is provided by the Donkey & Puss in the boots. Heads Off to Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas who brought a incredible and much needed humor which was totally missing from the Shrek 3. John Meyers and Cameron Diaz did fantastic job as always with their vocal talents. The graphics & colors of the movie was simply mind blowing. I think the world Shrek went into Shrek 4 was as entertaining as the world we introduced to it in Shrek 1. Everyone should watch it, highly entertaining and hilarious."
119,Shrek Forever After,7,28 November 2010,"A funny fairy-comedy, but not very Shrekish","The essence of Shrek movies was parody of fairy-tales and the Hollywood world alike, making it a fun and ironic comedy for all ages. Instead, the fourth chapter of the Shrek story was a simple hero-saves-all tale, with all the references going back to previous Shrek films. All in all, a funny what-if remembrance of the whole franchise, but more than anything else, pretty obvious.That doesn't mean Eddie Murphy wasn't a perfect ass, that Antonio Banderas wasn't hilarious as a fat spoiled cat and that Myke Myers wasn't the same hopeless romantic ogre he portrayed in the first three films, but the comedy was situational at best, the story linear and the characters rather plain. I mean, Dragon acted as a dragon, the pigs ate everything, even in the ""good"" universe and the witches behaved as perfect German soldiers in American movies about World War 2.Bottom line: fun as a stand-alone movie, but a but of a disappointment as a Shrek film."
120,Shrek Forever After,7,23 October 2010,Wish-fulfillment,"After the very disappointing 3rd Shrek it only could get better now couldn't it? Maybe there was a slight chance it would continue downhill, but fortunately they actually did manage to come up with a good story. A story one can only hope that puts the Shrek Saga to rest. What else should there come after this? It's OK to do a spin-off with Antonio Banderas character, but please not another Shrek (because I very much fear it would be along the lines of the very bad Shrek 3).So while they didn't invent anything new (or did they?), the basic idea to make it about Shrek finding himself was strong enough to fill the movie. Not that many subplots and almost no distraction help the movie significantly! Not Pixar territory, but a good movie nevertheless."
121,Shrek Forever After,7,14 October 2010,Not the best Shrek film but a fine closure for the series,"Since 2001, Shrek has touched our hearts with humor and charm and has become a major icon in the animation industry. The first two Shrek films were great fun delivering amusing fairy tale satire and memorable characters. Shrek the Third however, never got my attention and I herd it was pretty bad so I decided to skip it.Now we have Shrek Forever After (aka, The Final Chapter), the four and final film in the series. I didn't get interested in this one either. But when I saw that this movie was playing on a Qantas flight I was on to Sydney, I decided to give it a chance.The plot in the final installment is fairly interesting. Shrek has grown tired of being a father and a celebrity and wishes to live the days of an ogre again. He is later scammed into a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to become ""ogre for a day"" and finds himself in twisted version of Far Far Away where Rumpelstiltskin is King and Shrek is known to nobody (not even Fiona who is now an hunting ogre). Shrek must stop Rumpelstiltskin's evil deed before it's too late. It's a decent presentation.DreamWorks gives out plenty of action in this entry (which the second one lacked) and this does bring the memories of the first film. Speaking of previous films, Forever After has a good number of connections with past events in the series. There aren't as many laughs as there were in the previous films, but it does deliver it's funny bits quite well such as break dancing witches.Visuals are a big treat in this installment as they have improved a lot over the years. They're fantastic. All the main cast are back and they deliver a reasonable performance for their characters. Walt Dohrn however, does a great job providing the voice for the antagonist Rumpelstiltskin showing a great expression of wit and evilness.Overall, it's a fun entry for the series. But is The Final Chapter the best of the four Shrek films? Not exactly, but it doesn't have to be. Shrek 4 may not have the magic from the first two films but what it does do is improve over it's poor predecessor and end the once doomed series with charm and dignity. ""B"""
122,Shrek Forever After,6,26 July 2010,Shrek Forever After,"Shrek Forever After (also known as Shrek: The Final Chapter) is the fourth and final film in the Shrek series that began in 2001. The film stars Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas. The film has been a box office success, taking in nearly $600 million just two months after release.Shrek Forever After follows the events of Shrek The Third. Shrek, now a hard working father and husband, longs for the days where people fled from him in fear, but now has to live with people asking him to sign their pitchforks or emit his famous roar. He strikes a deal with the sneaky Rumplestiltskin which results in him entering a world where he was never born. As a result, Rumple is now the king of Far Far Away and none of Shreks friends know him. He must reverse the evil curse before the day runs out, which will result in him being erased from existence forever.As with most Dreamworks films, Shrek Forever After boasts fluid, detailed CGI animation. It still does not look as vibrant or charming as a Pixar film, but the detail packed into the scenery and characters makes this a beautiful looking film. The 3D is a waste of money in my eyes. I payed £17 for two 3D tickets and all it did was subtract from the colour of the film, and it was not put to good use. It just gave the film some unnecessary depth, which did nothing to enhance the experience. I don't want films to be made exclusively with 3D in mind, but if you're not going to put it to good use, then don't con people into buying tickets for it. So be warned viewers: buy a regular ticket for a cheaper price and watch the movie more vibrantly without those daft glasses.My main criticism with this film is how it does nothing to build upon the Shrek storyline. Shrek The Third could have been a better film in my eyes, but it completed the story. Shrek had married his true love, the kingdom of Far Far Away had been restored, and Shrek lived happily ever after. Shrek Forever After continues the story in an unnecessary fashion. Calling it The Final Chapter made me expect an epic conclusion to the story. Instead, the film feels more like a spin off, and does not conclude the franchise. I'm glad the plans for Shrek 5 were scrapped, because this is where this dying series had to end. I also felt this film wasn't well structured. The growing love between Shrek and the now war hungry Fiona felt rushed and unrealistic, and the film kept fluctuating between emotion and humour. It seems Dreamworks cannot master animation like Pixar can. They have to resort to unnecessary comedy a lot of the time, and it's annoying.The voice acting was good. Eddie Murphy did a funny performance as Donkey and the rest of the actors also did well. The voice for Rumplestiltskin, Walt Dohrn, did a fabulous job at an evil yet comedic villain voice, and it was awesome.Overall, Shrek Forever After is a good film worth seeing if you like the Shrek series. It does nothing to the series and feels more like a spin off but on it's own it's a reasonably entertaining comedy. Just don't expect it to be as a good as the first two films, which I loved. Also, save your money and watch it in 2D. The 3D is there to con you into spending more money to watch a less colourful, layered film. I give this film a 6/10."
123,Shrek Forever After,6,24 June 2010,So-so movie,"This franchise is I think maybe the most popular animated franchise after Toy Story . I think that it is really magic and entertaining franchise . I am not big lover of Shrek but thus movie always entertains me a lot . This is real animated fairytale . When I saw trailer first time I didn't even think about watching this movie . Then I decided that I should watch this sequel . I watched previous movies so why won't watch this movie ? That was my question about watching this movie . 3D as worldwide popular technique was pretty good . As movie started it seemed that it will be just as other parts but it was really special . I think this was the funniest part and most revolutionary part but it hasn't some magic like all movies . I have to say that it is much more better than boring third part . It was funny and I like that everything was greatly connected . Whole team was here . Shrek was again in center but it wasn't something like previous performances . It was pretty desperate . Fiona was finally great but it wasn't like other animated characters from this movies . Donkey again in really funny performance but Puss in Boots was unbeatable . He was so funny and he was in one new ""image"" . That was the best part of the movie . Cookie wasn't so much in this movie and that was big minus . New character Rumpelstiltskin was so-so . Just as whole this movie . It wasn't like other parts of franchise but it was really entertaining ."
124,Shrek Forever After,4,18 June 2010,Not bad definitely better then the third one!,"i liked it a lot better then the third instalment of this series thats for sure, however even though i have heard that there is no need to worry about a fourth chapter to this because the creators etc, are done. This chapter had at least a mildly entertaining storyline that has Shrek at a crossroads in his life...married children wife,donkey and the rest of his clan however he dwells on the fact of the days when he lived alone in his swamp and frightened everyone. After a breakdown he ventures off on a stroll to cool down accidentally bumping into Rumpelstiltskin on the way, Rumpelstiltskin befriends him and offers him a way to go an be a scary ogre all he has to do is give him a day of his life he cant remember. What ends up happening is he gets thrown back in time having to get Fiona to fall in love with him all over. Can he win everyone back ??? Moral of the story is be careful what you wish for..you just might get it. We didn't have the chance to see this in 3d format however it was enjoyable all the same. All these chapters of the Shrek story are missing one huge element that the first instalment contained... comedy."
125,Shrek Forever After,6,18 June 2010,"Well, it's better than part 3.","SHREK FOREVER AFTER or SHREK THE FINAL CHAPTER (or whatever you want to call it) is better than SHREK THE THIRD but that's not saying much.Seems Shrek is sick of the new life that he has and wants to go back to his old life where people are still afraid of Ogres and he doesn't have to deal with the baggage that comes with being a parent. Hey, if that is the case, you should of wrapped your Ogre dong up with an Ogre condom and your problem should have been solved.Anyway, Shrek makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin (an annoying voice if I ever did hear one) and suddenly Shrek is swept back to a day when people ARE still afraid of Ogres and he doesn't have the responsibilities of dealing with his offspring. Plus, he no longer has Fiona has his devoted wife. I say devoted cause she made the choice to stay an ugly Ogre instead of the beautiful Princess that she ""sorta"" was cause she knew that she loved Shrek and that she would pretty much do anything for him. That shows devotion. For Shrek to make a deal with Rumple-dumbass so that he could live his old, so called ""normal"" life for one day again just shows ignorance on his part.So, like I have to say it, Shrek realizes that he wants the life back that he had with his wife and his kids and his old friend Donkey and all those other asses. Only thing is, in order for Shrek to get the life back that he had, he must break the deal he had with Rumple-foreskin by kissing Fiona cause in the fine print clause on the deal he made with you-figure-it-out it says something about ""True Loves Kiss' or something along those lines. It's only ""true love"" if Fiona actually loves him. Of course other things happen along the way and of course Fiona does love him by the end of the movie. I don't necessarily consider that a spoiler cause if your reading this and you couldn't figure that out than, well, your an idiot. lol.Anyway, once again, this movie is better than the 3rd one but, like I said, that's not saying much. I really do hope Dreamworks ends the Shrek franchise with this movie. I guess we'll have to wait and see."
126,Shrek Forever After,5,17 June 2010,Shrek and co feel stale today.,"This fourth instalment tries hard to bring something fresh to the franchise, however Shrek and co just feel stale today, nine years on from their glorious introduction. Donkey has gone from causing belly laughs and sprouting quotable one-liners to being annoying and repetitive; not overly great for the character which has always been the true drawcard for the series. Though it is the big green man himself who has become the most tiresome; his constant whinging and heavy Scottish accent the source for serious boredom. Especially since this sequel has amped up the seriousness and soppiness, majority of which comes from Shrek. There are a few supporting players which snare a laugh here and there, Puss-in-Boots and Butter Pants  a manly looking child with a memorable voice  being two worth mentioning.Fortunately the in-charge Mitchell has a solid handle on the action sequences. There are a number of set pieces  Shrek and Fiona's climactic escape from Rumpelstiltskin's clutches is a highlight  that are exciting and enjoyable, but they act like a double-edged sword and also serve to emphasize how dull the slower, talkative scenes really are. If only the cast and crew could inject the familiar characters and run-of-the-mill story with the same amount of energy and enthusiasm, perhaps Shrek Forever After could have been a more fitting closure.The one (and only) thing improved upon since the first movie  the animation  is delightful to look at mind you. The picture is crystal-clear and the third dimension has been utilised properly. There are a handful of instances where the 'coming-at-you' gimmickry rears its ugly head, which the kiddies don't seem to mind, however for the most part Mitchell grasps the true effectiveness of 3D quite well and adds depth to the visuals which in turn allows his on screen universe to expand.Dreamworks has said for a long time that this will be Shrek's last adventure, if this is the best they can come up with for the famous ogre and his friends then let's hope they stick to their guns.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
127,Shrek Forever After,9,19 May 2010,this movie is so far far away from being as bad as the third,"i saw shrek forever after at a private screening in my hometown and i was so happy to see some of that more mature humor that is in the first 2 movies, shrek the third was your normal bull,boring,kid flick.the 3d was amazing the story was OK but a lot of TV shows and other movies have use the make a wish and regret it later plot.for people who are mike myers fans you will love this movie he has a very good talent for voice over work you can tell he enjoys it now for Cameron diaz i don't know in the first shrek she played her part wonderfully in this one it seems she rushes her lines and she fakes her emotions i know she is a acter and that's her job but she is much more believable in the first shrek.now what can i say about Eddie Murphy he is the best person,actor,comedian,to play the role as donkey, donkey's character is fast talking, cocky, witty, funny, and at times serious just like Eddie Murphy .and last but not least puss in boots played by Antonio banderas in my opinion puss stills some of the spotlight from donkey witch is perfect because they incorporate that into the movie with donkey and puss always arguing and competing for attention from shrek.in short if you are into fairy tales, love stories,adventure,and having a good time than i would recommend go see this movie whether in 2d or 3d this is a wonderful movie."
128,Shrek Forever After,7,20 May 2010,Waaay better than the third Shrek...,"To be honest, I was expecting to watch something that would make me laugh like I did in the first two parts of shrek hoping that dream works learned from their mistake after the epic failure of the third installment, but it still didn't reach their level of awesomeness, but you can say that shrek did it again....Partially.In general, the movie is cool, it's funny and entertaining, it has its hilarious moments and the story is pretty much satisfying, Way better than the third shrek if that's what you want to hear.So in the end, I recommend you just go and watch it with your popcorn and drinks and prepare to enjoy it enough but expect that much."
129,Shrek Forever After,8,23 May 2010,A Surprisingly Dark Finale for the Franchise,"Shrek is feeling over-domesticated in the fourth installment. He has lost his roar. It used to send villagers running away in terror. Now they run to him and ask him to sign their pitchforks and torches. To regain his ogre mojo, he strikes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin. The pact goes awry and Shrek must confront what life would be like in Far Far Away if he had never existed. That translates into Donkey being forced into cart-pulling duty, fat and lazy Puss in Boots trading his sword for a pink bow and the underhanded Rumpelstiltskin ruling the kingdom.It's official: Dreamworks has crap marketing when promoting their movies. As some of you might have noticed, the marketing for the final chapter of Shrek seemed lukewarm and tepid, to say the least. Fortunately, the film is anything but that. In fact, I have to say that SHREK 4 is a surprisingly dark finale for the franchise. SHREK 4 plays out like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Shrek being the protagonist. The main reason this film succeeds is because there is a strong story to be told, unlike part 3. The story plays out as straightforward as it could be, which works really well. There are no twists and turns and unnecessary subplots. This way, we feel more connected with Shrek and his goal.The heart, which was lacking in the last film, is back in here, which is more of a welcome. There are a lot of depressing and serious moments in here as well as some very moving scenes that will make some people cry. However, all is not somber. There are plenty of hilarious moments in here too, most of which are coming from Donkey and Puss in Boots, as well as some new ogre characters. Other new characters include Rumpelstiltskin, a fantastic and devilish villain, and the ingenious use of Pied Piper.I would also like to point out the fantastic soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams. He incorporates the previous themes in the series and made them much more personal and heartfelt than ever before. The use of the 3D is also put to good use, rather than have things pop out for every five minutes. Maybe the only complaint I had is that the climax battle is a bit weak, much like IRON MAN 2. While not as great as the first two, I much prefer this film to be the ending to the series than the disappointing third film. With a strong story, great characters, and a good moral, SHREK 4 may as well be the first great film of the summer."
130,Shrek Forever After,8,31 May 2010,Best Shrek yet,"This is the best ""Shrek"" movie since the first one and is easily the funniest of the lot. This time around the plot revolves around Shrek developing a mid-life crisis and making a deal with the devious Rumpelstiltskin (the villain of the piece) to have one day of his single life back, he gets his wish but loses the day he was born in exchange. The rest of the movie follows how Shrek tries to get everything back to the way it used to be.All the ingredients that have made this franchise so popular are retained- particularly the clever pop culture references and the sharp interplay between all the main characters. The soundtrack is also very well-chosen and some of the selections are used to hilarious effect. All in all this is a very funny film from beginning to end and a top choice if you are looking for a lighthearted night out. Highly recommended."
131,Shrek Forever After,7,21 May 2010,A More Mature Shrek - A Worthy Last Installment,"Our favorite ogre Shrek is back for its final installment, and this was presented in 3D. 3D is getting to be norm nowadays, it seemed already ordinary. There are only few scenes in this movie that the 3D actually inspired awe. Maybe watching in 2D would be enough, in retrospect.In Shrek Forever After, Shrek is getting bored with his routine family life and misses his terrorizing ogre days terribly. After his emotional breakdown during his triplet's birthday party, Shrek signs a deal with the devious and cunning Rumpelstiltskin to experience to become real ogre again for a day. However, in return, the contract makes Shrek lose more than he bargained for -- everyone he loves. To break the spell, Shrek to make Fiona fall in love with him all over again.The theme is definitely more mature. The scenes where Shrek was trying to reconnect with the warrior Fiona were actually heartwarming and charming. The lines towards the end about love and family were very nice and touching. Shrek's very last words were a most meaningful parting message to the dads and moms in the audience.Donkey and Puss were there to provide effective comic relief, as always. I did not really like the look of the main villain, Rumpelstiltskin, so that detracted from my total enjoyment. I thought their interpretation of the Pied Piper, however, was quite smart.I thought the Shrek franchise went the wrong direction with its insipid third movie. The first two were really animation classics in terms of comedy and action. This fourth one fortunately went back on track in the correct path. While not in the same caliber as the first two, this was certainly a very good last episode of the franchise."
132,Shrek Forever After,6,23 May 2010,"Lost its magic, but it will keep you entertained.","Shrek 4 might be the most heartwarming of all the Shrek films but the jokes were lessen, they add more dramas and love story. It's still good but not as great as the first and the second. The previous ones were masterpieces. Shrek 4 is not original unlike the first. I must say that it was more mature than the others but is that what you're really looking for in Shrek movies? I came to see some pretty good jokes. In addtion, some of the jokes were pretty similar to the previous ones. Its conflict was pretty boring unlike the smashing conflict of the 2nd. But it is absolutely better than the third but only because its story makes much more sense. Of course it isn't the worst movie ever, and not the worst Shrek films. Should you watch this in the theaters? My advice is wait for it to come out on DVD. You will not waste your time watching this, but you won't have a blast either."
133,Shrek Forever After,4,30 May 2010,"Dull, bland and forgettable, but not as bad as Shrek The Third","Shrek 1 & 2 were both masterpieces in their own right, and Shrek The Third was awful. Shrek Forever After is mediocre but now this series must come to an end. The new car smell of the series has worn off, and it just feels like they're doing the same thing over and over and over again. This is just disposable family entertainment meant for parents to spend $10 to take their children to it, and this movie is alright enough so that if the kids like it, the parents won't mind. All the old voices (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz) return, along with new voices like Jane Lynch, Craig Robinson, Kathy Griffin, Kristen Schaal, Mary Kay Place, and scene stealing Walt Bohrn as Rumpelstiltskin, the mean, cynical man who cons Shrek into never being born. This is basically an animated, ogre-filled version of It's A Wonderful Life. That might of been a good idea if the execution were actually good, but it's dull, bland, and forgettable. The Pied Piper comes in as a character playing a bounty hunter role, and he's awesome, but the good outweighs the bad and unless you have kids begging you to see Shrek Forever After, then you'd be better off just skipping it."
134,Shrek Forever After,6,5 September 2010,'Shrek Forever After' is a glass half-empty,"In the 3-D (and stereoscopic) animated film, Shrek Forever After, Shrek, the green ogre, has become bored with the domesticated life of raising children with his wife, Princess Fiona, along with the fact that no one treats him with any fear or respect. One day, Shrek feels he has had it and makes a pact with Rumplestiltskin, a deal-making magician of sorts, to feel like a real ogre for a day. When he finds out he's been duped and sent to a twisted version of Far Far Away, where Rumplestiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and Fiona doesn't know him, he sets to get his life back and reclaim his true love.This one is the fourth installment of the Shrek series. I haven't seen the third one, as I had heard many horrible things about it. I have seen the first two, which I've enjoyed immensely. First film offered a clever, humorous twist on fairy tales. Second goes farther with the twists by adding pop-culture references re-imagined in context of the fairy tales. Both were very inventive and full of energy and details. This version, unfortunately, feels like all of that has been reduced by half. In general fun and humor, it's straight-to-DVD quality, although you can't get the stereoscopic view. The jokes aren't as funny as it used to be. The details and environments also feel somewhat desolate this time around. The subtleties are gone.The stereoscopic 3-D aspect of the film feels like it's been tacked in there. The flying scenes inside the castle are kind of neat, but during most of the film, I didn't even notice that it was in 3-D. Don't expect anything as grand or beautiful or clever as How To Train Your Dragon.I suppose by the fourth film, it is inevitable that much of the joy of the first and second film will have been drained out. I assume the storytellers are running out of ideas when sequels revert to a time-travel idea (I'm reminded of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Turtles in Time) or a ""reboot"" of sorts. Yes, it's essentially a reboot because much of the film is an alternate timeline, and Shrek has to meet his friends all over again who don't recognize him. It's kind of like getting re-acquainted with Arnold Schwartzenegger's T-100 in Terminator 3. It also doesn't help that the plot concept has been done before, such as in It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Destiny. The plot progression is essentially by-the-numbers, and so is a good chunk of the humor. It never feels quite organic. There is more slapstick than jokes. Sadly, in my theater, I couldn't hear any kids laughing at any of the jokes, which wasn't a good sign.However, there are some good moments in the film. Despite the overused plot, Shrek is still a likable character. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is still around. Conrad Vernon's Rumplestiltskin is a mean yet somewhat dark character, reminding me of John Lithgow's Lord Farquaadalmost. The Pied Piper as a baddie is an ingenious ideahow I wished the film centered more on this guy! A scene involving Rumplestiltskin's ""half-full"" glass of water is also excellent. I even liked the fact that Shrek goes through something like a midlife crisis. I only wished it was handled in a way that wasn't so familiar.Overall, it's not a bad film. It's just doesn't live up to the potential set by the previous films I saw. If there was no Shrek 1 and 2, it may've been considered a pretty decent film--of course, it also means there shouldn't be other good 3-D animations to compete with. Nevertheless, friends have told me this installment is still miles better than the third one. I guess I won't be seeing the third one for sure. I give Shrek Forever After ** out of **** stars.You can also follow my more recent reviews on twitter.com/d_art"
135,Shrek Forever After,6,20 July 2010,It's... another Shrek movie.,"I wouldn't say this was a bad movie. That would be a lie. I did enjoy this movie.The major problem with this movie was that it just was another Shrek movie. Similar plot line, same jokes as the other ones, same resolution.As a movie, it was alright, but it failed to stand out as anything. It didn't do anything to make it stand out from the rest of Shrek movies, or in movies at all. It was ""Just another Shrek Movie."" That is how I felt about it. It was an interesting concept, adding to Shrek's life story, but by the end of the movie, I thought to myself ""Well, at least I didn't pay to see this.""So, I would say it's worth a watch, but don't expect anything exceptional."
136,Shrek Forever After,5,3 July 2010,Depressing end to a creative series,"It's unfortunate that the Shrek series ends here. Not because it should continue, but because this film could've benefited from another year in script development and actually done the saga justice. Attempting to deconstruct the daily reality of a life lived 'Happily Ever After', this final chapter goes into some really depressing territory that is anything but kids' stuff and where the laughs are scant at best.Shrek, finding himself domesticated and beloved by people, grows weary of the day-to-day monotony and wishes for the salad days of a pre-Fiona life. Enter Rumpelstiltskin, voiced by GENUINE VOICE ACTOR Walt Dohrn who, as the Machiavellian imp, is perhaps the ONLY shining light in the film. Shrek makes a deal with him to have a day where he was once again feared and free of responsibility, and gives him a childhood day in exchange as payment. Rumple takes the day of his birth, sending Shrek into a skewed reality in which he was never born (ála 'It's a Wonderful Life') and where Fiona leads a band of ogres against the tyranny of Rumpelstiltskin's rule over Far Far Away.The film's bleak tone is made worse by its dark colour palate (since most of it occurs that night), seedy atmosphere (e.g. a 'cock' fight between the Gingerbread Man and a pack of animal crackers), and skewed characters  beloved characters  that just aren't themselves. Without the laughter or the love, 'Shrek Forever After' leaves half the family out of the equation. My kids were utterly bored, and sad to say, I don't blame them."
137,Shrek Forever After,4,9 June 2010,Please be the last one,"The Shrek series is ending at least two movies too late. The first two were plenty of fun, but the third one was merely okay and this final one is just tepid, sleepwalking through its own milieu with a script that seems to have had all the jokes removed.As movie series progress, the makers must come up with new situations for their protagonists to experience. So here, Shrek makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin that alters the timelines of him and everyone else in Far, Far Away: he gets one day in which to live as a regular old ogre, just like before he met Fiona and Donkey; in return, Rumplestiltskin gets one of Shrek's days for himself. Turns out he chooses the day the big green fella was born, which (obviously) means a new timeline in which he never saved Fiona from the castle (among other things).It's almost a crutch, having a main character live his life in an alternate timeline, because that way you can have that main character re-meet all his friends. It's like getting a second origin story. And sure enough, we meet several of the characters from the earlier films, such as Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, and the Three Little Pigs, not to mention Donkey's red-dragon wife. And naturally, because everyone in this timeline is used to a world in which Rumplestiltskin is large and in charge, Shrek needs to do a little convincing. Not the least of which is to Fiona herself, because  as the ironclad contract with Rumple notes  only true love's kiss can break the deal.The thing I liked most about the first couple of Shrek movies was the unending patter of jokes. Lots of pop-culture references (anachronistically), many of which worked. Lots of gross-out gags, too. And great chemistry between characters, even though they'd just met. It all sort of clicked then, but none of that is apparent in this fourth installment. The humor is, at best, scattershot  and not in the Airplane! style, either, where characters make seemingly hundreds of jokes a minute, with some working and some not. It almost feels as if there were a joke quota here, only it's a maximum of two per reel.Shrek 4 is charmless, too. I know we're supposed to root for Shrek (and the ending isn't unsatisfying), but his adventures trying to get his true love's kiss are sometimes tedious and uninspired. The problem here is that Shrek the character is supposed to be a grouchy bastard, but he's typically offset by the wild extrovertism of Donkey and the sweetness of Fiona. And since this alternate timeline indicates that neither has met Shrek, neither gets to balance out his irascible behavior.There were plenty of little tykes in the theater this morning, and I didn't really hear a lot of oohs and ahhs or laughs. It could be that Shrek Forever After failed to be broad enough in its humor and yet too intense in its action to appeal to its core audience. The series can finally rest."
138,Shrek Forever After,5,10 June 2010,No Better Than OK,"I'm not in particular an aficionado of the Shrek series. I saw the first one and enjoyed it, but haven't actually seen 2 or 3. My daughter, though, loves Shrek, and so we went to see the fourth and final instalment tonight. Although the first movie was enjoyable enough, I was frankly tired enough of the lovable ogre when it was over that I didn't want to watch him again, and by now apparently Shrek feels that way too! In this movie, he's tired of the whole lovable ogre image and wants to return to the times when he was feared as an ogre, and he works out a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to allow him to do just that, but he hadn't considered that with his brand new life came the loss of his old life - including his family and friends. Fiona no longer knows him and, of course, their children don't exist. Not even Donkey knows who he is, and the world is a pretty bleak place in this new life. Rumpelstiltskin has taken over Far Far Away from Fiona's parents and all the ogres are imprisoned. In this sense, the movie has a bit of similarity to ""It's A Wonderful Life."" Obviously, the point of the movie is to put things right.This was no better than OK. Not having seen Parts 2 and 3, I can't really compare them, but it's certainly less fun than the first movie. My daughter - the Shrek fan - enjoyed it, but also found some parts quite scary, and it is a rather heavy movie at times. There's a revolving door of fairy tale characters, of course - Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, the Ginger Bread Man, Puss In Boots, etc. I suppose the message was good - learn to appreciate the life you have, because the alternative might not be that pleasing. As a farewell to the series (as I understand it there are no more Shrek movies planned) I didn't really see any particular closure involved with this - it didn't seem like a good way to say good-bye to the characters. Surely that was a serious missed opportunity."
139,Shrek Forever After,6,29 May 2010,Not a step up,"Well it wasn't bad and I got a kick out of this one than Shrek The Third and was funnier and I just grown to love these characters and the place they call home. It's not the classic like the first two especially the second one and it just wasn't all that memorable. This story has been done to death now and is no longer fresh anymore and sometimes it came off ass generic and the 3D aspect didn't do much for me just took more of my money and it just didn't have much heart and spunk this time. I will have to say that the star of this animated feature will have to go to Rumpelstiltskin because he stole every scene and brought some kind of life to it but everything else seemed rushed, forced but it still had a good soundtrack again. For having final chapter in its title it doesn't seem like their story is complete and the ending felt very anti climatic so I have a feeling that this isn't the last time we will see these characters on the big screen. Overall it's a good film to take the whole family to but anyone hoping to see a sequel that is just as good as the first two shreks look elsewhere. Wait for DVD. More of a 2.5 out of 5 stars."
140,Shrek Forever After,8,25 May 2010,Pleasant family movie,"A highly anticipated movie of the year, and it matches up to that anticipation. The movie as always has gripping characters and puss and donkey never fail. however the movie is really really short according to me and can be divided only into a few specific scenes. These scenes are beautifully crafted and even as the fourth part of this SHREK enterprise it does not disappoint as it is not a drag. Puss in his gigantic new avatar proves that he does not have be the normal jumping jack he is, and donkey for the first time after the first shrek shows that he does have an individual role to play. the story still feels afresh to me and they do live happily ever after.all in all a must watch."
141,Shrek Forever After,,24 May 2010,we've seen it before but it's still a good way to pass the time,"Likableif unnecessarysequel finds Shrek and Fiona adjusting to life now that they're parents. Fed up with his routine as a dad and yearning for a chance to experience life as it once was, Shrek makes a deal with the scheming Rumpelstiltskin to once again feel like a real ogre just for a day, but unfortunately for Shrek there's more to the deal than meets the eye and it may cost him everything he holds dear. Flawed but pleasant sequel is a bit protracted, and has a plot that shamelessly rips-off It's a Wonderful Life, but it works thanks to a lovable cast of characters, some effectively touching moments, and plenty of solid laughs along the way. Film's 3-D effects don't serve any real purpose, but work if you enjoy that sort of thing. **½"
142,Shrek Forever After,8,23 May 2010,Not better than the first two but a nice end to the series.,"Shrek one and two were some of the best animated films ever made. Filled with an all-star cast, great animation, and an original story with a well-written script perfect for its great cast. While the third one didn't live up to the expectations of the first two the fourth one is in ways an improvement.Shrek has always been visually stunning and the characters have always been loving so that isn't the issue. It is the script that could be a problem. While the third one showed a lot of promise it wasn't able to do much with it. However the fourth movie starts showing the promise in it and ends the film series on the right note.Here in Shrek Forever After Shrek is now a domesticated family man who seems to be living the dream. But things start changing when his seemingly perfect life becomes to predictable and boring for him. Now on his children's first birthday he loses it and wishes he was a regular ogre for just one day. Then Rumpelstiltskin comes and says that he can give Shrek what he wants and to get the day he has to give a day. In other words he has to give up a day in his life and what Shrek doesn't realize how it will change his life. Now he finds himself in an alternate reality where Rumpelstiltskin rules and the only thing he can do to change it is to get true loves kiss and break the contract.The story matches up to the better films of the Shrek franchise. It even has some good laughs and action as well. Mixed with 3D making this a fun installment in the Shrek film franchise. However it doesn't mean it doesn't have its flaws. Maybe if the film was a little longer you could have more feel for Shrek when he goes to the alternate reality. It begins showing how miserable he is except it doesn't give us the time to get reacquainted with these great characters. Maybe that's its greatest flaw and that keeps us from truly enjoying the film like we enjoyed the first two films. While it did better than the third film it wasn't able to live up to first two. The 3D makes this film a treat to the eyes while the moments it has can keep you happy throughout the film making this a nice finale to the series about every ones favorite ogre."
143,Shrek Forever After,2,6 June 2010,Boring,The first Shrek was pretty groundbreaking This one just had a lot of gimmicks for the 3D but not the creativity of the first one. The decline of the whole lot has been steady.The grandkids liked it which is why we went but the first ones at least had humor the adults could chuckle at. This one not really.Unless you really want to blow $50 for a family of 4 to see it in 3D wait for the rental or purchase.Well I really don't have much more to say but the rules say I have to put in 10 lines of text.OK - well the fat cat was cute.The babies were cute.The kiss was cute.I yawned through much of it.
144,Shrek Forever After,6,4 June 2010,Familiar but not refreshing...,"What can I really say? It wasn't disappointing as I thought it would be but it was neither good or anything it was just mediocre. Better than the 3rd shrek? Probably or Yes! but still with all the story and characters relationships and all, while we are familiar with Shrek the feeling or the atmosphere that once we all enjoyed disappeared with this fourth and hopefully last movie. It should just rest as it is and should be remembered for it's first 2 parts. We strangely don't feel any emotion towards shrek in this movie besides the fact that we already know this character and we like him for the smile he gave us with his first two parts but now it's just dull and at times it got me bored. As for the script I might admit that it has it's flaws and the dialogue seems old and not something refreshing in many times. The funny moments were not that many in this one, and most of the jokes like I said felt old. It's a near perfect ending though for Shrek and would have been far more better if this was the 3rd movie instead of that failure. The soundtrack itself didn't raised the bar of the movie as well since it was not something that you would normally enjoy unless you're watching a mediocre movie and with all these I'm convinced this might be a good shrek movie but overall is just mediocre though it's well executed. So... watch it once if you're a Shrek fan, if not? ... don't bother because you won't lose anything... It's sad actually but the interest in Shrek actually died I think long before this movie considering even the box-office at the moment which is disappointing... By the way, forgot about the 3d experience; it was fine overall but nothing compared to Alice in Wonderland.Storyline: 7/10. Voice-Acting: 7,5/10. Art Direction: 7/10. Cinematography/Editing: 6,5/10. Animation Originality: 7/10. Score: 6/10. ===================== Overall: 6,8"
145,Shrek Forever After,5,1 June 2010,Flawed Storyline,"For the most part I enjoyed this movie but I have a question that seems to continue to be overlooked...According to the new story, the King and Queen went to Rumpelstiltskin as a last ditch effort to save their daughter. Just as they were about to sign away their kingdom they got word that the Princess had been rescued by Shrek. My question is, if, in Shrek 2, King was involved in the plot with Prince Charming and Fairy Godmother to rescue Fiona and have her marry Charming only to have had Shrek beat him to the castle, then why were they at Rumpelstiltskin's to begin with? If Shrek didn't exist anymore then wouldn't it be safe to assume that Charming would have arrived at the castle and rescued Fiona? I don't think that they ever addressed Prince Charming or Fairy Godmother in this installment. What happened to them? Still, I did enjoy the movie, just found it hard to get passed this error in the storyline."
146,Shrek Forever After,6,25 May 2010,Shrek's Wonderful Life gone forever more ?,"I must be either growing too old for this or this seems like the weakest entry in the Shrek film franchise. Don't get me wrong, it's OK, most of the characters we love are in there, but it feels less inspired. It's as if some of the magic was gone. My mind wandered a few times especially during the action scenes. I smiled a few times but I didn't laugh out loud like in the others. The best joke was a recycled one from previous instalments. To be fair, the audience laughed at regular intervals but nothing crazy like at the best comedies. The jabs at popular culture, political correctness and Disney in particular seemed to be mostly absent. The new characters weren't as memorable as the ones previously introduced. Then again, it's really tough to beat Donkey and Puss'n'Boots for sheer enjoyment. As a matter of fact, the moments involving them were the ones I preferred. The actors voicing them were in fine enthusiastic form. Mike Myers as Shrek was equal to himself, complete with slightly annoying Scottish accent. The 3D animation (in actual 3D with glasses this time) was nice looking, dynamic but didn't blow me away. The story lacks a bit of suspense because it's basically an alternate universe story if Shrek's involvement in important matters had changed, somewhat similar to the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (was that vague enough ? ;-). Throughout the film, you keep thinking things cannot stay that way because it would invalidate the 3 previous films but you don't care very much about that because Shrek is more about fun than mortal danger. I admit that at some point it was clever how the ""easy"" solution was avoided prolonging the shenanigans. Some good humor is found in the new first meetings between Shrek and old friends who don't remember him. Some of the humor falls a bit flat. The movie does have some heart and touching moments. All in all, the supposedly last Shrek movie is watchable and pleasant enough but fails to impress. It also pales compared to previous efforts (ok, not so much compared to the third that a few will argue is worse). If I lowered your expectations just a little, then you can thank me later when you're pleasantly surprised watching this entertaining film ... :-)Rating : 6 out of 10 (good)"
147,Shrek Forever After,7,22 May 2010,Shrek Forever After: Enjoyable!,"Shrek Forever After is said to be the final chapter of the Shrek series. Well, perhaps the final installment is a good installment to finish the Shrek series.Pretty much like the previous series, Shrek Forever After has those fairy tale themes. In this installment, it still has the guts to make you laugh. It can still be called good (although it's not very good). I like the alternate version of Puss in Boots.The story was also quite smart. Well, I still enjoyed it.The appearance of Rumpelstilskin is the thing I like the most. His actions are pretty much laughable. For me, he's the best movie villain for children. Shrek Forever After is more exciting than the previous installments. But, the problem is that it's too short. If you compare it with 'How To Train Your Dragon', 'Dragon' (even though with approximately with the same running time) has many more scenes than 'Shrek' does. It all happens so quickly. It's like having a normal pace in the beginning and then hurrying up in the end. But, Shrek Forever After can still be called an enjoyable film. 7 stars!"
148,Shrek Forever After,4,21 May 2010,A Nutshell Review: Shrek Forever After,"It was 2001 since the first Shrek burst onto the screen, providing us a mean, grumpy and really green ogre as the reluctant hero counted on to save the day, and within this decade spawned a series of shorts, videos and even an amusement park feature. It's probably - and I say probably because box office receipts dictate whether another feature is worthwhile - the final chapter, and how gimmicky can it get to also jump onto the 3D bandwagon?Some of you will already know I'm giving 3D films a miss because frankly, I need to conserve funds. Moreover, the downside of 3D films is already widely publicized, coupled with the cheater-bugs who convert 2D to 3D during post production which I say is a poor man's cousin of the real thing. Unless a film really warrants it, 2D in a digital format will suffice, and so Shrek Forever After falls into this category. Which I thought was still nicely done up since the film has no lack of animated detail, though I shudder to think that because of the plenty of dimly lit, night based scenes, that in 3D format it'll prove disastrous.Anyway, Shrek as a trilogy worked, where we have our protagonists Shrek and Donkey fall in love (not with each other of course) and by the end of the third show, it's happy families all round. But profits dictate that another film be made, and Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke's story seemed to pull out the cheat sheet in now knowing how to move forward with the story, and hence, why not do a little time travel backwards cum alternate universe jig no thanks to the main villain Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohm) harbouring an opportunity to rule Far Far Away back in the first installment, if not for our hero's rescue of Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).The story taps on the mundane existence of our every day lives, devoid of adventure which Shrek (Mike Myers) yearns for, becomes something quite unbearable as he goes through the motions of a routine from dawn till dusk, having to perform the same chores all over again, listen to friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) recount their past adventures ad nauseam, and not having that all important personal Ogre time to relax in a mud pool, or have human beings tremble and run at the sight of him, becoming more of a celebrity hero instead.The themes cannot find the leeway to break out of the formula of learning to appreciate what you have before they're lost, and what true love really means since destiny has it all planned out, no matter how meandering or different the journey now becomes. For Shrek fans, watching Shrek Forever After is like a test of your trivia knowledge, since events and characters start to turn up albeit differently from originally conceived, and fans will likely have a kick out of knowing intimate details on the differences between what's canon, and what has tangent off from the original.As far as laughter and spoofs go, the film adopts a relatively darker mood and tone, with comedy being void of the physical approach, and the smart-alecky modern day references quite absent in this installment. The objective by director Mike Mitchell seems to be one of reinforcing the themes behind what Shrek and friends stand for, rather than to tell a tale of new adventures with new fairy tale characters. After all, this film is an attempt to milk the trilogy one last time through a rehash of premise and characters, so hopefully, Shrek the Ogre can finally find some much needed rest rather than to become a dead horse who's flogged way past its shelf life."
149,Shrek Forever After,6,22 August 2014,Weak finish to the Shrek journey,"After the third installment that just wasn't nearly good as the first 2. Now comes a 4th installment that doesn't add much to the franchise, despite it being the final chapter in the Shrek story. There is no charm or wits to this one. It's like they rand out of ideas and now resorting to the what if scenario. They just don't show the after after forever ever after for a reason. I know it tries to delve into the reality of these stories, but this just falls flat. I was just bored with this one. It's like the failed 3rd installment, they just tried to make it up and finish the story. This is a franchise that had a strong start and just went downhill from there. It's another watchable CGI animated movie, but easily forgettable. And lacked the charm and substance to make it memorable. It's a movie worth watching to finish up the journey though, even if it ends weak. Well at least they tried to finish with at least something somewhat passable. I give this movie a 6 and that is being generous. It doesn't necessarily completely end with a whimper, but it came pretty darn close to that travesty.6/10"
150,Shrek Forever After,9,7 April 2012,Everybody! It's a Celebration!,"Shrek Forever After is a testament to the mega success of the Shrek series  it will not be appreciated by those expecting something radically different from the previous installments or those who are new to the ogre. It brings everything that we have come to adore, love, hate, laugh, cry and celebrate watching tales of Far Far Away. It can be categorized as a 'Best of Shrek Series', along with a few new exciting additions thrown in the mix. Watching Shrek 4, we big a final goodbye to the green, uncouth, bawdy, grumpy ogre who also is compassionate, protective, noble, kind-hearted, funny, diligent and very gullible.Shrek Forever After does not have an innovative storyline  Shrek signs a deal with the malevolent, shrewd Rumpelstiltskin that makes him live the life of a true, nasty ogre for a day, except that the deal has its own causes. Rumpelstiltskin is a known for deliberately distorting meaning and therefore Shrek has to fight all over again for what he had already conquered in an alternate universe. In this world, Fiona is a Che Gueveva like revolutionist who leads an army of ogres to fight off the despotic ruler Rumpelstiltskin and his lair of witches. It is a good versus evil situation between the ogres and Rumpelstiltskin, and Shrek has to break the spell in all this chaos before it is too late.Shrek 4 is not without predictabilities; the entire 'being dad is boring', 'got to save my love', 'sacrificing for my beloved' is done to death before in movies. What makes Shrek Forever After stand out is its commitment to make Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, Puss and all these fairy tale characters a part of our culture. Who would really care for Pinocchio or the Gingerbread man or the three little pigs had they not been revamped in the series? Shrek Forever After brings them all together, tells us to brace ourselves for our final journey and gives us the goodies.The voice acting is like the previous installments, except that there are a additional ones for Rumpelstiltskin, the witches, the extra ogres. The writing is a marked improvement from Shrek 3 because it does not become to self-referential. The gags come at various points, such as when donkey asks Shrek how he knows his name (which is donkey!), or when the Shrek impostors are brought in front of Rumpelstiltskin for rewards. In Shrek 3, it was more about getting surprised at how naughty Rapunzel or Cinderella was. It is good they were not brought back.Shrek 4 is a reminder of Shrek's relevance in pop culture and I raise my glass to it.My Rating: 8.8 out of 10"

152,Shrek Forever After,8,26 November 2011,"Still not as good as the first two, but better than the third, and a great way to end the wonderful series!","While it definitely feels like it's a rehash that's trying to go for the jugular and try to pack some jokes that mirror the first movie, Shrek Forever After is definitely an improvement from Shrek the Third. The plot is that Shrek is bored with his family life, and he decides to sign a deal with Rumpelstilzkin, so that he can become a feared ogre for one day. Did I spell Rumple's name right? Anyways, it turns that the be-careful-what-you-wish-for theme comes true for Shrek, because he has to give up a day of his past in order for the deal to work. Rumpel, being the evil genius that he is, decides to give up the day Shrek was born, so if Shrek can't share true love's kiss (guess who it has to be with), he will no longer be existent.There are definitely a lot of good things to look at here, but I will just focus on the voice acting and the plot, seeing as that's what truly gives the movie away. Myers proves that, despite being a decade older than he was when he first started out as Shrek, he still has the it factor for Shrek. Murphy is just as funny as he was the first time around. Diaz is great as the Princess Fiona, although in this film, we don't see her as being much of a Princess. Banderas is still one of the greatest things to happen to this saga as Puss in Boots. All the other voice actors do their thing, as well.The story works here, too. I personally found this story to work because, well, Shrek has had more at stake here than he had in the previous three movies. In the first two, it was just his love to Fiona that was at stake; from what I remember from the third movie, his life ended up being at stake; in this one, well, not only is it his life, but it's everything about his life that's at stake. Fiona, his children, his friends; if Shrek does not share true love's kiss with Fiona, he will cease to exist, as will the world in which he comes from.The main flaw, however, is that this film relies on too many things from the first movie. First of all, there's the fact that he wants to be a real ogre again. While this does work, it's not as effective as when he is a real ogre in the first film. Secondly, he goes to visit the castle to see if Fiona's still there. Third, the whole true love's kiss thing was the main theme in the first movie, and it's the same here. While I do applaud the makers of this film for successfully coming up with this stuff, it's also the movie's main flaw, since it is too dependant on sources in which those themes work better.Overall, though, I do recommend this movie to all Shrek fans. It's a great ending to the series, and despite the fact that I don't want to say goodbye to the characters, I think it's time. I felt the same way with Toy Story 3; they were about Andy's toys, and since Andy gave them away, it's time to put that series to rest now. But, Toy Story and Shrek, you guys gave me some of the best times of my childhood when I was growing up. I thank you so much for everything that you had to offer. This movie deserves an 8/10 for me."
153,Shrek Forever After,7,13 December 2010,A slight disappointment...,"I just finished watching this on DVD...and I'm happy that I didn't waste my time and money in the theater.Maybe that's a little too rough. The movie wasn't THAT bad, but I thought they could've done ten times better than what I have just watched. The animation was good, the actors were good, blah blah blah. Plot wasn't too bad either. A little dark, but not bad. And they also make some references from the older movies, which I loved.Granted that I had high expectations for it (mostly because I've been told that it was the best one for the series). It wasn't at all funny as I thought it would be, except for a couple moments, and Shrek was so cheesy, it was embarrassing. I mean, even Donkey and Puss weren't that funny, and they usually make the movies.Oh, and I've read about someone saying how it's so horrible of Donkey to call Gingy a ""cracker"", and they said how racial it was. For me, it was hilarious. I don't think they intended for it to be bad, just to make a joke, since Gingy is, in fact, a cracker, and most of the kids wouldn't know anyways.Overall, I gave this movie a 7/10, due to the lack of jokes (that I'm used to seeing from the Shrek series) and Shrek's cheesiness. If you've seen the last three, then I recommend to just finish it up. Like I said, it's not THAT bad, but I wouldn't buy it."
154,Shrek Forever After,3,9 December 2010,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Shrek Forever AfterThe best part of living in a fairy tale is that if you can trick a troll into wearing its clothes backwards, the talking fish will revert back to your lost sense of courage.In fact, every contract in a fable has a clause, and that's exactly what Shrek (Mike Meyers) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) are looking for in this fourth installment.Fed up with family life, Shrek makes an imprudent pact with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), in which the trickster makes it so he never existed.Trapped in a world ruled by Rumpelstiltskin, where Fiona (Cameron Diaz) leads a group of agitators, Shrek must share true love's kiss by day's end. Like its reference to It's a Wonderful Life, Shrek 4 would be better off if it never existed: the story's uninspired, the characters are tired, and the songs are lame.Besides, any deal that doesn't involve your first-born isn't worth making. (Red Light)"
155,Shrek Forever After,4,25 August 2010,The worst in the bunch of good films.,"For a long time I've heard and read very negative things about Shrek the Third, which I enjoyed, a lot, but I was still looking forward to this supposed final chapter in the very popular series by DreamWorks Animation.Shrek has grown tired of his family life and longs to be that monstrous and wild feared ogre he once was. His reputation has gone down the drain and now his swamp is a tourist attraction sight, and he is constantly tired out by family commitments and chores. Desperate to live his old life for one more day, he signs a contract with the scheming Rumplestiltskin but in return lives a day where Donkey works for evil witches, Puss is a fat overfed cat and Fiona is the leader of a group of freedom fighting ogres. The problem is that none of them remember Shrek, at all.This should have been the ultimate Shrek movie, but it is not. The problem with this is that surprisingly, the characters have no scope, except Shrek and maybe Fiona, who is a, feisty and somewhat pleasing to eyes, ogress. All the beloved characters from Donkey and Puss to Gingy and Pinocchio have nothing to do but appear briefly. The emphasis here is on Shrek's journey of realisation. Though Mike Myers is great as Shrek, the character himself was never the strong point in the series and therefore to have him roam around for the majority of the film trying to fix things was not appealing.The animation is awesome and supersedes anything we've seen before in a Shrek film but that is just not enough for me. My 4-year old son laughed, jumped and cheered at all the right predictable places but I managed to smile maybe once, if that.Of course it's really good to hear Murphy, Banderas and even Julie Andrews familiar voices but the jokes are dry and like I said before, Donkey and company really don't have all that much to do. And we don't even know what happened to that famous character Arthur. Remember him? Another downer in this film is that we don't see much of Pinocchio or Gingy, both of which are extremely enjoyable to watch. But the biggest let down of all is Rumplstiltskin. First of all, in the previous film he looks totally different to what he looks in this, even though his one line cameo in Shrek the Third may go unnoticed. Secondly, the voice for this character is so cringe-worthy I had trouble keeping a straight face every time he spoke, and believe me, I was not laughing.Once this is over, there are many things that pop into your head and none of these are in favour of this tripe. I honestly tried to like this film because I enjoyed the previous three immensely but when you wish that this had now never been made or that Dreamworks should have brought back Prince Charming and Justin Timberlake's ""Atrie"" you know then that this is not the best film to come out of this studio.It's not Dreamworks worst film but it surely is on par with the worst, which in my opinion is Shark Tale, though I have not seen that Bee Movie.On a more positive note, I have mentioned that the animation is very good but the expressions of Rumplestiltskin are excellent. From his sparkling and pleading eyes to his ever so grim and maniacal snort, you cannot complain that visually he is a marvellous character to view. And then we also get to see a whole army of ogres, all of which are strangely and positively different from one another. Their secret hideout and their vastness I appreciated and though very predictable, I did enjoy how Shrek tries to make Fiona remember who he is. Also, the ogre babies are extremely adorable.BEST SCENE: There isn't one, honestly. I did however giggle when warrior Gingy starts to attack Shrek's boot.FINAL VERDICT: Unfortunately, Dreamworks have thought about the money and not much about this very poor story. Animation aside, this film is very weak and if it wasn't for the characters we all know and love, I'd say this was really, really bad. Whoever says this is better than Shrek the Third seriously needs their head checking out.4/10  Average"
156,Shrek Forever After,4,16 July 2010,Trailer looked promising.......,"The 3D effects are quite nice, but if you are looking for a good laugh then watch the first Shrek again. While I watched the movie in a Hong Kong cinema I recall maybe 3 times that viewers, of which 50% young children, really had to laugh, I mean this belly shaking, tears rolling over your cheeks laughter. The idea itself is not bad, but the execution is mediocre and worst of all they took out the fun part. I wonder if the creators had to laugh about it themselves. I really tried to have an enjoyable 93 minutes, but Shrek did not deliver. I wouldn't say it is a complete waste of time, but unless you are an true Shrek addict or like 3D effects, you may spend your time on funnier movies. I hope the makers will have a look at Shrek 1 one more time, before they might create another part in this 'everlasting' series."
157,Shrek Forever After,7,7 July 2010,Had its moments,"I enjoyed this 4th trip to the well, particularly the 3D (which was very effective), but there were things to point out which were less than positive.Rumpelstiltskin didn't really seem to work. I could see what they were up to but, to me, something wasn't quite right. Maybe it was the voice performance (Wally Dohrn, whoever he is), maybe the trade-off between superficially charming but inwardly villainous was slightly off, but on some level it didn't work.Puss was woefully underused. Limited to a series of fat gags, most of which had been used in the trailers, he may as well not have been there.The ogre babies, potentially great characters, were also underused.The story, though good, was essentially a retread of the first movie, albeit complicated by alternate realities causes and effects which may have been over-confusing for younger children.Far fewer gags than in previous efforts.But I did enjoy it."
158,Shrek Forever After,7,7 July 2010,Enjoyable but not much originality,"Shrek 4 is enjoyable but it is clear the franchise has reached the end of its tether. There are a few good gags and the affection we have for the main characters almost wills us to enjoy the ride but we are going over very familiar territory.Shrek becomes bored with mundane family life and does a deal with Rumplestiltskin for a day as a ""real"" ogre. In return Rumplestliltskin gets to erase the day Shrek was born which means (the details aren't really important) that Mr R now rules Far Far Away. As a character Rumplestiltskin has a few amusing quirks, such as having a different wig for every occasion and having witches for henchmen. However he isn't as entertaining as the original characters.The rest of the film involves Shrek trying to get out of the deal as well as convincing Fiona (who now doesn't know him) that he is her true love. We also meet alternative reality versions of Puss and Donkey.The kids will enjoy the slapstick and funny voices but accompanying adults will realise early on that this film was really only made for the money."
159,Shrek Forever After,3,30 June 2010,In three feature films did Shrek really learn nothing about the meaning of true happiness?,"In the kingdom of Far Far Away Shrek (Mike Myers) is at a crossroads in his life. He is unhappy with his marriage to Fiona (Cameron Diaz) because of the endless cycle of having to look after his children and the constant interruptions at the hands of the likes of Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and the village townsfolk. Shrek's home has also been turned into a tourist attraction because people do not find him scary anymore. At his kid's birthday party Shrek has a meltdown and wishes that he could go back to before he rescued Fiona. His wish is granted when he meets the evil Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who promises Shrek one day from when he used to be a scary ogre in favour of giving him one day from his childhood. Rumpelstiltskin chooses Shrek's birth and thus Shrek is swept back into an alternate time period where Rumpelstiltskin has become the ruler of Far Far Away. Shrek, with the help of Donkey, must break the deal by sharing true loves kiss with Fiona who is now the warrior of an underground ogre rebellion plotting against Rumpelstiltskin. The most troubling problem for Shrek is that Fiona does not recognise him and simply sees him as just another desperate ogre.In three feature films did Shrek really learn nothing about the meaning of true happiness? From the very first Shrek film in 2001 the coda of the franchise has remained the same: to love yourself and others for who they are. Shrek Forever After is the fourth and apparently last film in the series and the material here is disappointingly tiresome at best. It might have made for a much better second film than a fourth entry. Persisting with the same character for this long requires the urgency to find new conflicts for them to solve, which will allow them to realise something they have not already discovered in themselves in the previous entries. With each new chapter this becomes increasingly difficult. Shrek's domestic problems and parenting issues are not particularly funny. They just lend the film an initially awkward and harsh tone that makes one question how the jolly green giant became this naive. Isn't this the same Shrek who came to realise that you don't know what you've got till it's gone nearly nine years ago?There are echoes here of Frank Capra's classic film It's A Wonderful Life (1946), in which George Bailey was shown by a guardian angel what life would be like in an alternate world if he was never born. But even the mirroring of this great film can do very little to spark the charm here as many of the once likable character have now lost their appeal. This is largely the fault of the screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke, not just because the same thematic material is recycled but also because the film just isn't particularly funny. There are very few laughs in the opening quarter and the wit of the first two films just seems absent. At just ninety minutes the film is mercifully brief and there are a few sweet moments towards the end shared between Shrek and Fiona but the journey here still feels oddly compressed. Limiting Shrek to just a day of happiness is problematic because it means that most of the events of the film are crammed into almost a single evening, making it feel rather small and insignificant. Despite the lack of sight gags, director Mike Mitchell has done a credible job with the visual aspects though. The film is regularly beautiful to look at with the various 3D effects and touches of depth. Yet once this novelty wears offs, it is still an expensive price to pay for lazy, albeit pretty, sequel.Shrek Forever After is a really disappointing finale for what was once a landmark in animated pictures. It's an example of the way a very clever and charming idea has been laboured far too often by the studio system. The plotting here is predictable, unfunny and derivative; a complete contrast to how one would describe the first film. Very small children who might not be particularly fussed about what they have already seen may enjoy it but to the parents who will have to take them it is sadly difficult to recommend the film for them in either 2D or 3D."
160,Shrek Forever After,6,13 June 2010,moments are great but the story is too well known for it to fully work,"Its a another remake of Its a Wonderful Life but with ogres and fairy tale characters.I'm really split about this film. They got so much right, the love between Shrek and Fiona for example, that you wonder why they bothered to remake a classic film. I mean the emotion and the bits work but the central plot is too worn and Rumpelstiltskin is too big a jerk Frankly had they managed to do something new, change the story around some how so it wasn't a direct steal this probably would be better, possibly the best of the films. But something doesn't work and despite getting so much dead on right there is a sense that they didn't care enough to completely make a full fledged film.Worth seeing, more so than the last two, but I'd wait for DVD...something I should have done."
161,Shrek Forever After,7,8 June 2010,not boring,"In this fourth and final installation in the Shrek franchise, our green hero feels emasculated by the grind of domesticity and worn down by the demands of celebrity. Shrek wants to return days, when he was an awful ogre. He has a wish for just one day to cavort in his old life of swampy bachelor hood. After a fight with Fiona, Shrek is easy picking for Rumpelstiltskin and one of his less-than-square deal contract/ Shrek gives up a day from his real life. Rumpelstiltskin takes turns out to be the day Shrek was born. And when the day is over, Shrek will be died. Even Shrek old friends don't know him, because they have never ever met Shrek. At best, it is a pleasant way to kill 90 minutes, at worst, it is disposable. In both cases, it proves, that the series needs to retire. p.s. The movie has a good soundtrack "
162,Shrek Forever After,6,4 June 2010,"Makes you forget and forgive the existence of the third Shrek, even when it still falters against the original","The Shrek franchise has risen from a good competitor against Disney and Pixar to a mere joke that still makes money because it appeals to the kids. By the time the third Shrek rolled around, the green ogre went from a clever family comedy with subtle adult humor to an unfunny kiddie flick with very little entertainment whatsoever. This is why I was prepared to shun and practically avoid the fourth and final installment beyond any means necessary. Unfortunately for us moviegoers though, the month of May offered practically nothing outside the Iron Man (and maybe Prince of Persiamaybe) realm. And with the next major major release not happening until mid-June, Shrek Goes Fourth was the final option. Now, there are some good news and bad news with the final installment. The good news is this film redeems itself for the rather mediocre sequel and the repulsive third one. The bad news is, the film still is weaker than anything Pixar (and quiet third party Blue Sky) has produced, and even weaker then some of Dreamworks' greatest hits. At least the sentimental value and heart of the original is duplicated here, even if the wit and nonstop humor disappeared. The pop culture references aren't as rampant but aren't as good either, while the random musical numbers and dances just don't cut it like they used to. Despite all that griping, it still remains a ho-hum ending to a ho-hum quadrilogy. In Shrek Forever After or whatever it is called nowadays, we follow Shrek (Mike Myers) as he is becoming quite bored of his watered-down lifestyle of being a father, husband, and town hero. In the midst of the frustrations, he makes a deal with Rumpelstilskin, resulting in him creating a world in which he was never born---resulting in Rumpelstilskin being king of the land. In this alternate universe, he must win the heart of Fiona (Cameron Diaz) all over again before his existence begins to deteriorate. One funny note though, there is no mention of Artie and his new reign of king.The script is a small retread of the original, mixed in with It's a Wonderful Life and even unexpected parallels to Beauty and the Beast. In other words, the script isn't very original, but does offer a chance to inject some heart into a franchise that lost all of it a couple of years ago. Written by John Klausner (Shrek the Third) and Darren Lemke (Lost), this final chapter has a lot of references to the original Shrek and its sequel, while avoiding all the Disney-bashing the first three were known for. Sadly though, outside the Disney bashing, Shrek didn't have a lot of humor, which makes this Shrek one of the weaker ones in terms of humor. The laughs are mildly there, but mostly coming from the supporting cast (Once again, Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots stealing the show). With Shrek losing his main love and struggling to win her again, the heartstrings are tugged a bit. Director Mike Mitchell paces the movie well by quickly showing the source of Rumpilstilskin's rage as well as the source of Shrek's troubles. While American Beauty jump-started the middle aged-crisis thing to holy heaven back in 1999, Shrek Forever After still remains a bit fresh by giving us a little time and alternate universe travel. While I was never a fan of Dreamworks trying to infuse heart into any of their movies (I see them more as the antidepressant of Pixar's excellent but heart-destroying films), Shrek is a definite exception. The core of the four films has been the characters and their love for each other, so when the climax approaches, expect to be a bit moved, even when you haven't been laughing. Bottom Line: Shrek's final trip into the movie theaters was better than I had expected, but still wasn't as funny as the first two, which is what I did expect. You can run on competitive bashing and pop culture humor for so long before you quickly run out of steam. While I believe this fairy tale ran two movies too long, the finale is definitely worthy of a viewing if you love the green ogre and all his friends. The supporting cast provided the laughs, while the main characters provided the heart. This is by no means a triumph, but isn't a total toad wreck either. Dreamworks however really needs to lay off the pace-breaking and unfunny and uninteresting musical bits. Let the spin-offs begin!"
163,Shrek Forever After,,2 June 2010,Did We Need Another One?,"OK...so I really liked the other Shrek movies. How could you not laugh at jokes and perfect comedy connections of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy? All in all, it was box office gold and entertained families as well..no argument there at all...but then they decide to make just one more..for reasons unknown. Sure, all the original characters are there..the cute ones, silly ones, weird ones and slightly freaky ones too. And then here comes Rumplestiltskin...? Who has an attitude or a mental illness...I was not quite sure which really. He looks bizarre and stupid...not scary or anything even remotely close to that. He screws up everything for Shrek...and the story is re-told..sort of. Most of it made no sense to me really. An ogre with a mid-life crisis? They tried too hard to make Shrek and Fiona appear to be human..the couple with too many kids, no time, etc....yawn. As funny as some parts were(fat Puss In Boots...the best part)....other parts made it a yawn fest. You cannot claim it was a movie geared at kids because even though it has marketing ties with toys, etc...it had too many jokes and puns only grownups would understand. The studio, etc...simply wanted to cash in a little more on stuff it already cashed in on once before. Leave it all alone and come up with something new and creative please. Hopefully, that will be possible at some point. I can only hope the planned movie based on ""Puss"" will be worth watching when it premieres."
164,Shrek Forever After,6,1 June 2010,"Heavy on sentimentality, light on laughs","I must begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this movie, even after having been somewhat burned by Shrek The Third, so my expectations walking into the theatre may have been a bit high. That being said, I walked out of the theatre disappointed, and I must admit, feeling a bit tacky for having that reaction to this movie. Mike Meyers and company obviously were going for sentimentality in this, the reported last installment of the series, and that's fine, that's their right and their call. It is not however, the reason most adults would go to see this movie. Shrek has always been about smart comedy, about cutting wit and social lampooning, about characters you love and love to laugh at, or with. While that all slipped a bit in Shrek The Third, it was almost totally absent in this film. And that's fine, if that was what Mr. Myers and company were going for, it's not why I ponied up nine bucks to go see it. There were brief, very brief glimpses of what this movie could have been, of what made the Shrek franchise so well loved; Rumplestilskin screaming ""chimychangas"" in horror as the ogre chef launched them at him in the climatic final battle. The two witches standing on the parapet above the ogres and pointing out; ""We can hear you you know"". Rumplestilskin prancing on the table with the glass of water while his witch minions look on in terror. There were a few others that escape me at the moment but only a few, a very few. The jokes in this movie were glaringly apparent in their absence, or maybe it was that those that were there totally missed the mark, like the two wagon witches whipping Donkey to make him change tunes, I know that was meant to be funny, it wasn't. As I've said, it appears that Mr. Myers and company chose to go the sentimental route in this final film and that's what they did. This movie was dripping with sentimentality, to the point that I felt as if I'd developed diabetes by the time it was over. I didn't go to this movie to bid a tearful goodbye to the Shrek franchise, I went bid a hilarious farewell with bits like the white bronco chase, or Puss in Boots catnip bust, or the Gingerbread Man torture scene, or countless others. I went to enjoy one last look at a group of funny and likable and sweet characters. That was what Shrek has always been about. Instead they went for the sentimental goodbye and I left the theatre feeling a bit tacky because I felt like I should have jumped on board, that I should have joined in on the tearful, touchy feely goodbye to the franchise. But I just couldn't because as I said, that's not what Shrek was ever about and that's not what I went to see. Instead of going out with a tear they should have gone out the way they came in, with a laugh."
165,Shrek Forever After,7,31 May 2010,Decent If Not As Fresh as 1 or 2,"A good deal of the critical complaining about this one is simply that it's derivative of a well loved Jimmy Stewart classic - _It's a Wonderful Life_'. In a modest way it is, but it also goes its own way enough that it's hardly a duplication of that flick.What bothers me about that complaint is simply that most Hollywood movies today - those loved or despised - are remakes of something which came before. It seems that for maybe 80 years or so, Hollywood was capable of coming up with original material, but lately that has waned. Perhaps the movie makers have become as script conservative as they are politically liberal. I'm not sure.There were perhaps five coming attractions before Shrek 4 started. Of the five, four were clear remakes, some bearing even the same title as the original. One example is the newest _Karate Kid_ which based on the previews probably uses the same script word for word as the original. On the way out of the theater we saw a poster for the upcoming _Predator_ which showed a monster identical to the one which threatened Arnie maybe 25 years ago.So complaining that Shrek 4 borrows thematically from a well loved movie is hardly valid unless you choose to see no movies at all because they all do it today.On the positive side, the movie is engaging. We enjoyed the 3D and I found the textures and animation as good as I've ever seen. I'm wondering if movies such as this have put paid to live human actors. I suspect it's close.No, this one isn't nearly as fresh as the first simply because it's fourth, not first, but it's fine family entertainment with a terrific look and a message which, if not original, is still quite valid. Just sit back and enjoy it."
166,Shrek Forever After,7,30 May 2010,"The Shrek series is done, but don't be surprised if there is a fifth one.","After a full decade, the popular Ogre series is finally coming to an end. The ride was a great experience but did come with some bumps along the way. The first one was a classic that many still have on VHS like myself, and the second one was a welcoming sequel that also became a classic. However, in 2007 the third installment came in where many people did not like it at all where Prince Charming was not a liked character at all. It was a bland story and seemed like a bridge type movie just to get to the fourth one. The last one Shrek Forever After in my opinion was a pretty good final installment. Shrek began having many problems and issues like many new fathers have and cannon handle it. He just wants to get away from everything just for a day but of course everything goes wrong. After the sort of annoying beginning it was a great story and ended really well reminding us of interesting points form the first movie. Overall, even though it was offered in 3D it was not a great 3D movie. Yeah the characters and scenery stuck out like it was in in HD but there was no real distinct WOW points that looked like something was jumping out at you. In the end, it was cool to see in 3D but if your not the biggest fan, and want to save a few bucks then you can just see the regular. It was a great era of Shrek where they are ALREADY talking about a fifth installment about Puss in Boots."
167,Shrek Forever After,7,29 May 2010,It's a Wonderful Life... with Shrek!,"Good ol' Shrek. Just when you think the series was done, we got another sequel as I like to call it ""The Search For More Money"". But it's actually a fun series, even though the third Shrek wasn't exactly that good, it's still a fun story to get into. The characters, the love, the romance, the comedy, the animation is all in good fun. So I saw Shrek Forever After last night with decent hope that this would be better than the third, it actually was, it was a good step up. But it seems like this could be more of a TV series now, you know how every Christmas most sit-com's have a ""what if It's a Wonderful Life"" type of episode? This is just like Shrek Forever After, Shrek has hit his mid life crisis, true, even fairy tale characters hit a mid life crisis. Which is funny because I discussed with my friends about what does happen after the ""Happily Ever After""? Did Sleeping Beauty and her prince ever have trouble paying off the castle? Did Snow White and her prince ever disagree on disciplining the kids? Shrek answers those questions finally.Shrek has grown tired of his life being a local celebrity and his overwhelming family and friends, as well as the fact he feels he isn't a ""real ogre"" anymore. When they arrive at Far, Far Away for the ogre babies' first birthday, an angry mob become fans and asks Shrek to autograph pitch forks and torches, a boy asks him to do his roar, and the three pigs eats the birthday cake. All this makes Shrek roar in frustration and everyone applauds; he smashes a new cake and angrily leaves the castle. Outside, Fiona talks to Shrek about his anger and his wish to be a real ogre again. Fiona tells Shrek he has everything, but doesn't see it, and she heads back inside the castle. Shrek sees Rumpelstiltskin, who has been vowing vengeance against Shrek who he feels took the kingdom away from him. Rumpelstiltskin offers him a day to feel like a real ogre again, in exchange for a day from Shrek's childhood. Shrek agrees and signs the contract. He sees how Far Far Away has been turned into a slum and Fiona, now taking lessons from Xena the Warrior Princess, along with other ogres are to be captured by Rumpelstiltskin, the only way to break this awful curse is the kiss of true love before sunset.Is Shrek worth the ticket price? I would say this is more of a matinée, it's very cute and has some good jokes, but nothing to get excited over. With the 3D price, no, I saw the 2D version and was perfectly happy with it, so you don't have to pay the extra price, there was nothing ""eye popping"" about the movie. The only thing that makes this movie a step down from the first 2 Shreks is the side characters. In the second Shrek we were introduced to some wonderful side characters like the Fairy God Mother, self centered Prince and my favorite, Puss in Boots. Now it seems like the side characters were just thrown in randomly for sake of them being there. I wished they had a little more to add to the story than they had, like I said it felt more like a TV show vs. a movie. But I have to admit the fat Puss in Boots nearly killed me, I couldn't stop laughing how we see him in a pink bow instead of his typical outfit. Shrek is definitely worth the watch, this was a good movie, maybe made more so for money, but a big step up from the third Shrek.7/10"
168,Shrek Forever After,8,25 May 2010,The Story Comes to a Magical End!!!,"I saw this with a friend earlier, and it was a lot better than we expected. Shrek isn't feeling too happy with his life with everyone, and wants everything quiet, the way it used to be. Shrek meets up with Rumpelstiltskin, who makes him a deal; if Shrek gives him a day from his past, Rumpel will give Shrek a day where he will be feared again. Unfortunately, Rumpel takes the day that Shrek was born. Fiona, Donkey, Puss in Boots and the rest of the gang don't even know him. Shrek only has 24 hours to figure out how to return his life to normal, and get Fiona to fall in love with him again. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend SHREK FOREVER AFTER!!!"
169,Shrek Forever After,8,24 May 2010,A fitting final chapter to the fabled franchise in this never-ending- story!,"SHREK FOREVER AFTER (2010) *** (VOICES OF : Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, Jon Hamm, John Cleese, Craig Robinson, Walt Dohrn, Jane Lynch, Lake Bell, Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Kristen Schaal, Meredith Viera, Ryan Seacrest, Larry King, Regis Philbin, Conrad Vernon.) Better-than-anticipated 'final chapter' to the never-ending story of the lovable titular ogre and his brood that finds the not-so-jolly-green-giant in a funk wishing he was living his old days of yore which leads to runty Rumpelstiltskin to enter the picture  with a vendetta  to offer him a wish come true ala ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with predictable yet entertaining results. Once again Banderas steals the show as Puss In Boots but this time as a fat cat (literally) and Murphy's braying jack-ass Donkey having a field day and chewing the animated scenery. While it wouldn't be terrible if the powers that be do intend to close the nursery rhyme book on this fabled franchise it wouldn't hurt if they had one more verse to throw in for good measure (note: the IMAX 3-D version works yet it is not a must-see by any means in this medium). (Dir: Mike Mitchell)"
170,Shrek Forever After,8,23 May 2010,"To me, on par with Shrek 2.","Lots of people were disappointed with Shrek the third. I was a little too. Because it didn't compare to the first two. So I went to see the new one last night,and it was a breath of fresh air. This one was at times hilarious, and like the good older ones, lots of fun.We open to Shrek(once again voiced by Mike Myers) going through kind of like a crisis. He's not the ogre he once was. And He doesn't like it. So after an outburst at his child's birthday party, Shrek bumps into Rumplestilskin(Voiced by Walt Dohrn), who kind of has a beef with Shrek cause he ruined his business.Stilskin tricks him into a deal.The deal: Shrek will be an ogre again for one day.As it turns out though, in this new world, ogres are hunted, Rumplestilskin is king, and everything is bad. Donkey(voiced by Eddie Murphey) is a slave, Puss(voiced by Antonio Banderas)is fat, and Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz) is an ogre resistance leader and Shrek has til midnight to make Fiona fall in love with him again otherwise he's dead.I just gave you the whole plot. Now Shrek forever after isn't as exhilarating as Shrek but to me it is on par with Shrek 2. I laughed numerous times,even if it was kind of strange. And for a fourth part in a series, it's not a disappointment. So, thumbs up for Shrek 4.Shrek forever after: B+"
171,Shrek Forever After,7,22 May 2010,The magic of a lover's kiss.,"Not too arguably the most endearing animated series, Shrek reaches its final chapter in SHREK FOREVER AFTER. The franchise has been very good for Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas. The original was pure bliss and really encouraging to look forward to what would follow. Unfortunately the second and third episodes gradually got worse. The fourth installment is not as magical as the original, but a whole lot better than the two middle flicks. Being in 3D may have been and enticement, but this is Shrek. Far, far away is in for some changes as the green ogre becomes complacent and temporarily not happy with his marriage and fatherhood. He makes a deal with the shady Rumpelstiltskin(Walt Dohrn)to trade off a day of his childhood, not knowing that he gives away the day of his birth. True friends Donkey and Puss are instrumental in bringing Shrek and Fiona back together... forever after.Others lending voices: John Cleese, Jane Lynch, Mike Mitchell, Lake Bell, Meredith Veira, Ryan Secrest, Larry King and Julie Andrews. And what would a Shrek movie be without the tunes? This time we hear from The Carpenters, The Beastie Boys and Stevie Wonder. A very nice and positive way to say farewell to a franchise."
