0,Shrek,8,1 February 2005,A Wonderful Achievement,"Shrek is a wonderful parody of every fairytale story that you can think of, for the kids it has charm, humour and tons of fun, and is a delightful film for them to enjoy. In addition, Shrek has plenty of subtle innuendo and more adult themes running seamlessly along side the story, much of which may pass younger children by, without spoiling any element of their enjoyment; while at the same time enhancing the enjoyment for the older viewers.Shrek is simply so well created that it can successfully appeal to a huge audience excellently voiced as it is, by Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy.Brilliant characters, solid script and hilarious parody, make this film a simply wonderful achievement, and that's without mentioning the awesome computer generated world that houses it.8/10"
1,Shrek,,17 June 2001,Left-field fairy tale left us rolling in the aisles,"9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of ""Shrek"". We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs' Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up ""WHAT's he compensating for?"" cracked me up...Be warned that this movie is a non-stop send-up of all things Disney. If predictability and saccharine is your cup of tea, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you are cynical about theme parks and like the idea of fairytale classics getting the Monty Python treatment, you'll love it. Every time a scene looks familiar, it means it is about to go pear-shaped. And it's not just old classics that get the treatment. I spotted (mis)quotes from films that are just being released, both Disney and non-Disney. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in ""Shrek"".As a fairytale, however offbeat, ""Shrek"" is tighter plotted and better characterised than most Hollywood dross.The parodic twists, a love story subplot that owes more to Shakespeare's comedies than fairytale formula, and the ""ugly is the new beautiful"" Message more than make up for the derivativeness due to extensive quotation.As for the acting, confinement to voice-overs keeps the egos of Myers and Murphy in check, and they do a fantastic job as the big fat green smelly recluse and the obnoxiously manic donkey respectively. Diaz is great as a feisty princess who reminds me of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy crossed with Lara Croft. Lithgow's Farquaad is a wonderful Bad Guy, modelled on Olivier's Richard III apart from his Little Problem being different. And the Fairytale Creatures...excellent, all of them. The graphics, of course, are state of the art for at least another 2 weeks. We're talking freckles, skin pores and stubble, pupil dilation, and amazing light-and-shade. They had to tone down the realism of the humanoids to stop them looking creepily android-like.Highly recommended, except for overly precious schmalz addicts."
2,Shrek,10,8 September 2002,Brilliant humor!,"Shrek is completely new.  Never has a fully CGI movie taken on the twists, turns, and surprises as Shrek has.  It's a full parody of numerous fairytales, and its humor is, well, humor at its best.  Grown men will laugh at the jokes of Farquaad's Stature and the hidden meaning behind every little comment.  Of course Shrek, like all other movies, has its emotional moments (so what if I lied about it being completely new?).  And these moments aren't cheesy or anything.  They are kind of funny, but at the time of viewing you won't really feel like laughing.  You'll feel like the characters.Like its CGI, Shrek has taken a new dimension.  It stretches out.  You're in the movie.  No, wait, you're watching a movie.  It's so hard to tell.  The characters are so real, so lifelike, it makes you feel you're there.  The environments are realistic, yet still animated.  The wind whispers through the grasslands and the characters' hair; the lightning and clouds are really there... aren't they?I was stunned and absorbed in this movie.  And unlike other movies, it has more than just CGI.  It's actually got a plot.  And what a plot it's got! This one is totally new.  Shrek is ordered to rescue a princess from the fiery keep guarded by a dragon in order to clear out his swamp of the menacing fairytale creatures.But it doesn't stop there.  The movie is full of surprises and stretches on further into what actually happens after.  The dialogue demands your attention throughout the movie, and then the dragon comes in.  Whenever you see the dragon, you'll know good things are bound to happen (but not necessarily for the characters in the movie).  The dragon is a comic relief, but still provides most of the action in the movie.  She chases Donkey and Shrek through the keep, she flies to help rescue Fiona from a despicable marriage, and she even has the satisfaction of swallowing a midget.Now some disputes have arisen about certain things.  But I must say what I always say:  this is only a movie, and it has no deeper meaning (despite the parodies).  Take it as it is.  There can be nothing offensive from Shrek unless you have something against overthrowing tyrants and good-natured humor.I must take a moment to speak about Donkey.  He is, and always will be, one of my most favorite characters in the world of movies.  Eddie Murphy was, no doubt, the perfect actor for him.  He is so funny, so unique, and so... fluffy.  What a perfect donkey!  His design is flawless and his dialogue perfect.  I can find nothing bad about this character.Shrek is perfect for everybody to see.  The little ones will love the vivid colors and lush landscapes.  The adults will enjoy this as well as the intelligent humor and deep plot.  And no one could dislike the arrangement of songs.  They fit really nice into the movie.  Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's composed music is impressive (especially the theme for Escape from the Dragon).Shrek is brilliant moviemaking.  With a groundbreaking DVD, an all-star cast, great music, excellent graphics, and a great parodized yet original plot and storyline, Shrek is no doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen."
3,Shrek,,2 December 2003,Wicked,"Shrek is one hell of an animated ride, and right when you're certain you know where to expect the next gag it one ups you. If you need a reason to see Shrek, here is that reason: imagine Eddie Murphy as an annoying not to mention obnoxious talking donkey. Yeah. Eddie Murphy gives Robin Williams a serious run for his money in terms of greatest animated side kick. From there we get Mike Myers voicing a big green ogre, who plays off Eddie Murphy with perfect comedic timing like the two were meant to do this film together. Shrek is merciless in its humor. Targeting everything from fairy tales to Disney films to narrative clichés to bad puns, sliding in its own commentary, all the while giving the typical fantasy story a few modern twists and turns to deliver a strangely original unoriginal story with original unoriginal characters . . . that doesn't make sense, but Shrek does, does it well, and doesn't care. And you never know where this humor is going to come from, either  either visual gag, musical nod, or spoken dialogue. All three provide their share of narrative and commentary to the concepts in Shrek. I think the beauty of Shrek is it's taken the typical fairy tale (which all of us have heard), and it answers the silly 'what if . . .' and 'why don't they ever . . .' questions we tend to ask. But that's not the core of the story - the core of this story is the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, which works in a funny goofball, but touching and unique way. If the audience can buy into Shrek and Donkey's relationship to one another, then they can believe entire film (which more or less focuses on the adventure the two share together). True, Shrek has a love theme . . . but it's Donkey and Shrek who sustain the film through most of the picture. As for Cameran Diaz and John Lithgow, while not on screen as much as our two heroes, still play an important role. I wouldn't want to downplay Lithgow and Diaz who do bring their respective characters to life, but Shrek is a tale about an enduring friendship with a romance story on the side."
4,Shrek,8,4 September 2003,State-of-the-art computer animation used to tell a cracking little story,"Shrek is a green ogre who lives in a swamp, but his king sends him on a mission which he must complete to get his own land back.You only have to watch ten minutes of this film to realise that this is going to be a classic. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Ok the plot is old, new, borrowed and blue (all recaps and references to fairy tales), but I don't care. It is all so much good fun and better than that, the kind of thing that can be enjoyed by young and old, male or female. It is really a dream of movie and some brilliant pop tunes are employed that really work fantastically against the images. Real tear-to-the-eye stuff.A real bliss-out of a movie and all parties should be congratulated for making it so great. A real DVD buyer, because it can be enjoyed over and over again. Bring on the follow up, I can't wait."
5,Shrek,,12 September 2001,Shrek is a delight for all ages!,"Shrek is a movie like no other.  It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is ""She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy.""  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp ""farting,"" that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations. Shrek has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike."
6,Shrek,8,10 June 2004,Green Power,"""Shrek"" is fun. People who haven't seen this movie, and are wary of seeing what's popular, should give it a try. It's worth watching, and will probably win you over.Taking a Fractured Fairy Tale approach to a ""Beauty And The Beast""-type plot, throwing in a few mild profanities, flatulence jokes, and Michael Myers' over-the-top faux-Scots accent, ""Shrek"" shows off a very snarky humor, full of jokes that will likely go over the heads of a cartoon's target audience while registering with their parents. 'Sure it's big enough, but look at the location,' Shrek observes upon seeing a giant castle in the middle of nowhere. The kids, though, will love 'Shrek' every bit as much. It's impossible not to be carried along by its merry madness.Myers, as the title character, is certainly easier to take than he was in his last Austin Powers movie, his voice work registering real tenderness as well as the expected laughs as a misunderstood ogre who would rather tell a group of frightened villagers about the cruelties he will inflict on them and their dead bodies than cause those villagers any genuine harm. He's a bit of a softie, actually, and scared to let anyone know it.Cameron Diaz is as beautiful to listen to hear as she is to look at in her other films. Her character, Princess Fiona, doesn't have as much room to shine as Shrek (the balance turns out better in the sequel) but she does well with what she's given.The comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek's donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Murphy never stops being funny even as he helps set up key plot moments; in fact he's never been this funny since the first ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movie. ""We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles,"" the donkey tells a much put-upon Shrek, and you still laugh the fifth time you hear it. Lithgow just makes you smile whenever he opens his mouth, like when he grills a hapless gingerbread man in such a convoluted way it turns into a nursery-rhyme recitation.Why exactly Farquaad is grilling this gingerbread man so closely isn't clear, and there are similar plot holes throughout the movie. Shrek may be too tame a character; we never really feel any worry around him. The donkey falls into a relationship with a dragon that screams ""plot convenience,"" and there are strange little bits of cruelty, like turning a frog and snake into balloons, which just is thrown out there and let be.But the central story, about how Shrek and Fiona struggle to overcome the odds and find true love, is really sweet and well-rendered. The animation is spectacular, a revolution for the eyes in its deep-dish panoramas and remarkable attention to textures. And the jokes keep flying, the major ones as well as hilarious bits of filigree you won't notice the first or second time but reward you for paying attention.This is not a Disney movie, something ""Shrek"" makes very clear not only with its PG-13 humor but its knocks at Disney characters like Snow White and at the Magic Kingdom in the form of Duloc, where an array of ""It's A Small World""-type dolls lecture Shrek and Donkey on all the things NOT to do. Frankly, ""Shrek"" could use a little injection of Disney heart, but Disney could use some of this picture's freshness as well. A very charming movie worth your time."

8,Shrek,8,1 October 2004,Good quality entertainment.,"I'm not one of those persons who praises ""Shrek"" all the time as one of the greatest movies ever made, like many other persons seem to do. Quite frankly I never really understood what the hype was all about. But still you have to give credit to this movie, it's very entertaining and fun to watch over and over again.A good sidekick is always important, especially in an animated movie. A good sidekick can make the movie better but a bad sidekick can really ruin a movie. ""Shrek"" doesn't have a good sidekick...it has an excellent sidekick! Donkey is a wonderful and entertaining character thanks to Eddie Murphy who voiced him. The other main voices are provided by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow.Further more I would like to add that I absolutely love the character Pinocchio in this movie.The story is told in a good way with a nice pace, I especially like how subtle some Disney movies and characters are spoofed. But for some reason I never really found the story in general that very appealing.The movie is well animated and it shows that DreamWorks is a worthy competitor for Pixar.The music is good and takes the movie to an higher level and I'm not just talking about the evergreen songs but also about the movie soundtrack by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams who know how to compose a good and fun score for animated movies.Although it's getting more credit than it really deserves, it's still a fun and entertaining animated movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
9,Shrek,7,3 July 2001,A wonderful movie,"I never set the bar too high for children or animated films because adults can never seem to get into them.  Adults go to animated films because their kids complain and fuss and drag them to see it with them.  Meanwhile, the parent is stuck there trying to watch the movie, but can't because all the children are either asleep or screaming their lungs out and the parent just wants to go see the new action flick playing right next door.  It's a waste of $7.00, I know.  However, Shrek was a real treat to go to and is meant for an older crowd.The bedtime stories our parents used to tell us as children and which we pass down to ours is retold to please a much older crowd who grew up with these stories.  It's a spoof of all the fairy tales that we all know. However, this story has a wonderful twist to it.  There's no prince charming and there's no dashing night to save the day.  Shrek is an ogar, who has to rescue the princesses so he can get back his land from the storybook characters that have overrun it.Mike Myers is witty and brilliant as the voice of Shrek.  He allows the role of Shrek to come alive.  This probably has to be one of Mike Myers' better films, and the great thing about working as a voice animator is that you don't have to spend three hours in make up and another hour or so in wardrobe.  You can just get up at six o' clock in the morning go in say your lines and get out.The other great thing about this movie is that it spoofs of such movies as the matrix and almost any fairy tale ever made.  However, it so original in plot.Eddie Murphy steals the screen as the talking donkey.  It seems everything out of his mouth gets wittier and wittier throughout the entire movie.  He brightens up the screen with a zany performance.Cameron Diaz shines as the princesses.  She enlightens us with her witty charm and surprising outbursts.   John Lithgow plays the devious prince who sends Shrek on the quest to save the princesses.  For some reason John Lithgow seems to have an amazing and talented voice.  All in all I enjoyed the film and would give it about a 7.  If you liked the movie I would suggest watching There's Something About Mary, Wayne's World, and Austin Powers."
10,Shrek,10,16 November 2005,The greatest fairy tale never told.,"Shrek is an awesome movie! Based in the ordinary fairy tales,the main thing here is to break the rules and the enchantment of those stories and show it all in a different way; Why the prince needs to be so perfect? Why the princess needs to be so beautiful?Why they need to live in a perfect castle?Why can't the royals be problematic? All of these answers are more than answered in Shrek. By the way, this is a movie with lots of humor. :)So, be prepare to laugh. (Donkey is annoying, but the biggest part of the fun comes from him!)Ps: All the cast is great as well. I already know Eddie Murphy's and Mike's(Myers)abilities as comedians,but I could never imagine that Cameron Diaz could be so perfect to do Fiona! Her voice is really cute, and I really cannot imagine a better one for Fiona ,than Cameron Diaz 's voice!"
11,Shrek,,20 May 2001,A new Green Giant for a new millenium,"Shrek (Michael Myers)  is an ogre who lives in a swamp by himself.  He wants to be by himself because he is very insecure about his looks and the way he's perceived.  Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Farquaad, many of the fairy tale characters that we all know and love including the three little pigs, the big bad wolf, fairies, the three bears and snow white are being banished. On the roster to be banished is one talking donkey by the name of....well, Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Donkey becomes a sweet and hilarious thorn in the side of Shrek.  While eating, Shrek is horrified when his swamp is disturbed by the banished fairytale creatures, at the hands of  Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Shrek learns that in order to get his swamp back, he has to talk to Lord Farquaad.   Meanwhile, Farquaad keeps one treasured fairytale item, the magic mirror from Snow White, for himself. He uses it to find himself a princess. The dialogue between he and the mirror is hilarious because it switches to an episode of the dating game with the mirror giving him three choices: Cinderella, Snow ""She lives with seven men, but she's not easy"" White  and Princess Fiona. The knights in full armor coach the prince to choose princess number three, the lovely Princess Fiona ( Cameron Diaz). Fiona is locked in a tower that is protected by a female dragon. When Shrek finally reaches the kingdom o' Farquaad, he is thrown in a WWF wrestling parody that is hilarious. Recognizing his strength, Lord Farquaad makes a deal with the ogre: get me the girl and I will give you the swamp back. Shrek accepts the deal and begins his journey with Donkey in tow.Shrek is a very clever film on many levels. It's a fairytale in every sense of the word. Listen to the way the lines are written, the way the characters speak, the way the story flows. The guys at Dream Works did a good job with this in that you could close your eyes and the dialogue flows as though you're having a story read to you. What makes this movie clever is the fact that it's a fairytale that spoofs fairytales. For example, in most fairytales, the prince is a tall, dark, handsome, kind and dashing man that isn't complete until he finds his one true love to give his heart to.  Yet Lord Farquaad is very short, sort of pale, not attractive, very evil, and lacking in the dashing department. Even his name is awkward in that he calls himself a lord when he is just a prince. In most fairytales, the princess is a beautiful, fragile, dainty and submissive young lady. That isn't the case with our Princess Fiona. She's an up front talkative young lady that kicks butt in a hilarious Matrix parody. The fairytale characters, unlike their particular stories, are at a dead end. Their stories can't end because they have no where to go.Shrek is a pure stroke of genius. It's campy for the kids and sarcastic and hilarious for the adults. It has a voice ( which a lot of movies forget to include in the recipe these days ) in that it preaches the age-old adage that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  From a technical aspect, the movie pushes the technological envelope. While watching the film and watching Shrek and the other characters move and frown, I was quickly thrown back to the time I saw Disney's Dinosaurs. You will notice a lot of the same computer animation (deep canvas) used in this movie. As for the voice-over work, the best of the best were assembled.  At first, I didn't like Mike Myers' voice or Scottish accent at all. It didn't it fit the look of the ogre that was created or the ogre we know from past fairytales. Then I realized that's what the guys at Dream Works were trying to do. They wanted an ogre that no one knew someone you would have to get to know. Once you get to know him, Shrek is very  likable.  His story is one that has the power to create sequels and spinoffs. The movie has been in the making for a long time.  It was reported that Chris Farley was originally intended to voice the  ogre. Never the less it is truly a great movie."
12,Shrek,5,12 June 2004,Wonderfully irreverent family film with lots of laughs,"The filmmakers obviously have some irreverence regarding Disney, and it's about time I say. Especially with the rather un-Disneylike behavior the studio has engaged in for the past dozen or so years. The anti Disney jokes are so much fun (our favorite is the ""small world"" parody!). I have to wonder what DULOC means! I have listened to the commentary on the DVD, done Google searches, looked through the trivia on IMDb, all to no avail. I wonder what the big secret is. Anyway, this is a family favorite of ours. The jokes may go over the heads of small children, but they will still enjoy the animation. The music is fantastic. My teenager even bought the soundtrack to it."
13,Shrek,2,4 December 2002,Lame film that depends on audience familiarity with earlier classics of the genre,"I feel like one of the few people in the world who was not impressed by SHREK.  Its characters were predictable (for an animated film made in America in 2001), its humor was of the bathroom variety, and its situations, like the one where the donkey teams up with the ogre to rescue the princess, appeared forced and contrived.  The music was good, at least.
   The worst criticism I have of the film is that it relies very heavily upon audience familiarity with the conventions in Disney films like CINDERELLA, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, and even other non-film Disney properties like Disneyland. I got bored with the movie after only 45 minutes, and decided I had better things to do with my time. 
   I much prefer a stand-alone animated comedy. ICE AGE is a good example."
14,Shrek,4,29 June 2002,Top 250?  Not hardly.  Let's have some PERSPECTIVE!,"Film was OK.  But there was ZERO acting (one of the ingredients of good film).  There was ZERO direction, the plot was stock, the talent was all in computer CGI.  Eventually we will all be replaced by computers, does that mean that art starts first?  This film does not deserve being in the top 250 films, saying otherwise does great discredit to actors, directors, and screenwriters everywhere.  It was CUTE, but let's not get carried away. Get out more and see some CINEMA, people!"
15,Shrek,4,4 March 2002,Is there a silent version ?,"Fabulous animation, but utterly destroyed for me by Murphy's incessant unfunny rantings & Myer's appalling 'Scottish' accent. So bad that I chose to watch the DVD with the French soundtrack. Myers is obviously a graduate of the van Dyke school of accents."
16,Shrek,3,13 December 2001,"Inexplicably popular, lowbrow hamimation.","Shrek is, according to the majority of the IMDB, a far better movie than Pixar's recent Monsters, Inc.Despite this, I still hold out hope for humanity. A spiritless, meagre-plotted exercise in digital imagery, ""Shrek"" makes its strength on fart jokes and a throwaway message about ""inner beauty"". The only saving grace Shrek sports is Eddie Murphy's spirited, laugh-out-loud Donkey; unless, of course, you've seen ""Mulan"", in which he made much the same appearance. Then again, I laughed at ""Mulan"" as well.Comparisons with Monsters Inc. are inevitable, but nearly impossible to make, given the drastically different drives displayed in each film. Monsters Inc., for its failings, is, like all other Pixar works, plot- and character-driven, concerning itself with a strong story first and digital spectacle second. Shrek is driven by spectacle, with the plot and character development running a distant second. All in all, not worth the $7.50 it cost to see in a theater."
17,Shrek,3,30 May 2001,how very disappointing....,"Total lack of creativity and originality causes this cartoon to fall flat, despite the strong cast doing voices. Animation was typical computer based style, nothing stellar.The story was straightforward, with no conflict, or suspense to hold interest. A very disappointing movie experience."
18,Shrek,,7 September 2007,"The story of an Ogre, a Princess and a Donkey","Everything about 'Shrek' has probably already been said but here's my little comment. 'Shrek' is definitely one of the most enjoyable flicks. There has been tremendous work put in the animation process. Yet, the makers haven't given the screenplay any less considerations and we are told a heartwarming but relevant story. Though the characters of Shrek, Fiona and Donkey are original (maybe Donkey is from the Musicians of Bremen?), we also meet various fairy tale characters spoofed into the screenplay providing us several hilarious moments.Among the voice talents, Eddie Murphy steals the show with his loud, expressive and vivacious voice. He also gets the best lines. No wonder Donkey remains the favorite character. Mike Myers is adequate. However, he doesn't seem to get the accent right all the time. Cameron Diaz is good and John Lithgow does his part very well.I consider the soundtrack a must-buy. It boasts of a compilation of famous song that fairly contribute to the screenplay as background score. The writers deserve more credit for providing those memorable hilarious moments such as Fiona singing with the bird, Donkey and Dragon's affair, the snake and frog balloons and numerous other sketches.However, on the downside, there are a few plot holes e.g. Dragon's attraction towards Donkey isn't explained and why does Lord Farquaad torture the Gingerbread man? How would the Gingerbread man know about the others? Yet, the main plot of Fiona and Shrek mostly makes up for this flaw.Without any doubt, 'Shrek' is one of the best family flicks of recent time. Kids will love the colours and the fairy tale characters and grown-ups will love the witty dialogues and intelligent humour and most would love the story."
19,Shrek,3,4 July 2005,"Cynical, hateful, topical.","While many praise ""Shrek"" as clever for adults and charming for children, keep in mind the extremely long-lasting appeal of classic animation such as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Bambi,"" ""Fantasia,"" and ""Sleeping Beauty,"" based on timeless tales and hung out to dry by this film. Those movies, did not become timeless because they were funny parodies, or had fart jokes, or projected a sarcastic yuppie outlook onto more innocent, hopeful ideals. As such, this film will be forgotten in twenty years, just like more topical children's' films from twenty or more years ago, like ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,"" ""WarGames,"" and ""Cloak and Dagger"" have been all but forgotten. Nothing this mean lasts forever."
20,Shrek,9,26 January 2005,"Beautifully computer-animated fairy tale: a gentle morality play, very skillfully done.","I'm an old dude, 75 to be exact, and in my working days I was everything from a mainframe programmer to a HiTech startup Tech Admin. This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.Now then: The movie itself is marvelous! The characters are gentle and funny; there is no gratuitous violence; there are innuendos, of course, but skillfully done in a way that the ""libretto"" if you will can be ""read"" at least two levels. The story line itself is charming, and the ending is a real, nifty surprise!I add here that I've watched this with my younger G_Kids, who loved it; and also with my bride of fifty years, who loved it.It is in all ways in a class with the best that Mr. Jobs has so far produced, which is saying a great deal.HIGHLY recommended as good, funny, charming entertainment for a whole bunch of ages.Nick Fortis Los Altos California"
21,Shrek,6,9 July 2004,Overrated but not too bad,"I really don't think much of this over-popular computerised film. It is vulgar and unfunny most of the time. But there are enough gags here to keep this film going at a steady and mildly enjoyable pace. Also, Eddie Murphey is in top form as Donkey, Mike Myers provides a passable Scottish accent for Shrek, and Cameron Diaz suits her part too. But if you are looking for good computer animation films then turn to Pixar. A thing which makes me dislike this film more is the fact that at the oscar ceremony a couple of years ago, it beat Pixar's ""Monsters, inc."" for the oscar for best animated film. ""Shrek"" isn't awful, but I get a bit bored after a while of watching a grumpy ogre farting and burping his way into the hearts of audiences around the world. 6/10"
22,Shrek,8,5 August 2006,These Animation Movies Of The 21st Century Keep Getting Better,"I enjoyed this first and second times I saw it and that was enough. By then, the second film came out and I preferred that one over this. My only complaint about this movie was Eddie Murphy's character yakking incessantly. It gets on your nerves after awhile. Give it a rest, Eddie!The rest of the characters and the film are strictly fun and combination of kids' innocence and some adult humor (which hopefully goes over the heads of kids). Mike Myers' Scottish accent on the lead character ""Shrek"" is just right. The characters mouthed by Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow did little for me. This is mainly Myers and Murphy's show.The colors in this animated film are beautiful, spectacular at times. It's just state- of-the-art artwork. The screen sometimes is filled with so many things - especially when all the fairy tale characters are pictured at once - that it's hard to focus on just one. There are lots of extras on the two-disc DVD set, too.If you liked this, check out the sequel, because it's even better."
23,Shrek,6,28 September 2008,A lovable ogre and his donkey friend steal the show...,"SHREK is probably more fun for adults than children, especially if you can recognize all the twisted elements derived from a whole flock of Disney films or Grimm's Fairy Tales.The humor is clever, although sometimes crude, and the animation has a 3D look with some very clever special effects, especially for the scene of the fire-breathing dragon chasing Shrek, the donkey and the princess across a rickety bridge over a pit of lava.The spirit of fun is more evident than ever in the Robin Hood sequence with the Merry Men bursting into song and dance.Of course, all the voices are expertly done by people like MIKE MEYERS, JOHN LITHGOW, CAMERON DIAZ and EDDIE MURPHY, none of them sounding conspicuously like their real-life selves except for Murphy.Personally, I still prefer hand drawn animation over all this computer generated stuff, so I'm not the most unbiased person to review this sort of animated film.Summing up: Funny with an odd sort of charm but terribly overrated by today's generation of moviegoers."
24,Shrek,,8 March 2004,Shrek is not just another Fairy Tale,"Shrek is an animated film that is original, funny and has an upbeat soundtrack.  The main characters are an Ogre named Shrek and a talking donkey.  Shrek (Mike Meyers) and his uninvited sidekick, donkey (Eddie Murphy) set out to rescue a princess. The princess has been locked in a castle which is guarded by a fire eating dragon.  Shrek was sent on this mission by Lord Farquaad, a very short and evil man.  Lord Farquaad is determined to become king and chose this beautiful princess to marry to achieve his goal.  Shrek agrees to rescue the princess to get his land back from the evil Lord Farquaad.  Donkey tags along because he has nowhere else to go.   Donkey has an unlikely love interest, which will play a major role at the end of the movie. Shrek holds our attention even if the plot sounds old.  Once the princess is rescued, the movie plot changes from a standard fairy tale to a whole new idea.  On the way back to Lord Farquaad's castle, donkey discovers an unsettling secret about the princess and promises not to tell.  Of course, the princess falls in love with Shrek, but that is not the secret. The princess's secret is the moral of the story and makes a good ending.Shrek is an enjoyable movie.  It has adult humor, but don't worry, young kids will not understand it.  The one liners are very funny.  The music is great.  The characters are unique and fun to watch.    Don't leave the movie before the credits roll, the fairy tale characters do an excellent version of an old Monkee's song."
25,Shrek,3,24 May 2001,passionless pastiche of pop-culture,"I did laugh several times during the movie. Yet some of the times I did, I could at the same time not suppress a feeling of uneasiness on account of the children sitting (and laughing) behind me. The jokes I am talking about were bordering on tastelessness and morbidity. Wiping one's behind  seems to be a major motif in the movie, but that should perhaps be expected from Myers (whom I do enjoy in films designed for a mature audience). Yet exploding birds and inflated frogs are something I do not want my eventual children to see. Certainly the tips-of-the-hat, as for example to every fairy-tale I have ever heard, are funny, but that is all that the film consists of. There is no originality, all is a spin-off or spoof. The dialogues between the donkey and Shrek are funny if you are five years old and haven't seen Mulan (there Eddie Murphy lends his voice to the same side-kick character, the little dragon, where his now cliche joke slang had far more intelligence and originality), Aladdin or Hercules. Same old jokes, and even triter for the repetition. The only times I laughed were the above mentioned instances of risque tastelessness a la There's Something About Mary; I am not contradicting myself here, all I said was that they are absolutely unfit for an audience of children. Shrek is certainly a mirror unto our American Culture. Pro-wrestling, hip-hop slang and Myers' fake British accent a la mode, theme park parking lots and pop songs. All that assembled in a better-than-life digital pastiche, voila. More money for DreamWorks. They have the technology but lack the creativity. They have the precision but lack all passion. I felt curiously empty after the movie. And since when are the voices behind the animations so important that their names are all you see on the movie posters?"
26,Shrek,2,21 October 2001,"It's not just bitter, retaliatory spite - it's CLUMSY, bitter, retaliatory spite","I can't BELIEVE that this could even be MISTAKEN for good animation.  When I saw the trailer I squirmed in my seat, deeply embarrassed on the animators' behalf.  Could they have got at least SOMETHING right?  Could they have moved at least SOMETHING in a passably convincing fashion?The answer is a deafening no.  The animation is even worse than the cleverly edited trailer let on.  The king's subjects move like mannequins with performers standing behind them, jerking the limbs - which may be fair enough, given PDI's evident shortage of skilled character animators, but when one of the central characters (Princess Fiona) moves in the same fashion, it's time to throw up one's hands in despair.  (Shrek and the Donkey are the best animated of the lot, but even they twitch their facial muscles like people pulling expressions out of a catalogue, even they gesture as though they're posing for photographs, and even they run as though they're trying not to get anywhere.)So how DID this come to be mistaken for good animation?  I think - but this is just a guess - that the public looks for two things in an animated film: glossiness, and frame-by-frame detail.  All the surfaces in Shrek are finely detailed (in an ugly, repetitive, phoney kind of way), and the garishly clashing colours have all been brightly polished and coated with a hideously artificial plastic varnish ... and this, thinks the man in the street, must be what ""good animation"" is.  Rubbish.  Good animation involves convincing, expressive MOVEMENT, which makes ""Shrek"" the most thoroughly shoddy of the six (or seven, depending on how you count) computer-animated films that have so far been released.  Even apart from the poor animation the art direction is terrible.  Surfaces clash, colours clash, designs and styles and backgrounds clash.  Comic and dramatic timing is off.  And as if all this weren't bad enough, every single thing the animators have placed before our eyes is just god-damned UGLY.  It hurts to look at.  It really hurts.Not that the best art direction in the world could rescue this childish, spiteful, self-consciously flippant story.  Ten years ago the unexpected animated success of the year was ""Beauty and the Beast""; the animated smash hit ten years later is but a shallow mockery of Beauty-and-the-Beast folktales, complete with fart jokes, and the kind of plot complications one normally sees in Sherwood Schwartz sitcoms.  What kind of pea-brained senses of humour do they think we have?  (Hey, listen - they're playing modern rock songs, in a medieval fairytale.  Ha ha, an anachronism!)  I feel as though I've just been harangued by a comedian who thinks his jokes will become funny if he shouts them loud enough.  In reality I was haranged by two such comedians.  One is Mike Myers, who almost manages to pull off the gruff Scottish accent he's trying for; the other is Eddie Murphy, who seems to be under the delusion that the vocal performance he gave in ""Mulan"" will be just as funny a second time.  It was only funny the first time because Disney's animators were able to supply the humour.  The PDI animators aren't.The sad thing is we've voted for this kind of loud, vulgar rubbish with our wallets, and now we're going to get more and still more of it until one of us, and it will probably be me, goes insane.  Do you realise that ""Shrek"" is so far the biggest box office smash of the twenty-first century, and that it could very well KEEP that title - forever?  It's a depressing thought."
27,Shrek,1,13 August 2001,Did I miss something in viewing Shrek,"There was little to no story, and what was presented as a story in the advertisements was done away with at the very begining of the film, I doubt that Shrek will hold this high of a rating for a long time (look how fast it took Phantom Menace to fall down the charts).  In terms of animation it looked nice, but sheesh this movie was just another excuse to take cheap shots at Disney, and while most Disney animated films have morals, there was no redeeming value in this movie at all. The moral of the story was what? its okay to be ugly just not short? The characters were all pretty much annoying, and at the end of the movie which was where the Princess transforms its pretty predictable as I was thinking to myself as the smoke covered her body (okay so she's gonna change into a Ogre I'm wayy Ahead of you guys) its a direct cop out of a the Beauty and the Beast story we all know. I think it would have been a heck of alot better had she transformed into her female human self, and fell in love with the Ogre, at least that way it would have presented a message. Only message I found here is Peter Kratzenberg hates disney and well he can SUCK MY tape of Toy Story a film that still exceeds every 3d animated film ever made."
28,Shrek,4,3 September 2005,Huge disappointment,"After reading so many positive reviews I was really looking forward to this movie which I expected to be clever and satirical. Instead, I saw a coarse, vulgar and essentially mean-spirited send up of Disney-style animated fairy tales wholly lacking in originality. Endless fart and gross out humor, obvious references to other movies (hey guys -- just because you can reference a Hidden Dragon fight sequence doesn't make your movie interesting or funny), a predictable plot, and the self-contradiction of the theme (we're all beautiful) with the attacks on the short and the fat(all short people are Napoleon wannabees, the Princes is ugly when she's fat), overwhelm the few good lines in the movie. Plus, the animation is terrible; I've no doubt that it's technically excellent but artistically it looks blocky and low budget. If you're thinking of renting this for the kids, it's too crude. And for yourself, too stupid."
29,Shrek,1,15 February 2002,The worst animated feature I have ever seen.,"I had to force myself to sit through this drivel. My grandchildren all left before it was over. Does not compare with the delightful ""Monsters Incorporated"" that appeared later in the year. I have no idea how anyone could even consider this thing for any nomination other than ""turkey of the year."""
30,Shrek,1,11 August 2004,green,"Is it just me, but does this DreamWorks PIXAR-Rip Off sort of remind you of the whore of babylon? Not a good enough analogy? Okay, I'll expound upon my biliious hatred for this movie. First, a brief tangent about the acting in this film and how it relates to the degradation of the acting craft. Mike Myers is not funny. Cameron Diaz is not funny. One of them is sexy. 'Nuff said. I'll keep this short and sweet. I have an amazing sense of humor. I did not laugh at anything in this movie. It's not funny. It's too sophomoric to even be a children's film. What is the point of parodying the world of Happily Ever Afters? Well, it's an excuse to utilize the Pixar formula (which, as I mentioned in my Finding Nemo review, is creating an anthropomorphic microsociety or microcosm in an inanimate world.) Because clearly there's nothing funnier than the prospect of a whole Faery tale world, right? Where all the retired characters hang out? You know, because this isn't identical to Toon Town from Who Framed Roger Rabbit in every way imaginable, is it? Wait. Yes it is. Perhaps it behooves me to annote that i micturated my pants at the advent of this film. Goodmorning and g'night."
31,Shrek,1,20 September 2002,Not sure what the big deal is...,"I watched this movie with high expectations after hearing so many great things about it. I had seen Monsters Inc and people swore this movie was ten times better. I was quite excited to see it and what did I get, two hours of Mike Myers doing the ""Fat Bastard"" voice from Austin Powers, Eddie Murphy making lame jokes and a story so bad it was laughable. The animation was not as impressive as had been talked about and I found myself just wishing the movie would end. John Lithgow was the only redeeming part of the film."
32,Shrek,1,30 March 2002,not very good,"I know that a lot of people seemed to like this movie, but I thought it was very poor.  The jokes were old and crass, and I couldn't laugh if I tried.  The story line was dumb, and the ending even worse.  By far, in my opinion, Monsters Inc. was much much better."
33,Shrek,,19 May 2001,The First Disney Hate Film,"Spoilers herein.Why was this film made? To humble Disney/Pixar -- and it shows in the deeply self-referential story.The villain is the dwarf Eisner. His kingdom is Disneyland, newly berift of the legacy characters. And he dearly needs to be king, but won't be.Strangely, for his first truly big battle with Disney, Katzenberg copies `Beauty and the Beast,' in all important particulars. So in addition to being a film whose story is about itself, it is a film which battles itself.With all this baggage, it was likely to fail, and it does. Compare this to the recent `Spy Kids,' to see better imagination, better charm, better pacing."
34,Shrek,1,27 June 2001,A Big Thumbs Down,"What a waste of time and money! I never laughed once during this dismal attempt at making a fairy-tale with a ""meaningful"" message. Mike Myers obviously wanted to share his gross-out, Austin Powers-style comedy with the younger generation,adding some adult innuendo to keep the parents titillated.The film's animation, while technically superior, is cold and unappealing.Unfortunately, the voice actors provide little entertainment, especially Eddie Murphy in his ""stock"" loudmouth idiot role. A enormous cast of animated creatures, and a fantasy landscape do not compensate for the lack of soul in this anti-Disney tirade from a disgruntled ex-employee.I spent the first half-hour waiting for the funny part, and the rest of the film waiting to leave the theater. If I had it to do over, I would have walked out sooner.In a movie that supposedly (although in a satirical way) has a message of tolerance, there are too many familiar stereotypes and cruel jokes spread around.I'm not surprised that Shrek has enjoyed a wide audience. It is the same drivel that passes for comedy in many films these days, notably, There's Something AboutMary, American Pie, Dumb and Dumber, the Ace Ventura movies, and anything from Mike Myers.  Juvenile bathroom humor is the lowest form of comedy, and is meant to appeal to the whiny adolescent in all of us. What a shame studios are producing films that demand the viewer be brain-dead.Rating: One star out of 10."
35,Shrek,2,21 March 2006,Yuck.,"I can't really believe that this movie won Best Animated Deature over ""Monsters, Inc."" I have not seen a movie that is so bizarre and stupid as this one. They make fun of Disney by putting Disney characters in the movie, such as Pinocchio, the three little pigs, the big bad wolf, the seven Dwarfs, and so on. I don't like movies that make fun of other companies who spend many man hours making good movies. Shrek was not the best movie I have ever seen. I can't say, however, that there aren't any funny parts. I think that ""Donkey"" should be given an actual name. He is really annoying, that's really what makes this movie not worth watching.My Score: 2/10."
36,Shrek,7,30 April 2005,Has hidden messages,"Shrek has hidden messages that will likely sail right over the heads of its target audience. The resettlement of the fairly tale creatures in the villainous Farquaad's (ruthless and cruel Anglo-Saxon) kingdom is an allusion to the resettlement of Jews in ghettos carried out by many European principalities during the Middle Ages (at the time of Martin Luther, I think they were expelled from England, France and Spain but tolerated, with restrictions, in some German city states). The filmmakers seem to be suggesting that just as Farquaad did not appreciate the fairy tale creatures and their magical and unique abilities and may have in fact been afraid of them, so, too, were Europeans afraid of Jews and their foreign culture and thus unjustly persecuted them. Apparently, all for no good reason. Shrek, the ogre, of course, represents how the African would have been received in medieval European society. He is feared and misunderstood as a stupid, grotesque, and violent menace. Of course, we are shown that in his private moments, he is anything but these undesirable qualities and his moral fibre transcends his physical ugliness. The fact that the fair princess Fiona is revealed to really be an ogress is to confirm that well worn cliché that we are all the same inside. In a classic fairy tale, which Shrek is the antithesis of, written by someone like Hans Christian Anderson for instance, Farquaad would be the hero, Shrek the villain, and Fiona would indeed be the fairest maiden in all the land."
37,Shrek,8,15 September 2003,"Not perfect, but quite good and hilarious quite often.","This most assuredly is not a perfect film, but it is a marvelous send-up of the fairy-tale genre and the script is great.  This has romance, humor, a talking donkey, no car chases and makes fun of The Mouse.  What more could you ask for?  Movie spoofs and karaoke?  It has those too.  Most harrowing performance by gingerbread?  You betcha!  The voicework is spot on and even Eddie Murphy is enjoyable.  Great fun is had by all (except Michael Eisner-I'd love to have been a fly on the wall in Eisner's office the morning after this copped the Oscar for Animated Feature).  Very entertaining and well worth your time.  Most recommended."
38,Shrek,2,2 December 2002,Missing Something?,"My one line summary above can be taken in two different ways.  First, it could be seen as asking, ""Is this movie missing something?""  Or, it could also be taken to mean, ""Am I missing something?""  I'll try to answer it both ways.First of all, let me tell you that I grew up on cartoons.  I loved them back when I was a kid and I probably love them even more now.  This ""Shrek"" dreck, on the other hand, shouldn't really be classified as a cartoon. Sure, it's animated.  Sure, it isn't live action.  But it is to cartoons what digital video (i.e. ""Attack of the Clones"") is to film.  And I don't like that.So it's a light-hearted comedy with a great message.  Right?  Everybody I talked to that had seen this movie told me it was great, both for the parents and the kids.  I'm neither, but I can appreciate good humor in any form.  This movie just plain didn't make me laugh.  It didn't make me laugh; it didn't make me think; it didn't make me happy; and it certainly didn't make me glad I spent the time watching it.Therefore, on all counts, this movie is a complete failure.  It's my belief it's missing something (a soul perhaps?); however, it could be that it's just me who, plain and simple, does not ""get it."""
39,Shrek,2,22 October 2002,"Vindictive, Tasteless, Charmless - A truly awful movie.","Just three of the words I could use to describe this anti-cute, anti-Disney movie. I can only remember laughing once. Most of the time I was horrified. I didn't appreciate some of my favourite animations being slandered. None of the characters appealed and there was nothing outstanding about the artwork. My favourite CGI film is Ice Age which is the complete opposite of this. It has plenty of charm, humour, great characters & some of the best animated sequences ever. I'll take cuteness over cynicism any day. 2/10"
40,Shrek,2,15 July 2002,mind-numbing,"Now, I realize that a lot of people really enjoyed this movie. I can't honestly say it was the WORST film ever made...But I think all the hype surrounding it actually may have given it some unattainable goals.First off...It was ugly. Plain and simple. Some of the scenery was pretty, but the characters looked like regular, saturday morning-style animation, just using CGI. I won't even ATTEMPT to compare it to Monsters Inc., or Toy Story.And to some people, it may have been funny. But I tire of ""butt"" and ""fart"" jokes pretty quickly. And by the end of the film I was ready to jam pencils into my eardrums, simply to escape that donkeys constant babbling. It felt like a chore to have to finish it.If you are ready for a mediocre film, with immature humour, and an incredibly irritating donkey, Shrek is it."
41,Shrek,1,9 November 2005,I Despise This Film,I hate this piece of garbage film. Absolutely hate it. This give comedy a bad name. I can't take anybody anymore. Everybody loves it and everybody wants to watch it over and over again because they say they never get bored of it. This movie was corny and disgusting. Mike Myers has got to be one of thee worst comedians of all time. He has never appeared in a movie that I don't hate. He is just so irritating. I used to like Eddie Murphy back in the eighties when he was talented but he ruined his reputation with some of his later movies. I was so angry when they came out with Shrek 2 and now I found out there making a third. What the Hell? Kill this stupid irritating movie.
42,Shrek,1,24 December 2001,Dreck.,"Bad animation, only okay (voice)acting and a so-so story does not a great movie make. I just can't fathom the response to this movie. Somehow Shrek has the reputation of being a great parody--it isn't. The great parodies (e.g. Blazing Saddles, South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut) rise above the material they are parodying--Shrek doesn't come close to equaling the Disney material it makes fun of.Monsters, Inc. ran circles around Shrek in all three categories--yet Shrek is the favorite to win the new animation Oscar. Ah well."
43,Shrek,2,26 June 2006,It was... okay.,"It was sorta good when I saw it the first time, but after that it was BORING !!Some of the jokes were a bit funny but some were a bit childish and obvious, like when Shrek goes ""It's quiet, Too quiet"". The plot was a bit too ""Fairytale"" like for me.The actors were a good choice and the music was good, but the story was a bit of a let down for me, after hearing so much about it. I guess after seeing it three times, it has to be a bit boring.I know that a lot of people seemed to like this movie, but I thought it was very stupid.I didn't laugh throughout the whole movie. Monsters Inc. was way better than this ! You decide for yourself !"
44,Shrek,8,13 February 2005,"""Do you know... the muffin man?""","The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say ""that does not look right."" There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike."
45,Shrek,3,27 June 2002,Very Unoriginal,"My wife and I recently rented this movie on DVD and it was our first viewing.  Let me say that I went into this with low expectations, which set me up to be pleasantly surprised.But that didn't happen.  This movie is very unoriginal.  The jokes are almost entirely tired, worn out ones that we've all heard many times before. How many times do they (hollywood) expect us to laugh at passing gas? That joke got tired when I was like 16.The characters are equally unoriginal.  When the donkey opened his mouth, I thought, ""Eddie Murphy as the 'colorful' little sidekick?""  Mulan pretty much used up the quota on that one.  At least in Mulan he got to say some funny lines.At times, I felt like I wasn't watching a movie.  It's almost like a set of animated, disconnected music videos.  Anyway, there's very little wit on display and the characters are not at all endearing to the audience.  You can tell that the writers are trying too hard.  They just don't have it."
46,Shrek,4,7 March 2002,Another example of the masses settling for less. . .,"For anyone who A) believes that Shrek actually deserves an Academy Award nomination, and wasn't celebrated as such as a result of studio politics in a year where three huge entertainment conglomerates happened to release big-budget computer animation films (Disney, Paramount, Dreamworks) or B)that the movie was actually any good, please examine the following:Shrek pales in comparison to Pixar's Monster's Inc., and for very obvious reasons. Shrek desperately relies wholesale on it's (beware of the following buzzwords) ""cheeky/sarcastic/irreverent/ironic/tongue-in-cheek/post-modern"" send ups of classic fairy tales and folklore and . . . . not much else. I mean, it surely isn't relying on the completely NON-EXISTENT chemistry between Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Shrek is Eddie Murphy's most UN-funny performance since Vampire In Brooklyn; and Mr. Myers starting getting truly & incorrigibly irritating by the time the first Austin Powers hit video. His disappearance from America's pop culture radar is long overdue.The story: Monsters, Inc. - like each and every one of the very excellent Pixar films - has heart and a warmth that cleverly (and NOT insultingly) touches every generation of viewers. Monsters, Inc. is able to speak to the audience in very touching and enjoyable ways, much like Toy Story 2; adults can remember/enjoy/get teary-eyed over their childhoods in a very sweet way, while enjoying seeing the joy and glee in their own kids' eyes while being entertained by the very excellent John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi (see some other long-winded Monsters, Inc. reviewer for story/plot details). What do we get from Shrek? A dragon that falls in love with the donkey - not for sincere emotional effect, but for dumb sexual comedy. Shrek is empty, hollow and cad-ish in comparison, without a single level of emotional resonance; Monsters, Inc. achieves several, handily.The comedy: The performance of a comedy team like Goodman & Crystal speaks for itself compared to the forced, joyless interaction between Myers' unlikeable Shrek and Murphy's neutered donkey. Goodman and Crystal - probably by virtue of Crystal's deep comedy roots & Borscht Belt classicism - touch on hammy old humor, updated and ""modern"" laughs and the good old goofy stuff for the wee ones. In fact, Monsters, Inc. struck me immediately as one of the least gag-oriented Pixar flicks - a lesser writing/producing team (ahem, Dreamworks) would rely on nothing but predictable monster gags in the same context. Don't believe me? Save for the Gingerbread Man scene, Shrek's ""clever"" gags are tired, overdone versions of the kinds of things we *really* laughed with in greats like Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the shorts of Chuck Jones & Tex Avery. The animation & cartoon industry has been lampooning themselves (and related genres like fairy tales, comic books, etc.) with good humor since the 1930s - do we need Shrek to do this for us again, now?The animation: It's impossible to not touch on this: Shrek's design is about as likeable & attractive as that of Antz, Dreamworks' other totally missed-the-mark and, well, ugly animated film. No one took any creative liberties with the environment and setting - we get an anonymous forest, a castle, a countryside. Wow. The setting of Monsters, Inc. is a visual carnival of original ideas and imaginative film making. Taking it's cues from existing influences and bettering them, or at the very least making them dazzle on their own, is half the reason animation exists - did YOU get that from the generic look and feel of Shrek?I will be thrilled - and honestly shocked - if the ""voters"" choose Monsters, Inc. over the huge-selling and grossly overrated Shrek. I've been conditioned to expect so little from fellow movie goers (see: Snatch and A Beautiful Mind's inexplicable presence in the IMDB.com Top 250) that I totally expect the more inferior film to get the award (notice, if you will, that I'm not even entertaining the thought of throwing Jimmy Neutron into this discussion - although, a comparison between Neutron and Shrek is probably more appropriate; it's easier to sort the trash that way, isn't it?)."
47,Shrek,3,12 January 2002,YAWN,Overrated. I've tried watching this movie on three separate occasions and fell asleep each time. Not funny quite a bore. Sorry is not catching and not appealing. Characters lack memorable characteristics and don't strike accord with me. Try Monsters Inc.... Now THAT'S a good movie!!
48,Shrek,4,30 May 2001,I didn't laugh-out-loud once!,"I was really looking forward to this movie! I'm a huge fan of Mike Myers' I think he's one of the funniest people around at the moment and I always enjoy his work. I've also enjoyed the other actors/actresses previous work - Murphy, Diaz and Lithgow. I was prepared to really love this film. I'm really upset that I didn't...From the moment the opening credits blasted up, with Smash Mouths ""All Star"" screaming over the top of the animation I knew there was something wrong. The rest of the audience was in hysterics - one guy laughing distracting loud. But I just didn't think an ogre washing himself with mud was *that* funny. The rest of the humour was unfortunately the same. I don't mind the kind of humour in Shrek when used in small doses - but I need some subtle humour as well. Everything was so in your face LAUGH, LAUGH, LAUGH we *really* want you to laugh. Look, we're doing a parody of Robin Hood and now we're copying that scene from The Matrix. Well, ha-de-ha ha! Haven't we seen the effects used in The Matrix spoofed in enough films for one lifetime? Obviously not 85% of the audience laughed their heads of - I didn't.It's obvious from the other reviews that I'm not in the majority as far as opinions on this film go. I'm prepared to say chances are if you're reading this you'll enjoy the film. But I didn't and others didn't - as with all movies sometimes the *charm* is just lost on some of us. Don't let the overly positive reviews here have you entering the theatre thinking nothing can possibly go wrong. Loving this movie is not by any means a certainty - don't expect to fall in love with the movie - I did and was bitterly disappointed.Do you like humour so obvious it leaps out of the screen and slaps you in the face? I'm sure half of the cinema laughed because they felt they had to. Some of the laughter sounded really phony.So do I have anything good to say about this movie? Well, yes I do. The animation was excellent - the animators did a great job. The actors' who were cast were perfect for their roles! The storyline was good and I enjoyed following it - it just wasn't funny! I smirked at a few things but as I said I didn't laugh out loud once.4/10 for effects and casting!"
49,Shrek,4,24 January 2007,Smarmy medieval animated comedy built around modern references...,"Cynical, smart-ass computer-animated comedy from DreamWorks begins with green medieval ogre Shrek reading a fairy tale in an outhouse... Later, after reluctantly falling for a princess who suffers under a curse, he attempts to be a local hero by returning the girl to her father and regaining his swamp land. Gross-out humor (for the 12-&-under crowd) permeates this in-jokey venture, which is further undermined by misplaced rock songs on the soundtrack and too-familiar star-voices for the characters (mostly sounding annoying and hammy). For many adults, the obvious references, easy-target humor and to-the-rafters slapstick seemed to suffice, yet the picture is awfully crude. Based on the book by William Steig, it was of course hugely popular at the box-office and spawned two sequels (so far). ** from ****"
50,Shrek,8,8 October 2006,A Dream World by DreamWorks,"Shrek is a sprawling surge into fairytale archetypes and stereotypes  the ogre, the noble steed, the damsel in distress, the evil lord, a fire-breathing dragon, Pinnochio, the three little pigs, the medieval tournaments and the festering forest swamp  it indulges and loses itself in the fun of these staples and it makes no pretense about it. The creators at DreamWorks Studios brush up on an old fairytale premise of a hero saving the damsel in distress from the dragon's keep with intelligent, deft strokes. The result is a meticulously animated, hilarious, heartwarming fluff of a film.The film's most prominent weapon in its arsenal is humour that takes the form of biting, comical, and even brilliant satire. Nearly every scene is peppered with pop-culture references, spoofs and homages  as has become DreamWorks' trademark of sorts  yet not quite as many of them as in Shrek II. Although it is an evenly enjoyable experience, a handful of scenes truly jump out and grab you. The brilliant rapport between the Gingerbread Man ""Gingie"" and the evil Lord Farquaad (voiced by funnyman John Lithgow) makes itself known at the beginning of the film in the interrogation room. The morbid lord has torn off Gingie's legs and is now toying with them: ""Run, run, run as fast as you can. You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!"", his wicked veneer transforming into a twisted, sadistic smile, to which Gingie boldly exclaims: ""Eat me!""Shrek, Donkey and Fiona are nevertheless the most thoroughly likable characters and they are given the most screen time in the film. The two former are an unlikely pair: an anti-social, misunderstood green ogre and a clingy, annoying, talking donkey. They reluctantly set out to accomplish a mission for Lord Farquaad  to bring home princess Fiona  but end up with more than they bargained for. It is this genius triumvirate of animated persons that take the front row in DreamWorks' Shrek; they are its goldmine, its heart, its soul and its most blatant source of comedy. It is however easy to see how the film's glorious, meticulous and aesthetically intoxicating setting could overshadow even its protagonist Shrek, yet this aspect is always firmly placed in the backseat of the story. Substance over style, in other words, but rest assured that animated visuals will not get much more striking than this.I am in fact pressed to find an aspect of the film that was noticeably sub-par. Everything truly is wonderfully created. From the crisp animation to the YMCA/Michael Flatley/Robin Hood spoofs to the rapid-fire pop-culture references to the deadpan deliveries to heartfelt story, all is well-sewn together in the story. Even the mandatory sing-and-dancer number at the end purposely avoids a cheesy approach (unlike Shrek II). I suppose, if anything  it is somewhat heavy on the 'message & moral' side of things and toward the end it often tips over into corny lessons.8 out of 10"
51,Shrek,8,5 June 2004,Watched this again today - it's still fantastic!,"I saw this movie when it originally came out at the cinema, and I thought it was one of the best animated movies ever done - a great comedy too.
Anyway, I have not seen Shrek 2 yet, but since my mother has decided she wants to see it too we watched the first Shrek today, as she had never seen that particular film.It is probably one of the funniest movies I have seen in the last 5 years or so - animated or live action. The humour appeals on so many levels - the kids watching get all the fairy tale jokes and so do the adults, and then there are a lot of one liners, especially from Eddie Murphy's Donkey character and from Mike Myers as Shrek, which only the adults in the audience truly get.And the story is really good too - there is a moral point in there that all the kids I know really got, and one boy (who is facially disfigured himself), said it was nice to see that even though she an ogre still at the end, Shrek loved her anyway and still thought she was beautiful - if only life was like that all the time!Shrek is a film that both adults and children will want to watch over and over again and it deserves to have made the millions it did for all involved.I rated this film as a 10 because it is a great movie, if I gave it less that would be saying there was something slightly wrong with it, but really I couldn't fault it.A great movie experience for all the family!"
52,Shrek,1,27 December 2004,Completely inappropriate for children,"Some acquaintances bought this on DVD for their young children (who have watched it numerous times). I forced myself to watch it with them one evening to see what kind of messages were being drummed into their little heads.It was as I expected: more crude, unfunny garbage from the decadent and perverted minds in Hollywood. While lowbrow adults may find this foul cartoon amusing, it is definitely inappropriate for adolescent children. Contains the numerous sexual references and not-so-subtle homosexual innuendo that's now become so typical in this genre of adult ""humor"" and Liberal doctrine targeted at children.If you love your children, you will not allow them to watch this animated offal."
53,Shrek,1,9 September 2001,toilet humor,"Lots of toilet humor, sexual innuendo, et cetera. Not sure why they do this stuff. Do they feel like adults won't bring their children to movies if this kind of thing is not there? I brought my 3 year old to this movie and sort of regret doing it.I guess the PG rating should have been a bit of a clue what was in the works."
54,Shrek,2,28 December 2001,Shrek was very overrated.,"How could so many of the nation's critics be hoodwinked by ""Shrek"" and not see it for what it really was - a dumbed down, tiresome and thematically inconsistent bore.  First of all, this film panders to the lowest common denominator with the usage of a ""hip"" pop soundtrack and stereotyped characters.  I'm referring specifically to Eddie Murphy's step-and-fetch-it donkey role, the viewing of which should have caused riots at the NAACP, but didn't.  It is the most hideously and offensively stereotyped character in recent memory.  Furthermore, this film was dull and lifeless.  It relied so much on reference after reference to Disney films that I came to wonder when the references would cease and when the actual movie was going to begin. And because film critics routinely turn off their brains during animated films, they didn't notice the glaring thematic contradiction in ""Shrek."" The overall message of the film is that appearance doesn't matter, and yet the filmmakers have no qualms with making fun of the small stature of the Prince character.  I was really disappointed with ""Shrek"" - so much so that I actually fell asleep while watching it."
55,Shrek,,18 December 2001,Plenty for kids and adults alike,"An ogre lives happily in his swamp before he is invaded by a horde of other fairy tale characters fleeing persecution from the evil Lord Farquaad.  In order to clear his swamp of the squatters, Shrek agrees to undergo a quest to rescue a Princess from a dragon and bring her to Farquaad's castle. However on the journey back Shrek and Princess Fiona being to become friends, but can a Princess love an ogre?This is one of the best animated films that I've ever been able to see.  Not only is it really funny but the story is great - it's deep if you want it to be deep, but there's plenty on the surface if you just want that.  The whole thing about true love and love finding it's true form is very moving, and the characters are developed to the extent that you fully believe them (despite them being donkeys, ogres and mini-tyrants!).  In terms of comedy I expected more - but only because I thought it was a spoof film rather than a well plotted fairy tale.  However many bits are really funny, Murphy's Donkey gets the most laughs, but there are plenty of other great scenes that range from adult laughs to people falling down for the kids - the gingerbread man scene being my favourite (""the muffin man?"").Like Toy Story this succeeds by having a great story, great characters and a huge number of jokes for adults that are a) clever, b) funny and c) not forced in the least.  This mix makes for a wonderful film.  Mike Myers is great as Shrek - he gets very few jokes, I assumed that he would ham it up, but he plays the sensitive role very well and carries the emotional core of the film.  Murphy is brilliant as the donkey, gets all the best lines and is the best animated character - it's his role to carry the bulk of the comedy. Lithgow is great as Farquaad and the animation just reflects him perfectly. Diaz is OK as Fiona but at times her vocal abilities aren't good enough to bring the character to life.  This is especially evident during Fiona's transformation where the role needed a lot more emotion to win us over.Overall a wonderful film - there aren't many films that can combine great comedy, strong characters, moving and meaningful story and be original and inventive.  To find all these things in a cartoon makes for a great 90 minutes."
56,Shrek,1,17 March 2002,Rude and crude!,"I really didn't enjoy shrek at all! It was humorus at times, but horribly crude at others. I also found the animation to be a bit overdone and the characters quite annoying. The only enjoyable one was that poor unfortunate gingerbread man. I give it a 1/10!"
57,Shrek,10,16 November 2004,"One Delightful, Fruitful ""Fairy Tale""","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Shrek"" succeeds as a unique, intelligent, and delightful spin on the general Disney-dominated fairy tale genre. It is simplistic, satiric, and unapologetic in its marvelously clever deviation from what has been historically perceived as the general fresh, moral-promoting, sensational fantasy genre, and as a matter of fact, it makes no compromises in deploring Disney's notorious masterpieces! Featuring a reclusive, abhorrent ogre as the protagonist is daring and unorthodox enough, yet also include the likes of an obnoxious, yet amicable chatterbox donkey (Eddie Murphy) as his ""unwanted sidekick"", an ungrateful (and quite peculiar) princess as the subject of the heroic quest, and a lamentable, unintimidating midget named Lord Farquad as the villain, ""Shrek"" is not your typical innocent family fare, and it deserves high accolades for breaching the boundaries of what is traditionally accepted of the fantasy genre, and achieving an unconventional, dynamic, and truly amazing work of entertainment. To begin with, the title character Shrek is absolutely hilarious: a low-brow, anti-social ""hideous creature"" who resides in a filthy swamp, consumes worms, and justifies his personality in descrying: ""Ogres are like onions, because they have lairs"". Just about every line that is uttered by this whimsical, yet loathsome, Shrek, is entirely laughable, and it is very difficult to actually take him seriously, even during frequent areas of sentimentality and self-reflection. Eddie Murphy provides his raw energy and vocalism in playing Shrek's opposite, the donkey, who is at times irksome with his incessant babblings, yet at times provides a welcome balance to Shrek's weaker parts. The screenplay is very engaging, extremely clever, and often hilarious. Besides the delightful dialogue between Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona, and Lord Farquad, there are some very daring and innovative ""pokes"" which deserve much commendation. The silliness of the gingerbread man pleading desperately not to pluck his gumdrop buttons is timeless! The Snow White ""mirror, mirror, what will it be? Princess 1, 2, or 3?""--- how classically contemporary! And Shrek awaking ""Sleeping Beauty"" perfunctorily and unconventionally--- hilarious! There are some really imaginative qualities to be applauded here: the animation settings are a mix between notorious fairy tale scenes, yet full of modern characters and dialogue that would appall anyone really living in those times! The cheerful, melodic music brilliantly collaborates with the mostly amusing, sometimes sentimental atmosphere of the film, and reminds us that every scene in the film plays a purpose to the story that is trying to be told. This is definitely one of the most enjoyable and satisfying animated films I have ever seen, is quite superior to its successor ""Shrek 2"", and as a piece of entertainment, it works extremely effectively in achieving the humor, structure, character, catharsis, and meaning that is so often desired in movies, and is extremely rare as far as innocent animated fairy tales come. ""Shrek"" is one jolly, fruitful green ogre to behold! **** out of ****"
58,Shrek,1,12 June 2002,AAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. There, I said it. I don't know why exactly I hate it so much. I like to think it's because after being hyped up for so long from across the pond, in the newspapers, on TV, crisp packets, toilet rolls etc, it turned out to be the unfunniest thing since impotence. IT IS DIRE. I never laughed once, and my skin hurt from the amount of cringing I was doing. John Lasseter and his Pixar team must have watched this film open-mouthed in horror as Shrek was uttered in the same sentence as Toy Story. I know I did. Shrek is lame in every respect, be it the obvious gags that I could see coming from across the horizon, Mike Myers' half-Scottish/half-something accent or the flat, lifeless, rendered-in-a-hurry graphics that Pixar wouldn't use on their mobile phones. It's difficult to understand how anyone could enjoy this tripe, and don't get me started on the recent Oscar victory... Excuses may be made, but I don't think that there's a valid one for sloppy scriptwriting and half-baked animation being bulked up with a few celebrities and a LOT of money. Kids like it: do they? Kids like lots of things, including bullying, picking their noses and soiling their underwear, so that doesn't make this a good film. And it did well at the box-office, which means it must be good: a third of the world is Communist - that doesn't make them right though, does it?..."
59,Shrek,9,4 December 2005,Fairy tales will never be the same again...,"Four years on, Shrek still is a brilliant, original, charming and very funny animated feature. Subverting the usual fairy tale concepts, it's a milestone in ""adult"" animation, thanks to its intelligent plot, awesome characters and great movie references, especially the VERY subtle jokes about Disney films.The movie is a perfect mix of satire, action, comedy and romance that keeps delighting the audience even after the, say, twenty-fifth viewing. A lot of its charm is linked to the politically incorrect story and characters, which are voiced by some amazing people: Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and, most of all, Eddie Murphy are the perfect vocal choices for the titular ogre, princess Fiona and Donkey, who is one of the best sidekicks (not just animated) in movie history, the motormouth animal having the same appeal and comic potential as Aladdin's Genie. This is one of those movies where you can say:""Eddie Murphy is a gas"". And the supporting creatures are incredibly good too: pick any fairy tale character you've heard of, and you'll find it in this movie (or the sequel), only totally different from what you expected (Pinocchio, Robin Hood, the Gingerbread Man, Snow White and the Dwarfs, everyone is included in one way or another and with a completely unexpected Dreamworks update that would make Walt Disney himself blush).Making the classic stories fresh and innovative for the new century (and millennium as well), Shrek demands to be seen by every kid, teenager and adult on the planet.Don't miss any chance to watch it!8,5/10"
60,Shrek,4,22 November 2004,It didn't amuse me,"I just couldn't wait for this one to end. Oh yeah, the effects and animation were good enough, but I just found the film's humor too obtuse. There wasn't a single joke that didn't walk right up and slap you in the face. Also, a lot of the humor was what I would call inappropriate for kids. I didn't like Murphy's donkey character, I didn't like Meyer's voice for ""Shrek"" it made me think of his disgusting character in the second ""Austin Powers"" movie. Cameron Diaz was well placed in her role. As if it wasn't bad enough, after the ending of the film I was compelled to watch a horrifying ""extra"" ending with the ""lovable"" cast dancing to awful music. This is the stuff of nightmares."
61,Shrek,4,21 May 2003,Dull,"Not much to say on this one except how staggering it is that a) it is in the top 120 and b) children apparently like it.It's almost as bad as the equally awful Monsters Inc. It plods along with no laughs & a story as weak as urine that never really goes anywhere. I was bored enough that I never even observed the 'Disney in gags' that I've just found out the film had a plenty.It wasn't awful, but nor should it be mentioned in the same breath as the brilliant Chicken Run or Toy Story 1 & 2 which show how animation films can suit all ages and have plenty of laughs too.4/10"
62,Shrek,4,31 January 2003,Hell,"I was in shock when I found this movie to be in the top 250. Just how the hell did it got up there is beyond me.Silly jokes, boring, uninteresting plot. This flick is as bad as ice age and the like. Monster Inc and Toy Story are the best 3d cartoon for now IMO.The animations are quite good, but not good enough to save the movie from being a pile of crap. 4/10"
63,Shrek,4,7 January 2003,Absolutely disappointed. . .,"I didn't see Shrek until it came out on video, so I never got that theater experience of watching it with a crowd that enjoys a movie.  Sometimes that can make a movie you really don't care for a little more bearable to watch.That said. . . I hate Shrek.Well, maybe hate is strong.  Let's just say it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.I'm not going to write any spoilers.  Just suffice it to say that I found the plot of the movie boring and predictable.  It's good kid fare, but there's really not much there that we haven't seen in other animated features.  Shrek seems like a forced attempt to graft a Mel Brooks movie into a computer animated world and, in the process, cut out the funniest stuff.  Most of the jokes in Shrek just fall flat for me.To me, this movie has no real heart.  The animation also didn't impress me much, either.  I'm a fan of CG, but it just wasn't that great here.  With the inevitable Shrek 2 coming soon, I think I'll avoid the theaters and go see the next Disney/Pixar movie instead."
64,Shrek,4,18 November 2002,somewhat disappointing,"4/10A lot of people said this movie was good, but i disagree. It was typical modern stupid talk that was boring after 90 minutes. Now, I'm going to put this film down completely. I loved the play on old fairy tales, (especially the gingerbread scene) and had very good graphics. Eddie Murphy is annoying and a stereotype, why can't he do good films again, and Mike Myers isn't as good as the olden days either, spy who shagged me, now this, though he was an okay ogre. This film is also very dated, there will be no new generations liking this movie. If you want to see a movie like this, pick up Monsters Inc. Now there's a great animated kids film."
65,Shrek,3,11 July 2001,Shallow and unsatisfying,"I really can't understand why everyone rates this film so highly, I went to see it with two friends and we all agreed it was a huge disappointment. It could be argued that as 18 year olds we were not exactly the target audience, but I had been led to believe that this picture had universal appeal like the excellent Toy Story, and I really could'nt see any of this.I think the major problem with this film is its attempt to be satirical of fairy-tales when it's own narrative is so flimsy and predictable. Whereas some amount of predictability should be expected, Shrek sticks like glue to its pre-defined genre expectations on more than one level. The setting of the story in a land of castles, talking animals, dragons etc is OK, but some other details I really had a problem with. The princess for example is all sweet and pretty and wholesome and then she burps. I got the feeling the audience were meant to laugh or maybe be surprised at this but how many movies/ TV shows have you seen where the woman shows some ""girl power"" and acts all crude/kicks male butt or whatever. I would either like to see this sort of charecter made impossible weak and pathetic or maybe a psychotic serial killer type, just burping does'nt cut it anymore. I don't know if the people who made Shrek thought they were being wildly original or not, but to me everything in this movie seemed to be stolen from somewhere else, and not in a satirical way either. The other characters are predictable too, the donkey (Eddie Murphy) is annoying, and Shrek (Myers) is slow and boring. Myers also does the Worst Scottish Accent Ever which also slips every couple of scenes. The best role in the film is the evil guy (Lithgow), for once the voiceover is of good quality and suited to the charecter. Its a pity he does'nt get more screen time because the gingerbread man torturing scene was the best in the film, itself far too short though. This is typical of the script's tendency to skip from one gag to the next without trying to take the joke futher or refer back to it to increase comic effect. The story itself is too frail and boring to make up for the cascade of weak, underdeveloped jokes. I had pretty high hopes for this movie, as i'm a big fan of Myers, unfortunately all the best jokes were in the trailer and if you've seen the trailer, you'll know thats not a good thing."
66,Shrek,1,8 November 2001,Ugh. Go see something else.,"An overrated piece of junk could be described as the movies on MST3K. Some (no... 199/200 of them) movies today are being added to this part of lists. Here's another: ""Shrek."" The plot is flat, it doesn't make me burst out in laughter, and it makes Mike Myers and company look worse. Watch ""Toy Story"" instead... quickly, before you are destroyed by this!Rating: -12/6 PS: Now, when I refer to this movie, I shall say, ""Shrek"" (AAAHHH!)"
67,Shrek,1,9 June 2001,"Great fun, mediocre animation.","This is a great film for little girls with issues about their looks,it's funny and fast and silly and irreverent.  I only wish the qualityof the film had been better, at times it looked as though Princess Fiona(adequately voiced by Cameron Diaz) was floating instead of walking. Theanimation is not as endearing as the Wallace and Gromit films, or eventhe Disney films, but the whole enterprise has a spirit that isinfectious and great. It pokes holes in lots of fairy tale bunk thatwe've all been weened on since birth. I particularly liked the'gingerbread man' scene, he shows such pluck and vinegar that it madeyou want to stand up and cheer. Kudos to the writers and performers, butI'm less sure about this animation. It looked like a bad dreamsometimes."
68,Shrek,1,11 November 2008,Successful Corruption,"It seems like producers of Shrek doubted the strength of their storyline by itself. What else could explain the presence of the famous actors as voice performers? It was a mask for the weak scenario.""Mike Myers obviously wanted to share his Austin Powers-style comedy with the younger generation, adding some adult innuendo to keep the parents titillated,""So... that must be Lord Farquaad's castle Do ya think maybe he's compensating for something?"" Again  the film's animation, while technically superior, is cold and unappealing. There is no gain out of the voice performers, especially Eddie Murphy in his ""stock"" loudmouth idiot role. Cameron Diaz doesn't make any impression at all. An enormous cast of animated creatures, fantasy landscape and celebrity voice performers do not compensate for the lack of soul in this anti-Disney hint from a disgruntled ex-employee.The first half-hour I was waiting for the funny part, and the rest of the film I was waiting for its end. In a movie that is supposed to have a message of tolerance (although in a satirical way), there are too many familiar stereotypes and cruel jokes spread around. I'm not surprised that wide audiences enjoyed Shrek. It is the same drivel that passes for comedy in many films these days, notably, there's something about Mary, American Pie, Dumb and Dumber, the Ace Ventura movies, and anything from Mike Myers. The lowest form of comedy is juvenile bathroom humor, and it is meant to appeal to the whiny adolescent in all of us. I think it is a shame that studios are producing films that demand the viewer be brain-dead. Disney has its faults  now more than ever  and it deserves to be ridiculed, but it has to be criticized by something more intelligent than this. After all, Shrek is the misfit who dreams of being understood, Eddie Murphy is a Donkey who serves as a sidekick on hand to chip in, Cameron Diaz is a Princess who teaches us that beauty is only skin deep, and nothing is more Disney than that."
69,Shrek,10,2 November 2014,The greatest fairy tale never told.,"This is not your average family cartoon. ""Shrek"" is jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart. All that work has paid off: The movie is an astonishing visual delight, with animation techniques that seem lifelike and fantastical, both at once. No animated being has ever moved, breathed or had its skin crawl quite as convincingly as Shrek, and yet the movie doesn't look like a reprocessed version of the real world.The story follows Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers, who utilizes his Fat Bastard voice from the Austin Powers movie into the role). Shrek is an ogre who lives in a swamp surrounded by ""Keep Out"" and ""Beware the Ogre!"" signs. He wants only to be left alone, perhaps because he is not such an ogre after all but merely a lonely creature with an inferiority complex because of his ugliness. He is horrified when the solitude of his swamp is disturbed by a sudden invasion of cartoon creatures, who have been banished from Lord Farquaad's kingdom.From there we have our plot: Lord Farquaad's desire to wed the Princess Fiona, and his reluctance to slay the dragon that stands between her and would-be suitors. He hires Shrek to attempt the mission, which Shrek is happy to do, providing the loathsome fairy-tale creatures are banished and his swamp returned to its dismal solitude. On his mission, Shrek is joined by a donkey named the Donkey, whose running commentary, voiced by Eddie Murphy, provides some of the movie's best laughs. The expedition to the castle of the Princess involves a suspension bridge above a flaming abyss, and the castle's interior is piled high with the bones of the dragon's previous challengers. When Shrek and the Donkey get inside, there are exuberant action scenes that whirl madly through interior spaces, and revelations about the dragon no one could have guessed. And all along the way, asides and puns, in-jokes and contemporary references, and countless references to other movies.No doubt all of this, and a little dig at DisneyWorld, were inspired by feelings DreamWorks partner Jeffrey Katzenberg has nourished since his painful departure from Disneybut the elbow in the ribs is more playful than serious.Nowadays, actors who do voice-over work have starring roles with fat paychecks, and the ads for ""Shrek"" use big letters to trumpet the names of Myers, Murphy, Cameron Diaz (Fiona) and John Lithgow (Farquaad). Their vocal performances are nicely suited to the characters. I feel like each performance is given great care rather than just having a celebrity do the voice.""Shrek"" unveils creatures who have been designed from the inside out, so that their skin, muscles and fat move upon their bones instead of seeming like a single unit. They aren't ""realistic,"" but they're curiously real. The artistry of the locations and setting is equally skillednot lifelike, but beyond lifelike, in a merry, stylized way.Still, all the craft in the world would not have made ""Shrek"" work if the story hadn't been fun and the ogre so lovable. Shrek is not handsome but he isn't as ugly as he thinks; he's a guy we want as our friend, and he doesn't frighten us but stir our sympathy."
70,Shrek,5,2 September 2009,Could've been better than it was,"""Shrek"" (voiced by Mike Myers) is an ogre who loves the solitude of the swamp in which he lives. However, that solitude is disrupted when the fairy tale creatures in the area are forced into the swamp by ""Lord Farquaad"" (voiced by John Lithgow), ruler of the nearby ""Duloc."" ""Shrek,"" along with a talking donkey named ""Donkey"" (voiced by Eddie Murphy), goes to complain to ""Faarquaad"", who sends the two on a quest to save ""Princess Fiona"" (voiced by Cameron Diaz; singing voice by Renee Sandstrom) lava-protected castle where she is being held against her will by a dragon.Eventually, the three escape, and it becomes obvious that ""Princess Fiona"" and ""Shrek"" are meant to be together. However, ""Shrek"" wants to live a life of solitude, and ""Fiona"" is hiding a secret that she is ashamed of.Now, the two have to learn what destiny has in store for the two, or they will live lives that weren't meant to be.Let me say first that this movie is far from perfect. First of all, the story presented is pretty weak and rushed. We don't really get to see when ""Shrek"" and ""Donkey"" really get to trust one another. It appeared to me that the two became friendly somewhere between a couple of scenes. I also think that there were just too many characters in the supporting cast.I did like how the performances were handled in this movie. The actors really brought the characters to life. Sometimes, I forgot that the actors were not on camera, and I don't believe that they were in the same room when they recorded their dialog.The movie is enhanced by the wonderful animation. In fact, the animation is simply amazing. Personally, I think the animation was even better on the silver screen than it was on television. The colors of the animation is simply beautiful, and the scenery really looked three-dimensional. The use of colors was perfect through the entire movie.Realism, in my opinion, is the only downfall in computer animation. Human skin looks more like rubber than actual skin. And when it comes to realistic looking hair or fur, it misses the mark. ""Donkey's"" hair just doesn't look real to me.Another downfall is that much of the humor is not for young children. In fact, there is some language that isn't for children in this movie either. If I remember correctly, the movie was marketed as a family movie. It really isn't thanks to some jokes and language. These jokes would go over younger children's heads, and would make older children laugh when it comes to bodily function jokes. But, some references are certainly targeted to the adults in the audience.Another fun aspect of this movie is the references to other movies, and numerous fairy tales. Some movie references I didn't notice, but did notice a particular special effect that everybody has seen from a certain sci-fi franchise starring Keanu Reeves.As for the soundtrack, I can't recall one original song or musical piece in this movie. All the songs are ones you heard before, including a really good cover of a classic Monkees song. I'm not really sure if the songs fit into the scenes, but it was fun hearing them.I can only say that you should watch this on HBO on a rainy day. It's cute, but not that cute."
71,Shrek,8,14 November 2006,"Over all, I think it lived up to it's hype","I don't know if we could live in this world right now if you have not seen Shrek. I wasn't sure if I'd make it, because at the time that Shrek came out, I refused to see it. I wasn't into the computer animation, so I refused to see it, not to mention all the hype annoyed me. You know when a movie is over advertised, and sometimes that drives you more away than closer? That was my situation, but I'm glad I finally decided to give Shrek a chance.Shrek is an ogre who is feared by all the town people and prefers living his life solo, but when a annoying talking Donkey drops into his life, Donkey just kinda puts himself into Shrek's life. But when a circus drops onto Shrek's swampy home, he goes to the king, the king promises him his home back if he can go get Princess Fiona, his future bride. Shrek and Donkey do so, but Shrek ends up falling for the beautiful princess, but she has some hidden secrets of her own that just might help their love for each other.I'd have to say that I really did enjoy Shrek, it was a very sweet story with some funny jokes and terrific animation. I loved the homages to certain pop culture moments, like the Matrix, as much as it's over used joke wise, it really worked for the film and for kids who were a little too young when the Matrix came out. It's a great family film and I'd recommend it very much.8/10"
72,Shrek,3,4 November 2005,Overrated,"This film was okay,but i don't understand how everyone laughed at it so much. It wasn't that funny, I'm sorry but i barely laughed once in this film.It was kind of boring too, while everyone in my class was laughing and cheering Shrek and donkey along, i just kind of laid my head on the desk. Don't get me wrong, if people like it its fine by me. I just don't understand all the hype, its kind of got some disgusting jokes in there, but thats okay because it doesn't influence that bad of things. It wasn't that original or funny but i did like Shrek 2 better than this, that one was actually worth watching even though we only got half-way through the movie. In short, a lot of people may like this, but some just kind of shrug off and wonder why."
73,Shrek,4,31 October 2005,Hmmm,"For me this film was too hyped-up by my friends. Perhaps so much so that unless it had been a new Jungle Book it would have been impossible to enjoy. But I really thought there was nothing exciting here. The donkey was just the dragon from Mulan. That was quite irritating. I thought there was too much mush and not enough wit. I realise that I am in the minority here, and I can certainly see why kids would like it. It does what it says on the tin adequately. i just don't think it deserves the rave reviews that it has been getting. There was nothing in this movie that has not been done before or better elsewhere. One to miss."
74,Shrek,,22 April 2005,"""A talking donkey? That's the easy part, getting him to shut up is what's hard."" (Shrek)","""Shrek"" is a great little fun movie, with sharp,eye-popping computer animation and a knock-out Dolby Digital surround sound track. We have watched it a number of times since 2001.It is a story of a kind-hearted Ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) who just wants to be left alone in his swamp. A very animated talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) just wants to be friends with Shrek. Throw in a princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz) and a would-be king (voiced by John Lithgow) and the film takes fun to a new level. In what amounts to a very scrambled collection of famous cartoon characters (Three Pigs, Big Bad Wolf, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, etc) and techniques borrowed from movies like ""Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger"", the animation shows slow motion, martial artist suspended in air for a moment, etc.The script has a few slow parts, but overall is excellent, and we found ourselves either snickering or laughing out loud often. The film even has ""message"" with the creative ending, but 95% of it is just good, funny stuff. Many of the ""jokes"" will be missed by some of the younger generation, and on first viewing even many of the older crowd will miss some of the subtle references.Disk one of this 2-disk set has the movie plus a very interesting ""making-of"" special. Disk 2 has more stuff that I will get around to seeing one cold, rainy winter day. In my personal rating system, an animated film can get no higher than a ""9"" of 10. I rate ""Shrek"" a solid ""8"", which for me puts it in the same category as ""Toy Story 2"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Chicken Run"", and ""Monsters, Inc."" All of them are marvelous, fun movies that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages."
75,Shrek,6,26 March 2005,Does anyone remember when animated movies were timeless?,"The first time I saw Shrek wasn't in theatres, it was on DVD. I thought it was fun enough, but I wasn't blown away by it (other than the animation, which is quite spectacular). Then I saw Shrek 2 in a theatre on my honeymoon, and went to the Shrek 4-D attraction at Universal Studios, and I loved them. I think they made the original better in my memory. I got Shrek 2 for Christmas, so I had to get the original on DVD to compliment it.Watching it tonight for only the second time, I was struck by how quickly it has aged. Only four years since its release, and the humour and trappings of the film are getting old. That's sad, because animated family movies used to be classics. I watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a child as though it was contemporary, even though it was made in 1937, and felt nostalgic for it when on the Snow White ride at Disney World in February. Something tells me I won't feel the same way when I go on the Shrek ride at Universal with my kids in ten years (something else tells me that the Shrek ride will go the way of Captain EO in less than ten years).It's not the animation that has gotten old, it still looks as impressive as ever (more impressive than last time for me, since we were watching it on my wonderful TV). It's the littering of pop culture references and pop soundtrack that makes the film seem outdated already. All that is wrong with the film is represented with the opening credits sequence, as we get a glimpse into the gross life of the ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers). He showers in mud, uses squished bugs for tooth paste, farts in swamps-- killing fish that he'll eat for dinner, all to the strains of Smash Mouth's ""All Star"". The scatological jokes, which aren't my cup of tea, weren't what made this scene so bad. It's that they were accompanied by Smash Mouth that made it so offensive. I was immediately taken out of the movie and taken by the horrifying thought that there was a time, not too long ago, when people liked their music. And then I was embarrassed and ashamed. I didn't get back into the movie until the comically brilliant scene where Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) tortures The Gingerbread Man (hands down, the best scene in the movie). This is why you don't use pop music in movies that should be timeless, because it immediately assigns an era to your picture (to compound the problem, the movie ends with Smash Mouth's remake of ""I'm A Believer"". Yes, that's right, the movie begins and ends with Smash Mouth).It's really too bad, because this is a movie that was soooo close to being timeless. So close to greatness that many of us were fooled the first time around into believing that it had achieved it. Shrek could be a modern-day fairytale, one that could rival all of the ones of the public domain that Disney has taken hold of and this movie pokes fun at (and pokes fun at Disney for doing). Instead, it went the route that seemingly all animated movies have been going since Aladdin, the hip route, to draw in the date crowd along with the family crowd, and to appeal to today's more media-savvy child. As a result, it isn't anything more than an entertaining romp that I suspect will be less and less entertaining with each viewing.Still, it has some genuinely funny moments (even though he isn't portrayed as being funny, I thought Shrek was far funnier than the much-heralded Eddie Murphy-voiced Donkey), some good action scenes (I pop for the wrestling scene, although there are a few too many dropkicks. The ankle lock is the best), and dazzling animation that is a true cinematic accomplishment. Also, I find the character of Shrek incredibly charming and lovable. But, the story and delivery is too average to score any better than a 6 out of 10."
76,Shrek,10,20 February 2005,Best movie of 2001,"This movie is THE BEST movie of 2001. I loved that movie so much that I want to see it again. Many critics gave this movie 4 stars, so I agree with the critics and give this movie 4 stars (actually, more like 5 stars if you ask me). The humor was... uh I shouldn't say it because it's a SPOILER, but I actually enjoyed it. I laughed every time the characters in the movie did something funny or said something funny. (I shall NOT give away any information about this, because one word about this can give away the whole detail. Besides, I'm not allowed to write spoilers.) If you've seen this movie, you may want to watch Shrek 2, though it wasn't as funny as I thought it was."
77,Shrek,4,10 January 2005,Disappointing use of technology,"I saw this film for the first time over Xmas on TV. Not having got around to seeing it before, and having heard such a wide range of friends and colleagues with nothing but praise, I was looking forward to a treat. What a letdown! I kept wondering when the real story was going to get going. Ironically, the film opens with a spoof of a 'traditional' fairy story, knocking this down as if to suggest that this is certainly not what this movie's about, but then it turns out to be exactly that!Technologically the film is an amazing achievement, the detail and 'realism' of some of the animated characters being breathtaking at times. The choice of voices is also excellent, adding real depth to the characters, with John Lithgow being especially good as the villain of the piece. And there are comical moments, although sadly most are of the rather basic Tom&Jerry slapstick type involving the donkey. But for me these attributes are the ONLY way in which the movie is suitable for adult appreciation. The story is just your typical bedtime reading for a 5 year old. The big scene with the princess at the end is a huge anti-climax. Trying not to give too much away (not as if there IS to much to give away!), any movie that ends with 5 minutes of partying seems to me desperate to give the audience a sense of elation and completion, almost nothing in the plot having done so.I'll probably end up watching Shrek 2 in a couple of year's time, but mainly in hope that the plot can't possibly get worse, and it will be interesting to see what further advancements in animation have been achieved.2 stars out of 5 for animation and vocal characterisation."
78,Shrek,8,9 June 2004,The ULTIMATE fairy tale spoof,"I never saw this film on the big screen and am still kicking myself for it, but when i did eventually see it i could not help but love it. This is the ultimate fairy tale spoof telling the original fairy classic with a few hilarious twists in the tale. It spins off from almost every fairy tale ever written, as well as classic TV shows, films and celebrities.This 5 star favourite includes and all star cast with the hilarious talents of the ever great Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, along with a rocking sound track and some side splitting humour, this is a blockbuster not to be missed and a film to remember.Recommended: to anyone who is a fan of anyone in the cast of enjoys film spoofs or comediesNot recommended: to absolutely no-one"
79,Shrek,10,8 April 2004,Excellent entertainment,"This is one of those movies that everybody loves. It doesn't matter if you are a child or an old man, you are gonna enjoy this movie. It is a sweet funny story but also has some more adult jokes in between. Eddie Murphy has done some bad choices when it comes to movies lately but here he does a fantastic job as the voice for the irritating donkey. Mike Myers is as always brilliant as the green ogre, Shrek and Cameron Diaz is the voice of princess Fiona. I really like this movie because it is childish and at the same time somewhat educational. Funniest moment i think is on the DVD menu when you press ""play"" and the German pigs say ""play the movie, jah, play"" I rate this movie without a doubt 10"
80,Shrek,4,1 March 2004,Diverting but little else,"A pretty good digital cartoon, which manages to create a fantasy world that is, for this die-hard true fantasy fan, too close to the ""real"" world. Shrek is an ogre cast in the role of a hero, and he and his princess have to discover the real meaning of love, or something like that.  There is some OK comedy, but if the mule character doesn't appeal to you there is very little to enjoy here as far as that goes.  Meyer's voice for Shrek was too much like his one for ""Dirty Bastard"" in AP2 to not escape distraction.
Tacked on to the video release is an excruciating extra karaoke ending, perhaps the worst concept in video marketing ever to reach fruition, but I suppose the kiddies must like it.I saw it on video, but this one seems like more of an audience-pleaser, and doesn't play too well to a fairly empty room."
81,Shrek,10,22 February 2004,Probably my favorite kids' movie,"Shrek is one of the few ""children's"" movies that I've seen that is equally effective at entertaining adults.  If my kids want to watch a movie, odds are I'll try to talk them into this one.  It was good enough that I'm glad I have kids so I have an excuse to see part 2 in the theaters."
82,Shrek,10,8 February 2004,The best childrens film for adults you'll ever see!,"Taking children to the cinema can be an arduous experience - try sitting through the S Club film to see what I mean. Shrek is the ultimate exception. This film works fine for kids as young as 4-5 who can recognise the storybook characters and ""simple"" storyline, but there is also a wealth of humour that Adults can appreciate on a much more subtle level. I have yet to meet anyone of any age who hasn't found this film extremely funny and I would heartily recommend it to everyone as a ""must see"" movie"
83,Shrek,10,10 January 2004,the greatest cartoon I have ever seen,"I watched this movie many times, and I just can't get bored of it. The story, the characters, the voices ... they are just great! It is better than any Pixar-made movies, at least this my personal opinion. I can hardly wait Shrek 2 to come out."
84,Shrek,2,20 June 2002,Disappointing,"After all the buzz, I decided to see this film on DVD. I was pretty disappointed. The humor was mildly amusing, but not funny enough to make me laugh out loud. The animation was very jerky and the characters looked like they were designed with Poser. (Pixar did a much better job making the characters seem real and animated at the same time.) The ending was pretty predictable and I had a hard time being really interested in any of the characters. I gave this movie a 3 out of 10."
85,Shrek,5,13 January 2002,Dreck (5/10),"(I watched this on widescreen DVD, YMMV)Without Eddie Murphy, this movie would be a horribly painful experience. As it is, he makes it barely watchable.  Murphy has a longer leash here than he did in Mulan, and uses the freedom to create some truly hysterical comic moments.  But they are too few and too far between to recommend this movieShrek has terrible computer animation; terrible voice by Mike Myers [""Shrek, the Ogre with the Scottish Accent""]; and a painfully strange obsession with an assault on Disney.The computer animation is so bad that in every scene it overwhelms everything else.  Shrek and the Princess are rendered well enough, but the rest of the characters and the background look like they were designed by elementary school kids with Apple II computers.  When the town comes to storm Shrek's swamp in the beginning, I actually laughed out loud because the townspeople look so bad.  The pre-rendered scenes in many old videogames (like WarCraft II or Age of Empires) look better than this.Mike Myers does a terrible job as the voice of Shrek.  Shrek has a bad Scottish accent and I am beginning to wonder if bad Scottish accents are all that Myers can do.  I was waiting for Shrek to break out in ""If it's not Scottish, it's CRAP!"" [Stuart Mackenzie, So I Married an Axe Murderer], or ""Look at me, I'm sexy!"" [Fat Bastard, Austin Powers].  Shrek sounded like a bad blend of the two and never gained a voice of his own.Finally, the Dreamworks team has some weird obsession with Disney that comes out in creepy ways in this movie.  All kinds of ""fairy-tale"" characters that Disney made famous appear in unflattering ways.  Snow White is referred to as ""the dead broad.""  There is a recreation of DisneyLand with dolls that sing off-color songs, and the city is so ""perfect"" that there is no one there.  Why not?  Very strange.Overall, I've seen worse, but this was pretty bad."
86,Shrek,8,4 January 2002,One of a kind. Great experience.,"This animated fantasy is far and beyond others in the genre. This is the standard others will be judged by for a long time to come. A peace loving ogre called Shrek(Mike Myers) is upset when his swamp is invaded with fairy tale characters. A lonely, hysterically funny donkey(Eddie Murphy)forces his way into becoming Shrek's running buddy. An egomaniacal lord(John Lithgow)has the chance to become king, if he marries. Shrek is offered his swamp vacated if he retrieves the pretty princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz)and brings her to the midget ruler for marriage.The crude 'potty' humor is mild and does not distract from the clever written story line; and this comedy can't help but amuse viewers of all ages. Myers of course has the top billing, but I think Murphy steals the whole show. I think the witty donkey could carry his own movie someday. SHREK lives up to and deserves all of its accolades. Take the time to experience a superb story of love and companionship."
87,Shrek,3,18 May 2001,Pixar has nothing to worry about.,"There are three things that make a great, animated movie: art, story, and characters.  Shrek rates 1 out of 3.There seems to be a lot of buzz circulating about the great animation in this film.  I have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.  Notice in the film, how the animators can't get the proportions right for Shrek and the Princess.  In some shots, he's towering over her.  In others, they appear the same size.  It's not just camera angles; it's genuinely sloppy work on the part of the animators.  If I want to see lazy cartooning, I'll stay home Saturday morning.  I don't need to pay $9 for it.The artists of the film should have chosen realism or cartooning.  Instead they seem to have waffled back and forth between the two.  There was no sense of consistency.We've seen this plot, before.  Boy meets girl.  Boy doesn't like girl. Slowly boy falls in-love with girl.  Boy and girl have a falling out.  Boy and girl have a dramatic and happy reunion.  Throw in some fart, butt, earwax, and toilet gags, and you have Shrek.Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers were great to watch.  I enjoyed the relationship between the two characters.  Their chemistry is Shrek's only redeeming quality.34/100"
88,Shrek,4,31 July 2001,Bad,"I already wrote a review and it is so far back i can't be bothered looking anymore. But I have been reading page after page of Shrek reviews and I can't believe the amount of people are saying ""take that Disney"" ""Disney diserve this"" ""at last someone making fun of disney"" et cetera and all I have to say is...HAVE YOU LOST YOU MIND?Without Disney movie's there'd be no Shrek. So saying that Disney should never make another animated movie again is quite stupid. Has no one seen the classics ranging from Snow White all the way to The lion king and Alladin.But, my second favourite Disney movie is The Emperors New groove and *that* is a movie that deserved to make $250million not this load of trash.And Shrek is no where near the standard of Toy Story 2 and the original Toy Story. Even A Bugs Life was better.ALL HAIL DREAMWORKS..? yeah, they took pot shots at the company that started not only the original animation (with Snow White) but also started the craze that they are using. 3D animation. Yeah, Disney came up with it. Shrek isn't revolutionary. it's not ground breaking, it's been done before. And better too.This movie is just bad, and I hate it the more and more I read about people loving it.1/10 (for two scenes. 1 involving a blue bird)PS; Do we need another movie spoofing The Matrix, another one with Mike Myers in a scottish accent, another one with ""All Star"" by Smash Mouth on the soundtrack and another one thinking they are being smart... when really they are being stupid, boring, unfunny and making fun of the studio that gave birth to animation.Thank god the donkey didn't do a ""I see dead donkey's"" scene or I would i would walked out of the cinema."
89,Shrek,5,29 June 2001,make it stop!!!,"I first saw this movie on opening day, laughed about five times during the film, mostly at Eddie Murphy, and then left the theater and forgot about it. I sat at my computer, and wrote the following review for imdb: ""This film was four years in the making, and they should have scrapped it long, long ago. In a few months, it will be little but an embarassing memory when faced up to Final Fantasy. The animation is bad, and the voice acting is even worse. Mike Meyers' faux Scottish accent is annoying. I have one more suggestion: why only three Smashmouth songs? Why not an entire album? 5/10.""I dismissed it instantly, thinking that it would please small children who still think fart jokes are the pinnacle of humor and then fade into obscurity. Unfortunately, I was dead wrong, and I have no idea why. It is a bad film, I cannot get around that. As many times as I go through it in my mind, it is bad. I did laugh, but not very much. I was more appalled at the potty humor, something which critics and audiences alike flip out over all the time (I rarely do), but everyone seems to be impervious to them in this film. Nothing about the story was original. The climactic scene is copied straight out of Beauty and the Beast, except with a twist which is not one one-hundredth as clever as everyone seems to think it is.
And here's another slap in the face: the animation is not great. No, not at all. Even those who seem to dislike the film on these comment boards tend to praise the animation. Have they not seen the Toy Story movies or A Bug's Life? The animation in those films is infinitely better. Heck, even Small Soldiers surpassed this one by thousands of miles. I would rather watch Toy Story 2 a hundred times than watch five minutes of Shrek's dreck one more time. Also, if you have even seen the briefest clip of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the so-called ""realistic"" animation of Shrek looks as much like a cartoon as the human characters from Pokemon. Heck, even the characters from Toy Story look more like human beings than the characters of Shrek, AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOYS!Shrek is obviously going to have one of the highest grosses of the year, if not the highest. The world is a truly deranged place. I live in a world of children who have taken over and now run the day care center."
90,Shrek,8,4 June 2001,Finally!  A good 2001 movie!,"This has been a horrible year for movies so far--no doubt about it.  From horrendous comedies to lousy horror films to boring art fims it's been a sad year.  Finally, though, a really good film has come along.  ""Shrek"" is a computer animated comedy for all ages.  It's one of those rare films that adults and children can enjoy.  Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers with a Scottish accent), is a large green-skinned ogre who goes to save a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a fiery dragon.  Why?  Because evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is destroying his property but will spare it if he saves the princess.  An abrasive donkey (Eddie Murphy) comes along to help.  Murphy gets a little too loud and abrasive and the movie does have its dull stretches, but mostly the jokes are flying fast and furious, the animation is flawless and occasionally beautiful, and the whole thing has a happy ending.  There's also a few hilarious pot shots at Disney.  Go, see it and enjoy!  Well worth 10 bucks."
91,Shrek,10,19 June 2017,A twisted fairytale,"A wonderful satirical fable that cleverly subverts those well-known fairy tales, offering endless fun for kids and pure delight for adults with some astonishing visuals and acid humor while being extremely funny, enchanting and surprisingly sweet. With its colorful characters, light nature, gorgeous score, simple plot, and memorable sequences (most notably the ""Hallelujah"" montage), Shrek--though it may not be the most brilliant animated film to grace the silver screen--is ultimately a rewarding, fun experience."
92,Shrek,10,21 August 2009,Shrek,"This is a very fun movie. I saw it once in theater's when it first came out and now have it on VHS and have watched it more frequently than only a few other movies (Ice Age, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia). I have thoroughly enjoyed it each time. The sequel was pretty good but didn't compare to the first. I didn't see the 3rd one though and don't plan to either. I think they had milked the idea of Shrek just a little to much by the time of the 3rd one, (and oh my there is going to be a fourth). But don't let that stop you from watching this one! It's really good. The Kid's will love it. I did when I was younger and still do now. Eddie Murphy is great as donkey."
93,Shrek,6,2 April 2003,It was alright...nothing special.,"The way people talked about this movie I was expecting a laugh riot. Instead it was worthy of a few laughs here and there.  The first time I saw this I only caught the tail end of it (the last twenty or so minutes) and quite frankly it wasn't very funny at all.  Then I saw the whole movie and most of the best jokes are in the first hour.  Still it was only worth a chuckle here and there...I definitely don't see what the big deal was. Myers does the voice of the ogre, and he is basically doing his fat-b&st@rd Scottish voice, but he does rather well.  Murphy basically does the character he played in Mulan.  Lithgow, who does the best job isn't in it enough.  Some cute jabs at Disney in this one and their theme parks and overall it was ok, but not all it was hyped up to be."
94,Shrek,,15 March 2003,It's NOT Disney!!,"There were several comments referring how this was Disney's worst, or Disney screwed up.  Dreamworks made this, and heavily parodies many disney story elements.  So get it right before making an uninformed decision and unduely attacking a someone."
95,Shrek,4,23 May 2002,Good 3D animation bogged down with sub-par music and characters.,"What a mess of a film.  Dubbed as ""The Greatest Fairytale never told"", Shrek attempts to be everything to all people, and falis miserably.  Mike Myers plays the lead character, a crude, oafish ogre, who is usurped from his house by literally every fairy tale character in creation, who were usurped from their land by an evil John Lithgow.  Myers sets out on a quest to reclaim his house, aided by an obnoxious, loud-mothed Eddy Murphy.The main problem with this film is that, like many modern comedies, it's not funny.  Most of the jokes fall flat, or are dependant upon pop-culture for context.  Murphy is loud more than witty, and Myers' character offen resorts to crude humour to get cheap laughs.  The only real funny moments come from Lithgow.  Secondly, the music in this movie ranges from forgettable (in the case of the more symphonic pieces) to ugly (the pop songs laced throughout). The soundtrack seems designed to sell more copies of Smashmouth albums than to aid the film.  Finally, plot and character development are almost non-existant, seeming forced along by the attempted humor."
96,Shrek,4,23 May 2001,Shrek mixes feelings,"I took my time and saw Shrek twice this past weekend.  I made sure that I understood exactly what it was that I liked and disliked about the film before committing it to words.  And here's where I stand.Shrek is funny, no... not just funny.  It is by far the funniest movie out this year.  But it misses its target in a lot of different ways.  Donkey, Shrek's comic sidekick voiced by Eddie Murphy brought me to laughter every time he did anything in the film.  There wasn't a second of silence when Donkey spoke.Then there is Lord Farquaad.  This miserable little man, voiced by John Lithgow, is hilarious.  His tyrade against the fairy tale creatures is unrelenting, and his evil demenour made me double over more than once.And the fairy tale creatures as well, caused constant pain in my side. And I welcome that pain any day.  From Pinochio to the Three Bears, they were all there, and I was glad to see them.I'm sure by now you've noticed that I've left two very important characters out of this commentary.  The first, is Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz. The second, is Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers (who is one of my very favorites).These two characters suffered immensly throughout the feature.  Shrek's humour was grotesque, and found only a few times through the course of the movie.  As he approaches Lord Farquaad's castle, accompanied by his friend Donkey, Shrek comments, ""do you think he's compensating for something?"" The castle is, of course, huge and some might consider it narrow.  This joke is one of those that are intended to fly over the head of the Jr. audience, and make adults and parents laugh.  Well, I'm sure it flew over the kids heads... but when it got to the adults who were tall enough to catch it, it really wasn't funny.  That was Myers problem throughout the whole movie, he wasn't funny.Fiona, I grant, was not really intended to be funny.  At least I hope not.I think that the first main problem I had with the film was that the romance seemed to be the main point that they were trying to emphasize.  I think they should have subdued it a little more.  Maybe brought in more scenes with the funny ""faerie-tale-things,"" for a few more laughs.  Farquaad should have been in it more as well, I think.Overall, it should have been a half hour longer, and not strived for the amount of substance that it did.  The medium is great, but the presentation they were making was for comedy, and not for some dramatic romance... and then the script decided to screw the presentation over.Shrek is good.  I liked it. No, I loved it.  But still, these reservations really stick with me even days after I've seen it.  The combination of the ""image isn't everything"" romance and the comedy just didn't mix as well as I had hoped they would.Regardless of that little tyrade, I'm still recommending ""Shrek"" to all my friends, and to you as well.  Shrek is a good family movie.  A good date movie.  And a good movie to see with friends.  It's mostly funny, and generally a good time.Go see Shrek.  But don't expect perfection.  Just expect to laugh."
97,Shrek,3,22 May 2001,Ruining a good kids movie,"I wonder how much effort screenwriters put in to placing elements in a children's movie to guarantee a PG rating? Shrek has a great concept -- the lampooning of fairy tale stories is a mischievous idea, and provides some of the films best humorous moments. But these are merely asides in the film. The actual story is a pretty standard Disneyesque one of ""it's what's inside that counts."" Even the touted computer graphics (why we bow to everything that comes out of the box is beyond me) seemed jerky in places, and nowhere near the composition and brilliance of Beauty and the Beast. Still, I thought this film was for kids. How sad I was then, to hear Eddie Murphy's Donkey making sexual innuendo in his sleep. It was not necessary to advance the story; it had nothing to do with his character. Additionally, kids are treated to sexual humor about Snow White that was completely unnecessary. Inclusions such as these, which do not need to be in the film to make it enjoyable, made the film inappropriate for my children to watch (which is why I preview PG films first). I am looking forward to the day when filmmakers discover that being ""hip"" is not the same thing as telling a great, compelling story. Shrek disappoints, don't believe the hype."
98,Shrek,1,23 January 2002,Bleck! What a waste of hard drive space.,"Before I saw this film, a friend mentioned that if all the fart jokes were removed, the film would be about five minutes long. I figured, he being the cynical fellow he is, that he was kidding. He wasn't. John Lassiter and the folks at Pixar have nothing to fear from the adolescents that crafted this ""thing"". Possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen, made all the worse by people telling me how great it is. This may have started out as a great script--it is a great premise and Wm. Steig has always been one of my favorite cartoonist/authors. It seems that somewhere along the line ""the powers that be"" decided it needed to be ""pepped up"" a bit and wherever there wasn't a funny bit (which is most of the film, come to think of it), a fart, or a reference to a fart or a bodily fluid or odor would be added. Even ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"" or ""Blazing Saddles"" had more restraint! I notice that an entry for Shrek 2 has been posted. Swell. Now they can use all the fart jokes they left out last time."
99,Shrek,7,2 January 2002,Could be better,"Shrek is good but not great. The story(theme) and animation are good, the soundtrack is brilliant and the voice actors fit the characters convincingly (except Mike Myers, who I feel is miscasted). However, it lacks the energy and humour to make it an interesting film like The Emperor's New Groove. Many parts of the film it tries to make me laugh but fails, at best a chuckle or two.Ironically, the only part that is so hilarious that I can't stop laughing is not even in the original film. That's right, it's the Karaoke Dance Party in the bonus section in the dvd. Overall a good effort, a 7/10 in my book."
100,Shrek,4,14 December 2001,What do people see in this film?,"I read about how this was supposed a funny movie and how it was going to replace Disney as king of animation.  In fact most of my friends highly recommended it to me.  However, when I saw it, I was rather disappointed. The animation was nothing special and pales in comparison to any Pixar film. The humor was at times crude, dry, or just plain vicious.  The underrated Emperor's New Groove was much funnier.  It doesn't even come close to ranking with the Disney greats like Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.I think Shrek was trying to be too much at once.  It tried to appeal to kids while at the same it contained a great deal of adult humor.  (I would not want a kid to see this movie.)  The constant Disney bashing got old.  It tried to be hip in its humor, but I felt as if the writers tried to put too much in at once.  I was having to force myself to laugh.  Overall, I just did not feel pleased after watching this movie.  For a good parody, I recommend The Princess Bride or a Mel Brooks film."
101,Shrek,,14 December 2001,"Sorry, I just don't see it","OK, I just don't see why people like this movie so much. I only watched it yesterday because none of the movies I wanted to rent were in. So I settled on this, with the lowest of expectations... and that's it. No ""pleasantly surprised!"" comments from me, because I frankly didn't see ANY original jokes in this. NONE.The jabs at Disney - intended to be funny - actually just showed a raw bitterness to me, and I can't believe nobody else saw this. 
The colours were good, and some sequences were *quite* well done, but that's about it. No, I don't think Disney is in trouble just yet; after all, ""The Emperor's New Groove"" was a far, FAR superior movie, and it's such a shame that it was largely overlooked (which is more than I can say about ""Shrek""). If you want real, genuinely hilarious jokes, watch ""The Emperor's New Groove"", which practically invents its own brand of humour. If you're into the dire, simple, ""Two things: SHUT. UP."" kind of humour that died long ago in ""Friends"", watch ""Shrek"", and by all means enjoy it."
102,Shrek,,10 December 2001,if you're not one for sarcasm and dark irony,"This movie didn't touch me. It pushed me away. It was bleak and unrewarding and had little value. It was gross and sarcastic and strangely sad.After watching this film I felt similar to the way I felt after watching ""Requiem for a Dream""So sad."
103,Shrek,5,10 December 2001,"Could have been, but wasn't.","Before getting around to viewing Shrek, I waited until much of the hype and product tie-ins faded. (This took a bit of time. Luckily, I was able to see Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc.) On the surface, it seemed to have the potential to stand out in a less-than-exciting year. The films creators assembled a core of quality actors to provide voices, the music sounded familiar, it looked like the animation was top notch, and it even had a catchy name. I have to say I was mostly disappointed. Mostly. Shrek attempted to work on many levels at once, but as usually happens with films that try to be all things to all people, it was never able to sustain any momentum. It seemed to randomly appease parts of its target audience. There also were major shifts in plot direction during the course of the film. The plot was simplistic and predictable, the characters under-developed and disposable, and the music placement questionable at best. It's as if they amassed several of the basic elements that create good films, threw them into a giant pot, and hoped the stew tasted good. I'd hate to think that this much effort was wasted.This being said, I suppose it was the best animated-parody-comedy-musical-romance-action-fantasy-parable-family movie of the year. I guess it was unfair to see a Simpsons episode prior to viewing. I am glad, however, that it was the greatest film many people have ever seen. Quite a Blockbuster moment to be sure."
104,Shrek,7,26 April 2001,A delight for young and old alike,"I saw this movie at a screening recently.  It was a delightful movie with something for everyone.  I think it will be as big a hit as ""Toy Story I and II.""  The computer animation is so realistic that it is great to watch. The donkey with Eddie Murphy's voice is a real crowd pleaser.  All in all, a winner!"
105,Shrek,10,30 October 2001,DreamWorks gives Disney the big green middle finger...,"A single word describes Shrek- brilliant.  Not in a long time have I enjoyed a movie as much as I enjoyed Shrek.  This is a movie that plays on a few different levels, and manages to be entertaining on all of them.  Plus, they stick it to Disney something good!Mike Myers is Shrek, a big green, smelly ogre trying to live a peaceful life in his swamp.  He spends his day brushing his teeth with bug goo and bathing in swamp mud.  All is well until the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow in a brilliant performance) banishes all the kingdoms fairytale inhabitants to Shrek's swamp.  In an effort to regain his peace and sanity, Shrek, aided by his unwanted sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy), make a deal with Farquaad to rescue the Princess Fiona from The Dragon and bring her back so Farquaad can marry her.It's well known that DreamWorks and Disney have had an ongoing feud for years, and Shrek is the latest and most destructive shot yet.  The makers (led by ex-Disney, DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg) hits Disney where it hurts most - animated features.  No Disney chestnut is sacred. Various characters pop in and out of the film, and the sight gags playing on Disney's theme parks alone are enough to keep anybody entertained.  Without giving anything away, one of the most hysterical gags in the film involve the Princess and a little bird in a very Disney, very Snow White singing sort of way.The non-stop punches at Disney are one of the levels Shrek succeeds.  The other is that it's a pure, heart warming story that anybody of any age can enjoy.  Unlike most recent movies (animated or live action), Shrek is story driven.  Watching the film you come to care about the characters and get involved in their feelings.  I even found myself caring about characters that in any other movie would be pushed into the background soon after their ""big scene"".  I would also like to say that I commend the DreamWorkers for the ending.  It was unexpected and appreciated because it shows that beauty has many levels.  In general, Shrek can do no wrong.  I usually see at least one thing I would've done differently, but not with this movie.  I have racked my brain, and can't come up with a single thing I'd do differently.  Shrek is visually stunning, hugely engaging and has a strong heartfelt moral.  Good job to DreamWorks and PDI.  Good job to everybody involved.  Finally, good job to Disney because without you, none of this would've been possible!My Grade: A+"
106,Shrek,9,23 October 2001,It's a great movie!,"I really love this movie..I think Shrek is the best animated movie in 2001. Yes, maybe Final Fantasy is better in animation, but Shrek offers more than just beautiful and realistic animation. The characters are just fictious anyway, so they don't have to gesture like real human being.. Shrek offers us mostly fun, 'cos the story is really enjoyable. Okay,it's some kind of predictable, but it doesn't reduce the fun-thing. There are so many funny times like when the king had to choose one of 3 princess (we're not expecting that the mirror will be like a quiz host,are we?),then when Princess Fiona sang so the bluebird exploded, and I like the actions in the ""Colosseum"". Hey,it's so much like WWF Smackdown actions! Shrek acts like he's The Rock...it's fun and amuses us,right? Lastly, Shrek also contains some morality messages which are not given by other animated movies,such as Final Fantasy. Yeah,it's the best fairy tales ever told ! Go on Pixar..create another excellent movie!"
107,Shrek,9,9 July 2001,Bridges the generation gap effortlessly,"There are many films indeed that promise to provide amusement for all the family - they usually end up totally boring the parents and failing to interest the children.  As an (im)mature 30 year-old, I found Shrek to be both riotously funny and a great story too.  Judging by the reaction of the children in the audience, they loved it too.How was this achieved?  Well, the gags are a mixture of cartoon slapstick, film references and the fine interplay with Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers (and, later, Cameron Diaz).  Disney takes a (deserved) hammering throughout - but I wouldn't want to spoil any of the jokes by revealing them here. John Lithgow is also great as the prince who wants to create the perfect kingdom.  The mixture of material means there is plenty to amuse everyone and, unlike the recent Disney output, the plot is very strong too - entertainment with a message, what more could anyone want?!The one minor blemish is Myers' Scottish accent as the eponymous ogre - offputting for a British audience perhaps, more than in America.  Overall though, a triumph."
108,Shrek,3,4 July 2001,Not as good as everyone says,"Shrek is full of too many tired jokes that have been featured in just about every Mike Myers movie.  In fairness there were one or two new jokes in this movie but they weren't that funny.I was looking forward to the ""great advances"" in animation that this movie had made.  To be honest I've seen better overall animation in a PC Video game.  The 3D-ish characters were well done but they overlayed on painfully obvious 2D backgrounds that resembled paintings rather than animation. This is almost comparable to what Walt Disney did in the 40's its just that he didn't use the computer to create everything.  Toy Story was a much better animation advance than Shrek as everything in it was an integrated design.If you like bodily function jokes or Mike Myers a lot (or you're under the age of 12) Shrek would be a great movie for you.  Otherwise, stay away from this one."
109,Shrek,4,6 July 2001,What a BAD film!!!,"I can't believe this movie is at the top 100 movies of history list!
How can something so full of silly, predictible, brain-dead gags, be there? As someone told, the story doesn't make sense. The humor is nasty and cruel (what about the beginning? Yuck! And the cookie man without legs! Oh!) ""Shrek"" also kicks the butt of _all_ the stories, but not because it is good, but because the characters of these stories appear fooled in a way that really hurts to those of us that love fairy tales.I do not recommend it. If you're definitely going to watch it, do your kids a favor: don't bring them to this movie if they're younger than 13! Even for me (25) it was.... oh, God! Rent Toy Story 1 or 2, Majo no Takkyubin (Kiki's Delivery Service) or Beauty and the Beast instead. Those are animated pieces of art!Ah, and of course ""Shrek"" is going to win an Oscar! This has been really a ""cruel summer"".Don't watch this movie if you want to keep a clean soul and a clean mind, or unless you watch the animation (although Toy Story's is much better).
Don't watch it! It's very bad, nasty and stupid!!! It should be at the worst animated movies, instead of Warner Bros. version of ""the King and I"".Don't watch it, please! You'll feel that you've lost the treasure of innocence!My rating: 4/10, and only because i really like animation!"
110,Shrek,3,2 July 2001,Just another lunch box shifter,"I went to the cinema gorged on the hype for this movie.  What I found was that I knew every joke already, and that they weren't really funny.What really got me was the animation of people.  It was so bad that I would rather watch stick men.  Computer animation just doesn't hack it when you are looking at something as familiar as a human face.  This is something they knew when they made Toy Story, and got round in a very clever way. Shrek could have got round it by using caricatures for ALL the human characters.Anyway, that aside, I found the film boring, and noted that the small children in the audience at one point started shouting across the cinema to each other, suggesting to me that they were bored too.I shouldn't have gone to see this film.  If you like cinema, and are concerned with decent storylines that are engaging and intelligent, then don't go and see this film without some form of inebriation to soothe you!It really is, like Antz, substandard to Disney, no matter how many anti-Disney wise-cracks there are in there.  The story is more simple than needs be, and has no message worth 90 minutes or whatever (seemed like 30 mins to me - small blessing).  Also, I wonder if Mike Myers dare set foot in Scotland after another exploitative attempt at an accent.  Mike Myers, you are no Mel Gibson - no one will thank you for this.  Why are you bothering.Ooh, yes, and the ""hip"" soundtrack just didn't hang.  What were all those bands thinking.  Ah yes, royalties!Don't listen to the hype, and don't believe the self-referential ""hipness"". Shrek is just another lunch-box shifter."
111,Shrek,,6 June 2001,"Good, but disappointing and overrated","*Shrek* had a high bar to reach. Stellar reviews, good word-of-mouth, and my own anticipation since seeing the first trailer all led to a high degree of wanting it to be really, really *Memento*-good. While I've got *Memento* on my tongue, I can segue by saying that that movie lived up to the hype, while *Shrek* didn't quite make it all the way.I was very, very worried at the beginning. During the opening credits, they employ more gross humor than I've seen in some entire movies. Burping, farting, bug-eating, implied excrement, whatever they could think of. I was afraid. Where was the wit? The clever fracturing of fairy tales?The clever fracturing of fairy tales, I discovered, was not as prominent as I had thought and wished. Save for a few scenes at the beginning and the end, and one or the two in the middle, there isn't really that much of it. And most of what there was, I'd already seen in the trailers. The Gingerbread Man, however, should get his own movie. And I really love the Merry Men scene. I expected more of that kind of fun, but there wasn't.Where does the other humor come from? References to the butt, farting, jokes about how ""short"" [cough, cough] Lord Farquaad is, some nice Disneyland bits...and the fact that Eddie Murphy is speaking. He talks. A lot. But I like Eddie Murphy. The way he speaks, it's as if he believes that everything that comes out of his mouth is comic gold. Some of it's pretty funny. Some of it's just odd, but it's said amusingly. Some of it's just...hm, okay, he said what was in the script. But there are other really good elements of humor that I won't mention here because one good element of humor is the element of surprise.Mike Myers is excellent as well. I could hardly tell it was him. He uses a Canadian/Scottish hybrid accent that works very well. I read an article about how he actually begged to re-record his lines in this new accent because he didn't think he'd captured his character right the first time. It set the movie back three months and increased the budget by $4 million. Katzenberg thought it was worth it, and I think so too. Chris Farley was actually slated to play Shrek, and had actually recorded some lines before he died, but hearing Mike Myers' portrayal of him, I can't imagine Chris Farley doing it. I don't think he could have given him the genuine emotion that Shrek has now.Cameron Diaz. Hm. For the first fifteen minutes Princess Fiona talked, all I could see was Cameron Diaz speaking her lines in the recording room. I couldn't see the *character* saying the lines for some reason. I guess her voice was right for the character, but it took a while to get used to it.John Lithgow's great, but that goes without saying.The animation, as expected, is spectacular. It's just so amazing to see these 3-d characters walk around in their 3-d environment.So, overall...I think the movie could have been a *lot* better. Oh, I forgot to mention the music. I didn't recognize more than half the songs, but I suppose many of you will. Geez, sheesh, I sound like I hated the movie. I really didn't. My problem is I came in with really high expectations that weren't met. There's a lot of great stuff, and it's a very enjoyable movie (Enjoyability is always a plus for me). It does get my blessing and recommendation, but I just warn that you don't get caught up in all the hype. One review I just read ended with, ""but it's no *Toy Story 2*."" It isn't, but I think it could have been."
112,Shrek,3,2 June 2001,Way over-rated,"This will go down as another one of those movies that 'everyone' liked, but in hindsight, people won't be able to pick out many lines that were very funny.  It's funny how movies snow ball once a few people get behind it. Once everyone says it is good then people are afraid to say it was bad. This was not a good movie.  This was not a funny movie."
113,Shrek,5,29 May 2001,Movie with no target audience,"This is a PG movie aimed for the G audience.  It is funny, and a good story, with some cleverness tucked here and there, but hovers just above the heads of the kids toward which animated movies should be aimed.  I took my kids to see this, since they had seen so many commercials on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, and we had the toys from Burger King, so obviously the people behind this movie thought that it was for kids, but the language was too Eddie Murphy-ish for younger children.  I recommend against taking children under ten to see this movie."
114,Shrek,8,14 April 2001,A GREAT parody,"I wasn't sure, going into this film, if it was going to be some sort of ""poor-man's Toy Story"" (considering this is Dreamwork's computer animated division, ala Disney's Pixar), but was in for a pleasant surprise. This film is a degree more adult, in terms of humor, than Disney animated films, and in a good way. I don't think younger children will totally understand it, but this a film that adults will enjoy. *Watch for the interrogation scene with the gingerbread man; it's GOLD!*"
115,Shrek,1,25 April 2001,Not funny and not worth the time.,"While Shrek presents us with a star-studded cast of comedic actors, such as Mike Myers and Eddy Murphy, the movie completely fails to be funny. Most viewers will probably eat this movie up and praise it, but most viewers aren't seeking films that require thought. To the general public, the movie will be great, but to frequent movie patrons who expect more than the usual mindless junk, the film is the same old boring material.The film could have been an interesting satire. It starts out with Lord Farquaad, played by John Lithgow, banishing all fairy-tale creatures to the swamp, and introduces characters from such stories as The Three Little Pigs, and Snow White. However, the plot turns into the same old, cliché fairy-tale it could have mocked. Shrek must save the Princess from the dragon and stop the evil, power-hungry antagonist and blah blah blah. Shrek even delivers the most overused line of all: ""It's quiet. Too quiet."" As if the audience couldn't see that one coming!The worst part of all is that, in this highly anticipated comedy, nothing is funny. Eddy Murphy's endless dialog presents bad joke after bad joke. After getting covered in Tinkerbell's dust, Eddy says, ""You've seen a housefly! You've seen a Superfly! But have you ever seen a donkey fly?!?"" While most laughed in the aisles, I yawned and checked my watch. With an hour and a half to go, I knew I was in for a long, painful ride."
116,Shrek,1,23 October 2005,hated it,"awful, has to be one of the worst films before Napoleon Dynimite. If todays youth today find these films funny. There is a real problem with this country. Of course I knew that when they elected an In-educated hick as President in 04 and a cartoon as Govenor of CA in 03. I thought this was awful. forgive me all you American girls who loves this crap. Movies are made to be something. This is nothing. Buy Dave Chapelle, thats comedy, Of course Richard Pryor is the greatest ever in stand up. You want to really crack up rent Robin Williams on Broadway. Or Even better some Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. A little ""real"" talent and comedy never hurt anyone."
117,Shrek,,26 May 2001,Shrek is by far the cutest and smartest animated film since Pixar,"Shrek is by far the cutest and smartest animated film since Pixar made their name with A Bug's Life and The Toy Stories. The characters are so 3 dimensional you forget you're watching painted digital creatures thought up by animation wizards.The celebrity cast, here just voices behind the delightful celluloid images, are perfect reflections of their cartoon counterparts. Each character is continually witty without being overtly cynical. The punch lines, that number in the thousands, are often unpredictable and slap- your- knee clever. Finally, a movie for the whole family.Shrek's rating is PG but this treasure is pretty much a free for all. The PG rating is given for it's teensy bit of gross humor; eyeball eating, the slurping of a slug or two and a bit of clean-ish sexual innuendos meant for the ""knowing"" adults that will fly right over the kid's little cartoon admiring heads. Don't worry, unless you're a card-carrying neurotic that thinks TV or Brittany Spears is the route of all evil yadda, yadda, yadda ...Shrek's just fine.Shrek's story goes...Shrek (Mike Myers' voice is an ogre. You remember from the fairytales? Those big unruly fiends with Troll-like appendages, always hell-bent on mischievous mayhem and excessive drooling while devouring the poor innocent village folks? Yeah. This ogre's a little different. He lives in a peaceful swamp and minds his own beeswax, far from the village troublemaker.Until the ruler of his land, Prince Farquard orders all the fairytale characters residing in his hamlet be banished to his (Shrek's) humble, quiet, swamp.This will not do! Normally a social shut-in, Shrek finds himself besieged with unwanted overly happy- singing- rhyming guests. None more annoying then a talkative donkey who had originally escaped the prince's demands and had found Shrek along the road, and kind of juststayed.Shrek's a wreck. People, er, fairy tale creatures, and fairy tale animals are everywhere. The wolf from Little Red Riding Hood is in his bed smoking a cigar, the Seven Dwarfs store Snowy's casket-like perma-a-porta-boudoir on Shrek's dinner table, the Three Blind Mice run about breaking things with their guide sticks and chomping on his ear while the rest of the bedtime gang is gathered- camped- right in his front yard!There's nothing else to do. Shrek must go forth and make the prince reverse his orders and remove the cast of delinquent misfits that list like the usual suspects in a Grimm's tale or Old Mother Hubbard.Shrek doesn't know where the nasty prince lives. He needs help. Hmm. That annoying little donkey that won't leave knows where the prince is. Shrek grudgingly agrees to him playing escort.The little donkey is a handful for Shrek, who is use to no-one. The donkey is a jabber jaw, a rapid-fire conversationalist that babbles on endlessly about next to nothing.- Lucky for us he's given his vocal orations by Eddy Murphy, one of our finest living comedians. Eddie's just brilliant as the wisecracking, phobia-filled, intruding little mule.Together, Shrek and the little donkey, get an audience with his lord, with the prince.Prince Farquaad (John Lithgow who's voice naturally sounds a bit snobby--he's the leader from Third Rock From the Sun) is far from receptive. However, he sees a use for the odd duo, which serves his wants and needs. He agrees to return the land to the ogre, imp free, if he'll take on a brief mission. Faquuad wants them to fetch his queen to be. The woman whom he has chosen to be his bride, thusly catapulting the idiot to king status by way of marriage. DinkOff, again, Shrek and the little Donkey go. Their adventures to and from the bride's land are very entertaining. The tale refreshing even if we (adults) all know whom, what, and when within a half of an hour. This fairy tale is more like those old Fractured Fairy Tales of days past. Just off enough to keep adults hooting and just innocent enough and chock full of righteous morals to keep the kiddies mesmerized for a couple of cry-freehours.The bi-partisan cast keeps us giddy with giggles and happy as hobbitts right to its ending. Enjoy!"
118,Shrek,1,5 August 2015,Animation movie? More like animal cruelty movie.,"If it was possible, I wouldn't even give Shrek a single star. When I started watching this movie, I thought it would be an animated comedy about fairy tales like Tangled. But I stopped paying attention to the movie story with the growing amount of animal cruelty depicted in the movie. Is this what kids should watch? Frogs and Snakes blown-in to act as balloons? Kill a bird so that you can eat its 3 eggs? Really? Not just the animal cruelty but the story premise makes no sense at all. The princess who was saved by an ogre, turns into an ogre herself at night. Now isn't that really convenient?This is by far the worst animated movie I have ever seen and I have seen plenty animated movies."
119,Shrek,2,30 December 2001,No,"Here is another prime example of a terrible film gaining popularity by fooling the audience into thinking it is cool.Shrek is a fairly weak and unimaginative fairy tale.  It contains some absurd sentimentality but hides it behind lots of cool' and wacky' characters.  Shrek is ugly!  Amazing!  He can therefore be cynical and make funny comments about other people/films.  He has no need of a personality because he is ugly  surely one feature is enough for one person?  The Princess it tough!  Superb!  She can therefore have a fight.  Its so cool that a woman can do one other thing in a film apart from being a love interest these days.  But who ever imagined a woman hitting someone?!?  And the Donkey.  He is probably the most unfunny character ever.  Still, being witless does not necessarily mean the character is bad.  Unfortunately, he wipes the floor with Jar Jar Binks in the most irritating character ever awards.The animation is fantastic and inserts interest into otherwise boring set pieces.  The film looks excellent and pretends it is cool.  Therein lies its success."
120,Shrek,1,11 March 2002,Change of heart,"One of my kids hadn't seen Shrek, so we rented the dvd. When I first saw this film in the theater, I rated it a 1 out of 10, (the 1 was for the 1 time I laughed) Having now seen it on the small screen I feel I must change my rating. This film OWES me. I figure its about a negative 5 on the rating scale.I get more laughs out of 50s B-movie sci-fi then this piece of **** could ever conjure up. By all means see this film, preferably somewhere where you can have a stiff drink afterwards to wash the bitter taste out of your mouth."
121,Shrek,1,22 October 2001,I don't get it,"Where was the great story, the great character study, the overflowing laughs, the incredible computer animation? Certainly not in the film I saw. How did this movie ever get to be such a high grossing film. People must have gone back a second and third time because they couldn't believe how bad it really was. The characters had no redeeming qualities. The only one even remotely funny was Eddie Murphy. He's the reason I gave it a 2 and not a 1. The story, in general was boring and extremely predictable and the computer animation left much to be desired. Final Fantasy had far better computer animation and from the clips I've seen of Monsters Inc, well it leaves the others in the dust visually. I usually grab animation dvds the moment they come out. In the case of Shrek, well, maybe I'll watch it again when it comes out on cable but I certainly won't waste my money on it. Not a keeper."
122,Shrek,9,11 May 2009,Original and funny: delightful for kids and adults alike!,"I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox."
123,Shrek,10,17 March 2005,A Parody of Delight,"""Shrek"" is a great movie on every aspect; though animated, the characters look twice as real than any other cartoon character or CGI character for that matter. It's also a cruel movie poking fun at all of those 'soft' Walt Disney characters that people cherish in their time; now with the DreamWorks film, Shrek is a one of a kind and introducing a new hero and supporting characters.The synopsis of ""Shrek"" involves a seven foot green ogre who calls himself Shrek terrifies the people in the village. The beast has signs telling people to stay out of his swamp in which villagers want him dead, but yet, he's so harmless that in the prologue of the film, he reads ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the restroom, takes a bath in the swamp, brushes his teeth with goo and lives in an abandon rock house. In the film, he tells a creature that he is rejected by society.To those who recognize Shrek's voice, that is Mike Myers of ""Saturday Night Live"" fame and from the ""Wayne's World"" series. Though the original actor was intended for the late Chris Farley, Mike brings a presence to the jolly green giant in which not only do we laugh with the character, but we feel for him as well.Lord Farquea, (voice by John Lithgow) who resembles Disney CEO John Eisner, wants to get rid of every single fairy tale creature living in DuLac and the only way he does is by cutting off the legs of the Gingerbread Man and torturing him by drowning him in a vase of milk. As part of his quest, he wants to marry a princess in order to become king and during a parody of ""Love Connection,"" the magic mirror points out Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) out of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Now all of the fairy tale creatures are captured by Lord Farquea's men and are paying those who have those creatures; we see the three bears, the three little pigs, the seven dwarfs, and Pinocchio in cages. There is one creature who manages to escape and that is Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a talkative donkey that never really shuts up, but in the end is always right. He is saved by Shrek after being chased by the guards and decides to stick with him, though Shrek didn't say anything, now Donkey wants to live with Shrek though the green creature wants peace and quiet.To skip the rest of the story, Shrek and Donkey decide to go after Farquea and go rescue Princess Fiona in order for Shrek to keep his land. Along the way, we get to see the comedy and relationship between Donkey and Shrek, like Abbott and Castello where no matter what situation comes between them they are a duo.""Shrek"" is a funny movie that I will leave the rest of the film for viewers to see; it almost reminds me of ""Young Frankenstein"" in which the parody and jokes were subtle, though it has the cruelness of ""Blazing Saddles"" (relax, they're no slurs) I still enjoy ""Shrek""."
124,Shrek,10,15 August 2004,"fun for adults, too","This fantastically funny film entertained my whole family; adults, teenagers, and children were completely enthralled from beginning to end. The layers of humor were artfully crafted to appeal to every age group. The taunting of Disney classics was completely lost on the kids, but the teens and adults totally got the jokes and the put-downs. The myriad of fairy-tale characters were hilarious corruptions of the ones we know and love from the stories told at bed time, and the surprise ending renewed my faith in happily-ever-after. We now own this film, and my kids have watched it more times than I can count, but every time they see Shrek and Donkey do their routines, they are in hysterics once again."
125,Shrek,8,9 August 2004,intertextual piece of ogre sized fairy tale fun,"Granted, the CGI in Shrek is different from e.g. Ice Age, Monsters Inc. or Final Fantasy but that doesn't make it bad CGI, it's just different, Ice Age had super cool Water Surfaces, Monsters Inc. had super cool Fur effects and FF had the hair but Shrek has an Ogre and a talking Donkey and that's hard to beat! i.e. effects aren't all in fact in Shrek these are secondary. As the plot thickens - and there's little time wasted before it does - we get entangled in so much cross references to well known fairy tales and popular movies that it's pure fun to watch (even if you don't get all the intertextual references).The voice acting is simply hilarious and I urge anyone to go see the original version if possible. While localized versions surely have their own style and touch it will not be the same as with Eddie and Mike on the helm. Let's just say voices like these ""come in short supply"".If you expect CGI mayhem and a genuine ogre fairy tale you might well be disappointed but if you like a fast paced fun ride through fairy tale land and if you want to know more about the Muffin Man then this is for you and please watch out for unwanted physical contact from she dragons.Fun for the whole family. 8/10"
126,Shrek,3,11 December 2003,Really quite awful!,"This movie was advertised as a controversial and new kind of a fairytale. Even the critics said that this movie was fresh and different. I was quite anxious to see the film after all the good reviews I had heard from my friends and the critics.After a little while watching this movie I noticed that this movie differed very little from any other fairytale. This isn't always a bad thing, but when the movie was marketed as a controversial fairytale, I felt cheated. This movie was still too conservative. It was very sad to see a movie that tried to be something that it never could be. The american movie makers are just too loyal to money to make something really new. This movie had even the most basic ""be nice to each other"" moral lesson.Anyway the animation was quite good and the actors were okay but the movie was horribly conservative and unfunny. 3/10 Yuk!!"
127,Shrek,10,18 November 2003,Deserves to be in best TWENTY movies of all time!,"IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS RENT IT AT ONCE. Shrek is one of my alltime FAVORITE movies. It was one of those things where I didn't want to see it and a friend just finnaly sat me down and made me watch it! Then I saw it again the next day.....This movie will pull at your heartstrings. I can't think of THAT many movies I was that stunned by. Don't go into this expecting just another animated movie because it isn't. Shrek is going to be a part of history.
I could go into what this movie's about(friendship, love, kindness and vulnerability etc ) but none of that would capture the essense of this enchanting treasure. The day after I unwillingly watched it, I was so blown away I showed it to someone else who was even more anti-shreck then I had been and THEY loved it! Shrek is the best animated movie ever created and one of the best all time movies ever created."
128,Shrek,,3 July 2003,Completely Overrated,"I never wanted to see this movie.  I was forced to.  I laughed at a few jokes but not as many as the writers planned to.  Ok, the lame jokes I could deal with, because, what new movie is REALLY funny this days?  I haven't laughed at a movie theater in a long time.  Anyways, the thing that really bugged me was (ok, maybe I went a little deep into thought here, but) WHY DID DISNEY MAKE PRINCESS FIONA BECOME AN OGRE LIKE SHREK?!!  This movie automattically shows what Disney's point of view on interracial marriages (or couples).  Why couldn't Princess Fiona remain human and Shrek continue to be an ogre?  Fiona's changing into an ogre could've been deleted out of the script easily without much effect to the ending.  Was Disney scared that parents would complain to them that two totally different looking people can't love each other?  It's obvious that Disney is more concerned about their own welfare than about today's morales."
129,Shrek,,26 April 2003,Terrible - Drek,"0 out of 10This film was quite unfunny, dull and painful to watch. The inside Disney jokes, while I'm sure were hilarious to the makers of the film, come across to the ordinary viewer as being unpleasantly cynical and depressing. The graphics were underwhelming as well.For a GOOD kids' movie which adults can enjoy watch Monster's Inc. Intelligent, cute and the special effects are truly amazing."
130,Shrek,,17 February 2003,doesn't live up to the hype,"I heard so much about Shrek before it opened, and more in the weeks that followed. I really wanted to like Shrek, but unfortunatly I just didn't. The writers tried to cover up the lack of a decent plot by adding ""in"" jokes that weren't even funny. And am I the only one who noticed what an opprotunity Disney lost when they decided to turn Fiona into an Ogre? For me, the story could have had a strong theme about interracial relationships, and looking past appearences to inner beauty. Instead, they added the twist ending, and turned her into an ogre. This movie was surprisingly unfunny and i'm still amazed by the number of people who comment on what an amazing message it gives to young viewers."
131,Shrek,,19 January 2003,Bored kids will be told that they are ungrateful,"Spoilers warning. The one thing going for children's stories is that they can include the MOST grizzly and frightening characters and plots and the kids will lap it up. The more gruesome the better.How then can an expensive fairytale film like Shrek be SO DULL? The only action scene is finished within the first 20 minutes and the remainder plods along with characters getting to know each other, falling apart and then coming together again in a film totally hamstrung by Hollywood's neurotic obsession with weddings and marriage. Sure Cinderella and Snow White END with Prince Charming sweeping the Princess off her feet but this film has the hero and heroine talking to each other about it over and over and over and over again. It never ever ends! No child could enjoy this over Disney's Snow White or Cinderella.The writing is poor in SO many ways with plot holes and poor motivation throughout. It can't even fulfil it's own pathetic ideals. The Princess turns out to be an ogre, right? Well they don't even make her that ugly. In fact her waistline is exactly the same as that of a statistically average American woman. Get the message kids? The fact that a) this film was made and b) there is to be a Shrek 2 says it all. Hollywood is unable to do anything intelligent anymore and we should all stop watching this crud unless we want to be fed it over and over again for the rest of time. You have been warned."
132,Shrek,10,22 December 2002,A cute film that effectively mixes old fairy tales with an unusual twist.,"I'll admit that I did not harbor any inclination to see this film, however upon seeing this, I must say that it was exceptionally well done. Of all the computer generated films (ie Toy Story, Ice Age, Monsters Inc. etc) this has been my favorite, and a favorite of my two year old brother. It never fails to keep him quiet, even during a tantrum. For that purpose, I recommend ""Shrek"" for any parents or babysitters to have ready.As for the film itself, I was pleasantly surprised. It took traditional characters, like an ogre or a princess, and assigned them to very untraditional roles. With an ogre for protagonist, the film subtley explored many themes unknown to the child-oriented fantasy world. Discrimination and self esteem, namely. There are many lessons to be taught from this film, and at the same time entertaining. The vocal performances on all counts were well done and unique. The humor could be at times rather vulgar, but the film never claimed to be seen through rose colored glasses. Anyway, the humor goes right over the heads of young kids, so there's nothing to worry about to that effect. Actually, I found the coarseness a refreshing break from the usual sugar coated reality that seems unavoidable when looking at other childrens' films.  Essentially, this film is for the entire family. Not too adult for young kids, and not too childish to keep the attention of mom and dad. Very universal!"
133,Shrek,5,7 February 2003,Disappointing.,"After all the hype this movie received, I was rather disappointed.To me, it was less fairy tale than it was a soap opera for kids. When the Princess reveals to Donkey that's she's an ogre and makes the comment about loving something so hideous and Shrek overhears and thinks she's talking about him -- a daytime plot if I ever saw one.Kids, no doubt, will enjoy it. I thought it was quasi-lame."
134,Shrek,2,19 June 2001,Over rated but and not full filling,"I went to see Shrek because of all the good ratings and all the hype placed on it.  When I walked out I was not fullfilled, I found the movie to be quite dull and the ending was....not the greatest in the world.  But many of the scenes made me laugh and many of the scenes made me want to gag.  I do not think it deserves higher honor than Pearl Harbor(and is now getting better ratings than Pearl.  And also would it get such great ratings if it had a newcomer cast?  Come on, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, and Mike Myers?  How many of us would not have seen it if it were not for the famous, over payed cast?  Maybe it would be in the Millions.  So if you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you don't waste your money on it and see Pearl Harbor instead."
135,Shrek,7,7 January 2018,Dead Meme,"I desired Onions After Watching, But Nevertheless found the Movie To A Moderately Enjoyable Experience."
136,Shrek,8,14 December 2017,Most Intellectual Comedy of All-Time,"Truly an outstanding, clever and a classical masterpiece that is highly disregarded by the liberal mainstream. ""Shrek"" had inspired every age group to have an unstable sense of humor after watching it the fortieth time. The soundtrack is a work of art rather than the corporate trash that is produced from Hollywood nowadays. Children, adults and senior citizens would die from suffocation when they exhale each breath in their lungs by laughing from the clever jokes such as the reoccurring toilet humor you'd expect nowhere but from ""Shrek"" and/or Ajit Pie (Is that how you spell it?). Had it not been for this film, I have no right to live or even exist in this hard cruel world with no sense of humor whatsoever. God bless the Shrek Oligarchy and God bless the audiences."

141,Shrek,9,18 October 2017,This film rightfully deserved the Best Animated Feature Oscar that it got.,"Lord Farquaad dumps a bunch of fairy-tale characters near Shrek's swamp, so he has to go to the land of Duloc, where he lives, to get his swamp back. Eventually this leads to him teaming up with Donkey to rescue a cursed Princess named Fiona that Farquaad wants to marry, and an attempt to foil the Lord's proposed marriage to her.This film, which is the start of a 4-film franchise, is Dreamworks' first successful animated feature (the directors started out as a Technical Director on 1992's Toys, and as a background designer in 1981 on Kwicky Koala, Superfriends, and Trollkins, respectively).Humor: The decidedly adult humour adds a wider audience appeal to this film, but might go over most children's heads.Animation: The animation is extremely well-done for its time, nearly matching the quality of the VFX of The Lord of the Rings and AI. The mixture of photo-realistic humans and cartoonish fantasy characters was rather unique for the time, but is now commonplace.Music: loses one point for including a very annoying Smashmouth song which led to the group losing its mind whenever their contribution to Shrek was mentioned on Twitter. The underscore is a lot better, though.In other words, Shrek is one of the essential animated films to watch."
142,Shrek,10,21 September 2017,"If this were a human, I'd bang it","Shrek was lighthearted, yet really opened up on some serious issues. Here we see the fairy-tale creatures being segregated from society. Shrek, the hero of this fine film is not who he seems. Shrek is not only a journey for the freedom of the fairy-tale creatures, but it is also a journey of self-discovery for Shrek, as he realizes that he doesn't have to live his life by himself. This film featured some amazing voice acting thanks to Mike Myers and left the audience giggling throughout the whole movie. Shrek was an enjoyable movie with a reasonably funny plot, however the highlight of the movie was definitely the voice acting."
143,Shrek,10,15 September 2017,Good film.... no honestly....,"This is a good movie, the chemistry between the two main actors (shrek & donkey) is something to behold & i also think that shrek has a great future ahead of him in the movie business if he continues to perform like that. I story line was top notch of course as steven king is a great, great writer of horror. Shrek is a cunning foe, playing mind games on donkey; left, right & centre..., you just can not predict what old shreko will do next! The twist is phenomenal where shrek turns out to be a toilet cleaner & a damned bad one at that, i thought he was the head of the FBI or something with that kind of flare for deception!"
144,Shrek,7,14 August 2017,Some real talent behind the microphone,"""Shrek"" has a big heart, and when it's in the right place, the focus is on the characters and the message of acceptance. Mike Myers and (especially) Eddie Murphy leave their marks on a mostly successful spin on fairy tale clichés, and this movie has some serious laughs going for it. Not all of the references work, though (good lord, bullet-time? The Macarena?) and it could've done with a lot less Smash Mouth.But none of these are deal-breaking. This has likability written all over it, to go with the pointed jabs at Disneyland (to go there is to realize how smart this movie is) and going on a quest with an Ogre, a donkey, and their feisty princess is a lot of fun.7/10"
145,Shrek,9,23 July 2017,The Greatest Movie Ever Made in the History of Cinema!,"Premise: I must say that I prefer movies of the '50s and '60s, so I am not much of a fan of today's movies, but yesterday, I was home and I turned on the TV in search of something to watch and I found this one hell of a movie!I was blown away when I saw this because although I am 27, I really enjoyed this movie from the beginning, with Shrek that starts his day in his swamp, then he meets Donkey (my favorite character) and with his help try to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona from the dragon's keep. Never in the history of cinema a movie had the twists and turns that Shrek has, and for three reasons:(1) The settings and backgrounds are fantastic, you feel like you are in the movie, they're so realistic with the wind that blows in the leaves and grass. (2) The cast is fantastic, with Mike Myers using his fake Scottish accent and using also some Austin Powersesque jokes, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Cameron Diaz as the beautiful and tough Princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as the evil Lord Farquad, that after he declares himself King, he gets eaten alive by the dragon. (3) The soundtrack is amazing, not only with the Smash-Mouth songs, but with the Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's music score in almost all the movie, it has also a starring role within the character's actions, especially in the Escape from the Dragon and Saving Fiona from Farquaad parts.I want to talk about Donkey, my favorite character. Voiced by the great Eddie Murphy (''Trading Places'' and ''48 hours''), he looks a bit annoying, like in the scene where he meets and follows Shrek all the way home, and he embarks on Shrek's journey to regain his swamp. He has always something to say and his best jokes are the funniest, like when he discovers that the Dragon is a female dragon, and she falls in love with him, or his first scene at the resettlement center with his owner and when he gets covered by TinkerBell's dust which gives him, although briefly, the capacity of flying.The story line it's great too because it has also his drama moments, but the comedy moments are larger. This movie it's also a satire about tolerance and the fact that a person should accept another person not for his physical appearance, but for the feelings a person shows. And people should learn this from Shrek; if you are mocked by other persons for something of you that is considered ridiculous, ignore them. I passed this also personally in my life.The only scene that scared me is the one when Shrek and Fiona find a snake and a frog and blow them as balloons, but the best scene for me was Lord Farquaad's torture towards the GingerBread Man.I also understand why it had a great success and even earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Movie back in 2001! And I also saw the featurette about all the making process and technology behind the Shrek movie.And for me it's without doubts THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA! If you never saw this, see it at all costs, and you will pass an enjoyable hour and a half!"
146,Shrek,10,19 June 2017,Fantastic,Waring spoilers This film is amazing lets start with the story it's a parody to mock Disney's princess and musical formula which is a great idea and is highly unique then there is the animation it looks great especially when this movie has a 60 million dollar budget and the characters are highly likable and funny the best part of the movie is when lord Farquaad dies.
147,Shrek,6,21 March 2014,Animation gone wild.,"In this Dreamworks animated film, green ogre Shrek discovers his swamp has been bombarded with fairytale creatures by the scheming Lord Farquaad who wants to be King, and sends Shrek to fetch him the Princess Fiona in return for his swamp back. In the process, Shrek falls in love with Fiona, who has a secret of her own.This movie is one wild animation ride, full of mildly funny jokes and gags and adventurous scenes you've come to expect from an animated movie. This film also makes references or pokes fun to scores of other animated movies, mostly notably ones from Disney, and live-action movies such as Jurassic Park - almost like a Who Framed Roger Rabbit feature, but not as tastefully done considered the amount of modern twists and crude puns.Shrek is a typical fairy tale with a somewhat exciting story that also delves into the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, voiced by comedians Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Put the two together, you could get an unending laugh-fest that keeps the movie going.Overall, it's a very average animated film. It's fine for the children, but with parent supervision.Grade C+"
148,Shrek,7,16 September 2008,"Not bad, but I don't get why people love it","I found some very funny things to laugh at in ""Shrek"" and managed to enjoy it somewhat. However, I simply don't understand why people are so crazy about this film. It's funny, but not that funny. Often times it comes off as just annoying and not very funny, with crude humor and jokes that don't make me laugh much at all. It can be a fun film, with great lines that you'll remember forever, particularly those from Donkey (Eddie Murphey), such as ""I'm makin' waffles"" or ""Pick me, pick me."" Those lines are great, but I personally don't see this as a monumental film at all. Sure, it entertains, but I don't see how it revolutionizes Hollywood. Eddie Murphey is a perfect voice for Donkey, but Mike Meyers doing a strange accent for Shrek just comes off odd to me. Cameron Diaz is also as annoying as always, and I wish her character was more lovable. It would move the film along better. Without giving it away, the way Lord Farquod is done away with (killed) is very unappealing and sudden to me. The ending doesn't really work. All in all, enjoyable, but not a film that should be so big and popular. Worth watching, but I didn't find it as monumental as most people seem to.*** out of ****"
149,Shrek,6,30 August 2006,OK But Not Great,OK but the most overrated film since the horrendous Bambi. Mike Myers is annoying as the Scottish ogre that is Shrek whereas Eddie Murphy doubles the films rating with some great one liners i have met Eddie (once in London) he is hilarious. The film begins poorly but picks up as it goes along but moves back down towards the end where Shrek and Princess Fiona (a poor piece of casting i am sure someone else could have done better at a cheaper price than Cameron Diaz did) marry and she becomes an ogre which is supposed to be a good thing in the film HOW? This film is OK but for it to appear higher than any Carry On is an insult and utter stupidity
150,Shrek,,18 July 2002,Absolutely Hilarious,"Fall over funny. Simply put Murphy and Myers together leave me in stitches every time I watch it.  It may be not be high brow, but it is witty and clever. It's got something for kids and adults, and even big kids. One of my favourites."
151,Shrek,,20 June 2002,Somewhat over-hyped,"I thought the story line was ok in today's standards. Thankfully, the violence scenes were short. The jokes were not very funny for adult audiance except for a few lines by Eddie Murphy. The worst part of the movie, I thought, was when Fiona took on the French Robin Hood. Not a good scene for kids unless you like them to grow violent.  Why is there always open season on anything French in Hollywood?   The movie does not carry any particular message or moral value  unless you are an adult and analyse it to death. It is still fun to watch this movie though I would not recommend it to folks over 50."
152,Shrek,7,21 May 2002,A rather flat film with its moments,"While this was a decent film, I still can't put my finger on why I felt it was so average. Granted, some of the humor was littered with double entendres, it just didn't suit me. Maybe it was just the plot being a little too thin or the fact Shrek was a pretty one-sided character until the very end. I did like Eddie Murphy in his role as the donkey, but other than that, the film just didn't strike a chord with me. Solid, but not memorable."
153,Shrek,10,24 May 2001,THE MOST HILARIOUS MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"OMG! I can't tell you how much I love this movie! Every minute, there was something to laugh at! The end was the most funny! The whole place couldn't stop laughing! We were all cracking up! I know I was red like a tomato! And I was so glad that there's a ""family"" movie for kids and adults! Anyone can see this and will laugh to pieces! Eddie Murphy totally cracked me up as the smart-talking donkey! Well, what can I say? The whole cast was PERFECT! And the animation...God. I couldn't believe in some scenes that it was animated! Anyone who hasn't seen this movie...YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT!!!!! I GAVE IT 10/10!"
154,Shrek,10,24 May 2001,Ingredients for a great time at the movies:,"Take the best of Tex Avery and Jay Ward, throw in MARVELOUS performances by Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow, mix in some SPECTACULAR computer animation, add some cool songs, a dash of crudeness, a pinch of Disney jabbing, and a touch of a sincere ""don't judge a book by its cover"" message, stir, sit back and enjoy."
155,Shrek,9,24 May 2001,"How ""The Frog Prince"" should have been told!","Shrek is miraculous!First, you should not be allowed to see any other movie until you have FEASTED your eyes on this animation!  I finally got tired of saying, ""How did they DO that?""Second, it is so clever.  When they get around to the obvious jokes, they do them brilliantly!  For instance, when Shrek finally gets around to saying, ""I have to save my ass,"" you WON'T groan.  You'll be delighted.  The gross stuff comes off as cute.  You won't be grossed out, and you won't be embarrassed in front of your precocious little ones.Third, if you were not captain of your football team, head cheerleader, or any kind of golden child (in other words, 99.9% of us) you will LOVE the ending.No more hints.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  NOW!"
156,Shrek,9,23 May 2001,I Laughed I Cried It was Better Than Cats!,"Shrek is a welcome addition to the animation genre that recognizes that ""for children of all ages"" doesn't mean dumbed down. A clever, creative romp through the world of the Fairy Tale, Shrek is a visual wonderland that never smirks at its own wit, nor loses its heart.  Its not often that any film these days moves its audience to applause midway through...yet mine did. My one caveat is that I wish Hollywood would take its own advice, and stop judging people by their looks.  Its nice to plug this film as encouraging children to see people for what's inside...now if only the entertainment industry would do the same."
157,Shrek,10,23 May 2001,A fantastic film for both kids and adults.,"I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect and I must say that I was absolutely blown away. Some great voice-overs, fantastic animation that pushes current technology to the edge of the envelope and a pretty good plot with an actual moral make this one of the ""must-see"" movies of the summer.If you are keen, you'll also notice quite a few fun jabs at Disney. Off the top of my head there's Cinderella advertised as a mental case, Snow White, ""She lives with seven men but she's not easy"" and of course the mainstreet/small world parody when Shrek and Donkey first arrive at the castle.This animated film definitely deserves two enthusiastic thumbs way up. A must see for both adults and children alike!"
158,Shrek,,23 May 2001,"Excellent entertainment, sloppy animation","I really enjoyed Shrek as light entertainment. There is nothing profound in it, but it neatly, and frequently, skewers fairy tale conventions and characters, especially the Disney ones. One has to watch it a couple of times to catch all the spoken jokes, and probably another time to catch all the visual throwaway gags which hang out in the corners of frames. In this regard the movie is clever, well written, and charming in a low sort of way. It is suitable for all ages, even with mildly borderline subject matter in some of the jokes and references. The little kids will not get the 'worst' ones, while the non prudes on the adult audience will laugh heartily.A couple of fine scenes include the one with Geppetto turning over Pinocchio to the fairy-tale-creature bounty hunters for a payment in gold ("" I got here a talking puppet!""....""But I'm a REAL boy!"" ... ""Then throw him in the pile with the other possessed toys!""), the duet between the princess and the bluebird, right out of at least three Disney classics, in which the princess wins the high note contest while the little bird, well, loses. And finally, a certain gag pulled countless times by Foghorn Leghorn on a certain chained dog is repeated here with a chained dragon...the setup is obvious, then they make you wait ....for...it, then the inevitable 'yipe!'. Great stuff. Did I mention the cat fight between Snow White and  Cinderella?However, being a fan of good computer animation, I was disappointed in the quality of same in Shrek. Many people have commented on how perfect the animation is here, but they either don't know better, or simply are not paying attention. The CGI folks have come up with some software which provides an improvement in the way skin, muscle, fat, etc., move on the skeletons of the characters; it is better than we have seen before. However, the animators apparently never graduated from cheap Saturday morning cartoon level character movement. Almost without exception, the lead characters move like poorly operated marionettes, the secondary characters are worse yet. Almost any Disney classic was far better in this regard. Another problem was patchy and inconsistent interface between the characters and their environments. For example, walking characters often seem to be levitating slightly above the ground, or perhaps they are failing to depress grass under foot, etc. Two fine CGI animated films, Antz and A Bug's Life were made concurrently, by Dreanworks and Pixar, respectively. In Antz, the animators were happy to have ants climbing a flower stem which was stiff, lifeless, and had leaves looking like they were plastic. In an almost identical scene from Bug's Life, the stem and leaves were swaying slightly in the air, the leaves were translucent (like real leaves by golly), and the whole assembly of the plant interacted with realism to the movements, shadows, etc. of the characters. It is this inspired attention to detail which makes Pixar the best CGI studio in the world, and why the Dreamworks crew is still the runner up. If only Pixar had made Shrek. Oh, but I still loved it as a whole."
159,Shrek,,22 May 2001,"appreciated the great animation, but disappointed in crudeness.","My 10-yr old son and I saw the movie together.  The animation by Dreamworks is fantastic and the storyline was very clever and original.  Unfortunately, crudeness is presented during the opening frame and escalates throughout the movie.  I would not see it again for that reason, nor will we be renting it when it comes-out on video.  It is truly sad that production companies present such crudeness and family unfriendliness in a film that had such great potential.  My son has not commented a lot on the movie, except to ask why such-and-such scene (rude and/or crude) was in the movie.  For those interested, we are fundamental Christians.  It is SO sad that the film industry does the above-mentioned to ""family films"".  :-("
160,Shrek,10,22 May 2001,Great fun for adults as well as one to take the kids to.,"The movie is fun with some jokes that adults will catch but the kids might not, yet the youngsters will still laugh and enjoy it. The story is well done, the voice-overs are great, the animation quality is amazing, the music gets you moving and grooving.  My husband and I both loved this movie and said it is a ""must own"" when it comes out on video or DVD. We left the theater feeling we'd been well entertained and that is what we hope for from a movie.  This one delivers and then some."
161,Shrek,8,22 May 2001,What can I say? ((Possible SPOILERS)),"Everyone else has pretty much said everything for me.I gave ""Shrek"" a 10 outta 10 because, well, there was no option for any rating higher than 10!!!I originally wanted to see the movie merely because of the graphics (as I am an aspiring computer graphics artist)... but after seeing the trailers/previews, I became interested in seeing it for more than just the graphics.Boy, am I ever glad I did! I'm a fan of Disney movies, but as others have said, Disney obviously follows a set pattern for their fairy tale movies, and it gets old after a while.Well, ""Shrek"" is not from Disney, and that's probably one of the reasons I liked it! For me, the ending was totally unexpected, because I guess I was expecting a Disney fairytale-type ending, when the ""beast"" (Shrek, in this instance) becomes a dashing prince...My favorite character was Fiona. When her character first shows up, she seems to be like your typical fairytale princess. But she turns out to be a belching, kick-butt, warrior princess with an attitude and a mysterious secret.And then there's Donkey. What a hoot! Other people complained about his incessant chatter, but I think that's one element that made him so funny! I was a little disappointed that Murphy slipped in a ""d*mn"" in there as he and Shrek set off on their quest through the sunflower field, but other than that, I loved Donkey! ""And in the morning, I'm making waffles!""The graphics were, well, totally indescribable!!! Sure, I've seen pics from ""Final Fantasy,"" and I have to agree that they seem to have just a bit more realism in them, but that doesn't really count.I watched a behind-the-scenes show dealing with ""Shrek,"" and they revealed that when they did Fiona, she looked *so* real that they had to *pull back* on the technology for her so she would fit in with the rest of the characters. This means, they probably had her looking so real she woulda fit right in with the ""Final Fantasy"" characters.As for these people who have dissed ""Shrek,"" all I can do is remind you that ""Shrek"" was an official competitor in the Cannes Film Festival, and is the first animated film in 50 years to be so. Plus, it got a standing ovation after its showing... that means a standing ovation from some of the best in Hollywood... You can't beat that!!!"
162,Shrek,10,22 May 2001,It's the funniest movie to hit the shows in a very long time!,The script is wonderful. It has a good story line of not judging things by how they look. The fun poked at Disney is hilarious! Eddie Murphy as the donkey was a stroke of genius. The animation is some of the best ever done. The relationship of the characters makes this one of the best movies ever made whether live action or animation. It has more humor for adults but is also funny for youngster which makes Shrek an ideal family movie.
163,Shrek,10,22 May 2001,Suprisingly Delightful,"I went into this film with low expectations.  My youngest son asked me to take him, and not wanting to miss time with him I did.  What a wonderful surprise!  The technology is extrordiary, to the point that from time to time you have to remind yourself that it's animated.  I'm struck by the similarities to ""Close Encounters"" when it first came out, in that it is lightyears (pun intended) ahead of anything else that I've seen.  The difference is that this movie will stand up over time, which I don't believe is the case with ""Close Encounters"".Bottom line is this: If you don't have a kid to take to this film, and you're embarrassed to go alone, borrow someone elses (just be sure to return them), as this film is absolutely worth seeing."
164,Shrek,9,22 May 2001,really funny,a really funny movie. Eddie Murphy shines as the donkey's voice. certainly not your normal goody goody fairy tale ending animation movie. totally Hilarious. 9 out of 10. ** must see **
165,Shrek,9,22 May 2001,Shrekervesence!,"In the old days of animated movies, you always had a syrupy-sweet movie in which the hero overcomes big odds to win the heart of the fair maiden or some such nonsense. Nowadays, however, kids aren't as gullible. So for the past few years, studios - including but not limited to Disney - have come out with some very cool movies that have appealed to both children and adults. Toy Story was a pioneer in this field, although it's not the only one. Follow the evolution to Antz and A Bug's Life, and finally you come to the present masterpiece, Shrek. Shrek is a giant green ogre (voiced marvelously by Mike Myers) who lives alone in a swamp. Every now and again the people from a nearby village try to oust him (shades of Frankenstein!), but he scares 'em away right proper. But unbeknownst to Shrek, the evil Lord Farquaad (don't read it too quickly in front of kids!) has banished all ""fairy tale creatures"" from the forest and placed them on Shrek's swamp. Imagine his surprise! (The creatures include knock-offs of Pinocchio, the three pigs, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and so on.) And to add insult to his further injury, a charmed, talking donkey named Donkey (voiced by the inestimable Eddie Murphy) wants to be Shrek's pal. To get the creatures off his land, Shrek goes to the source of the trouble - Farquaad (John Lithgow). The evil one, after Shrek beats the beejezus out of all the lord's knights, tells Shrek he will get rid of the fairy tale creatures if the ogre will go on a quest for him. The quest, it turns out, consists of Shrek journeying to a far-off castle and rescuing a fair princess (Cameron Diaz). Oh yes, and slaying a dragon, too, to get to her. Does this sound like the typical kids' film so far? And of course, Donkey must tag along. One of the best trends in recent yeards regarding these animated movies is that when producers get celebrities to voice characters, they give the celebrities free reign to improvise a little. Murphy is hilarious, audacious, and absolutely riotous as Donkey. He easily steals every scene he's in, which is most of them. Murphy's as funny here as Robin Williams was in the original Aladdin, a wild, untamed bundle of energy and raucous humor. He drops a couple of mild double-entendres and the requisite flatulence jokes and a whole bunch of pop culture references. Lithgow is wonderfully sneering as the short-statured lord, both despotic and self-serving, but one of those Snidely Whiplash-type characters who always seem to be muttering under their breath, ""Curses! Foiled again!"" Diaz has a lovely voice, tenuous when it should be, strong and mighty when it should be. But it's Myers as the humble and yet garrulous Shrek who's running things here. He's at times petulant, antisocial, and moody, but also courageous and very knightly indeed. There are some who have quibbled about Myers' using a Scottish accent for Shrek, but according to reports the actor (who's from Canada) was originally supposed to do a Canadian accent. Personally, I think the Scottish one's a lot better. This is great whiz-bang fun, and the in-jokes never let up. Watch it all the way through!"
166,Shrek,,21 May 2001,Do you smell gas?,"SHREK is DREKA bumbling, abomination of gas and low brow hijinks, Dreamworks second CGI comedy seems neither animated or comedy.Based on a children's book by William Seig, SHREK (Mike Myers) is the ugly ogre who is at odds with the changing world and anachronistic times.  Lord Farquaau (John Lithgow) is the short, repugnant ruler vying to be crowned King.  Farquaau who¹s been banishing all fairy tale folk out of his realm to make way for his vision - industry (A visual joke at one of Dreamworks animated rivals popular theme parks and merchandising bonanzas, the joke was good for a second until falling as flat as the screen it projected on). Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy round out the top billed cast as the token damsel in distress and talking animal sidekick, a donkey.  With some visual reminiscent of the Bros. Hildebrant and Maxfield Parrish, it¹s a shame the contrived humor of the piece owes more to HALF-BAKED then HOMEGROWN.Murphy continues his patented hammy delivery, carried over from Disney's MULAN, and it works.  His donkey had the best lines and always the best delivery.  If only it was the donkeys¹ movie to carry and not Mike Myers as an ogre.  Myers, a newcomer to animation, carrier over his Fat Bastard brogue as the voice of Shrek.  The soft, rich Scottish tones seem as out of place as out of place as anything else.The film scores itself with a variety of performers from Dreamworks stable of popular recording artists including SMASH MOUTH and the EELS.  When Ogre and donkey get into a mock wrestling match with some of Farquaau¹s men and a Joan Jett cover by Half-Cocked plays, I couldn¹t process what I was seeing. The juxtaposition of so many labored, dissimilar devices didn¹t equate good humor or even entertainment.  It became an annoying convoluted mess of grade school laughs and poor storytelling.Only in the brief scenes involving the banished fairy tale creatures did fresh, invigorating humor begin to appear.  The three little pigs break dancing, the Gingerbread Man under interrogation, even tired jabs at Pinocchio seemed funnier and worthy a guffaw.  The fart, ear wax, booger, ass humor of the ogre/donkey rapport registered a lackluster harumpff. Considering the time and talent spent on the production of these types of films, one would hope the creative process would give way to fresh thinking, new ideas, and most important strong, impressive entertainment.  Given the films reliance on flatulence to carry a scene though, it¹s no wonder the film ultimately stinks."
167,Shrek,,21 May 2001,"Well done, if you like this sort of thing","Disney, having decided a long time ago to be more directed toward the younger generation, has done a good job of entertaining them.  While critics of an older age may think of this as vulgar, we, as in my generation, find it hysterical.  We do know a classic from a 'crappic' however we love to be entertained.  I realize our humor may be vulgar, but that's what makes us laugh.  In this movie we have some rather deep instances including the fact when Shrek is talking about there being more to him than an ugly face and bad temper.  We all have a dark side that we desperately try to hide, as does the Princess.  When she comes to terms with that dark side and she uses it to make her happy, it shows we're all strong enough to make anything about us into a good thing, no matter what it is.  With both Shrek and Fiona being ogres in the end, we can see that it's not what's on the outside, but what is on the inside that really counts.  These well thought out morals added to the, quote, ""vulgar"" humor, makes this movie acceptable and quite outstanding."
168,Shrek,9,30 April 2001,Instant Classic,"Wonderfully clever.  Drop-dead funny.  The best animation offered to date. These all describe Shrek, and yet don't even begin to cover how much fun this movie is.  Dreamworks has hit a Grand Slam with this one.  I predict this one will be beloved by many for years to come."
169,Shrek,10,21 May 2001,Myers a comedic genius,"In Shrek, we have the merging of outstanding writing with awesome graphics. The characters look alive because of the computer animation, but they live because of the outstanding writing.  The range of emotions by Myers and Murphy is amazing.  This movie is the embodiment of all that we go to the movies for:  1. humor  2. action  3. love  4. fantasy.  This movie is COA (Classic on Arrival)"
170,Shrek,10,21 May 2001,comic genius,"not knowing quite what to expect, i saw shrek yesterday (5/20).  this film completely blew me away with the exceptional quality of the script and crisp dialogue.characterization was exceptional.  cameron diaz does a superb turn as princess fiona after her somewhat questionable outing in charlie's angels. mike meyers was, as usual, very funny, despite the fact that at any moment i expected dialogue from ""the spy who shagged me"" every few minutes.john lithgow's casting was brilliant, and his performance perfect for the part.  eddie murphy, whom i normally find to be kicked up one or two notches too far, exercised greater restraint to good effect.and the directorial jabs at disney, et al, were pure genius.i am very much looking forward to whatever goodies appear on the DVD."
171,Shrek,,21 May 2001,Finally...,"I would just like to say - Finally, a fairy-tale type of film that did not end with the beautiful princess and a handsome prince living happily ever after.Shrek is a great film. With a lot of tongue in cheek humor that small children shouldn't be understanding (""I think he's compensating for something""), it's a film that should appeal to audiences of all ages.
I went with some friends of mine, and it was their second time seeing it. Though it has only been open for one weekend, everyone I talked to that saw the film LOVED it. Yes, it ribs at Disney and there are cheesy references to other fairy tales (i.e. Pinochio), but it adds to the context of the film, and provides for some great humor (at one point, the 7 Dwarves put a ""dead"" Snow White on Shrek's kitchen table, and he replies with ""Where did this broad come from?""). I could see it three or four more times and still not be sick of it. It's a great film, and has a great moral at the end! I would say the ending, but I don't want to give it away!! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!"
172,Shrek,,27 April 2001,Pretty darn good,"Shrek is no Toy Story, but is still a pretty darn good film. Dreamworks has done a fantastic job of parodying a number of fairy tales and classic Disney animations in a way that is both hilarious and sometimes full out crude. It definately deserves a PG rating.The character animation and environment renderings are phenominal! It has a really unique and almost puppet-like quality that audiences will surely love.Unfortunately the writing is pretty weak and there are some jokes and conversations that are downright awkward to listen to. However, Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy pull off great performances which help to smooth things over.Overall, I'd give Shrek a 7/10. Good stuff. I'll definately go see it again."
173,Shrek,10,21 May 2001,funniest movie of all time,This movie is an instant classic.  I was not ecstatic about seeing this movie but after seeing it I can tell you the hype for once was right.  This movie had some great dialogue.  Eddie Murphy as the donkey has not been this funny since his Raw and Delirious days. The animation ( which is by far the best ever) helps bring the jokes to life.  The great animation will keep the kids intrigued while the adults are laughing at the somewhat sophisticated humor.  Some of the jokes are obvious but who cares this is the funniest movie since There's Something about Mary and may go down as the funniest of all time.  I give it a perfect 10
174,Shrek,7,21 May 2001,"Enchanting, but conflicted","The good: DreamWorks has pushed the envelope even further, somehow. The characters feel like they've popped right off the fairy-tale page, though a few of the drawn ""extras"" feel a bit cardboard-ish, given what we now know of digital capability in the animated realm. There are some breath-robbing humorous scenes and stand-on-the-table musical numbers (a remake of the Monkees' ""I'm a Believer"" will stick with you), which will keep the turnstiles clicking. Kudos to the writers for going to the edge for hilarity's sake. It pays off well.The bad: At times the pace is slower than Lord Farquaad's wit and there are too many run-of-the-mill references to bodily functions. The film tries too hard to please all of its too-wide demographic, and at times pleases no one. There were more than a few restless tykes at the theater. When they're not happy, few others are. And Eddie? We've heard that voice before. You mean none of the voices from either of the ""Nutty Professor"" movies was available, you had to go with (albeit far less raw) stand-up tones? Irritating, given the fact that Donkey is chattier than all combined on ""The View."""
175,Shrek,9,21 May 2001,"Fun, Fun Movie!","Excellent fun movie.  Good to take entire family to as long as the kids are in the 8 or older bracket.  A lot of the humor would be lost on the younger kids.  If you want to go see a movie that is funny and doesn't take itself seriously or anything else as far as that goes, then this movies is for you. If you are expecting something deeper or want some kind of social commentary then pass this movie up."
176,Shrek,10,20 May 2001,more than a pleasant surprise,"i personally decided to go see the movie because it looked like a fun and good movie to see. i really went in with no expectations. but boy did i come out with a totally different perception.  this movie is probably the best i have seen in a while. and it is great for the whole family. it is funny for children while witty and clever for adults. i had originally heard that this movie ""poked fun"" at fairy tales. the reality was that it never did it directly, but was very tasteful and really not that noticeable. the problem with fairy tales is that there is that certain ""recipe"" that every one follows. this one takes a detour, and in a far better direction."
177,Shrek,6,23 April 2002,Smug and Self Indulgent,"Maybe it's because I knew too much about what went on behind the making of this movie, or maybe it was the stale retread jokes, annoying characters or cliché themes that we were supposed to believe to be fresh.  I just didn't think much of this movie.  The blasting of Disney by Katzenberg was too obvious for my taste, the character of Donkey really bothered me.  I like Eddie Murphy a lot more when he's live and doing crazy things like pretending to be ""Mr. White"" on Saturday Night Live or making fun of some of the stranger aspects of Stardom in ""Bowfinger.""  If the movie is about not judging by appearances, why all the short jokes related to Farquad? Frankly, the only parts I found funny were John Lithgow's deliciously malicious villain bits, especially the joke about the gingerbread man. Otherwise this movie feels about as smugly self mocking as Charlie's Angels and far less sexy.
6 out of 10"
178,Shrek,6,17 April 2002,An average animated film,"When I saw Shrek on video the other day, it was no way as good as I thought it may have been. Sure it gave me a few laughs and the story was OK but I personally can't understand how it won its BAFTA and I perferred Toy Story II.On the good side, some of the characters and their voices were excellant: Eddie Murphey as Donkey, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona were some of the best casting choices I have seen for a long time. And 'characters' such as Monsieur Hood, Lord Faquart, the Dragon, Donkey, the Mirror and of course, the little wooden men in the infomation kiosk were fantastic. However I couldn't stand Shrek himself.And also the songs: every single one was fantastic. Especially if you got to see the characters such as the 'YMCA' and 'Who let the dogs out?'.But overall, an average animated flick."
179,Shrek,9,20 May 2001,Charming despite puerile bits,"We found funny physical humor (despite the fart jokes), frequently entertaining repartee, and interesting takes on ""short"" and on ""ugly"". It was nice to see Disney teased. There was almost but not quite too much of the Donkey... excellently voiced and animated."
180,Shrek,10,9 April 2002,"""Shrek"" is a brilliant masterpiece","""Shrek"" is a brilliantly written masterpiece of animation, which fully deserved its recent Oscar. The genius of the piece is due to its appeal to such a wide audience: the surface humor and plotline are simple enough to be enjoyed by young children, while there are many subtleties clearly included for adults. The casting in the film is perfect-in fact, Eddie Murphy is more perfect for the part of Donkey than for any other part I've seen him play. The film's comic gems include a scene in which Lord Farquod is interrogating the gingerbread man and ends up reciting the nursery rhyme ""Do you know the Muffin Man?"", Donkey's rendition of ""I'm a Believer"", and Donkey's attempts to sweet-talk a fire-breathing dragon, among many others. I give this film as many stars as possible and encourage everyone to see it, regardless of age. I first saw this movie dubbed in Italian with English subtitles, and even that did not take away from the film's comic brilliance."
181,Shrek,,9 April 2002,"Sorry, but I can't see what all the fuss is about","This movie is really pretty formulaic, right down to the Eddie Murphy support character, (lifted from Disney's Mulan).  It's enjoyable enough, and the bit with the family of birds gave me a grim chuckle. But I'm not convinced we've got anything that special on our hands here. When it was released critics seemed to be falling over each other to praise its deconstruction of the fairy tale myth. This doesn't strike me as anything that original. Postmodernism and irony have been part of Western cinematic tradition for quite a while now. So let's not credit the makers of this film too much on that front. In general I'd say that this film  lacks the sense of charm, and universal appeal that a film like ""Toy Story"" is grounded in. And also, censoring lyrics from an, ill-fitting, cover version of Leonard Coehn's song ""Hallelujah"" didn't win it any points with me either."
182,Shrek,,18 March 2002,"wow, i cant believe how many pans there are","Maybe it was my low expectations, but I enjoyed this movie SO much when I finally saw it on video.   Its one I can watch over and over as my kids continue to watch it all the time - i find more to laugh at each time.Its not deep, but just clever and witty and FUN.All of you that are dogging this movie....""you're going the right way for a smack bottom!"""
183,Shrek,6,17 March 2002,Nothing that makes me wait for 2004...,"I must admit, I am a huge Disney fan. but don't get me wrong, I am also an animation fan. And nothing wrong about the annimation or the voices. Watching Shrek the first time is funny and a lot of pleasure. Teasing Disney is no problem, and at times even funny to recognize situations like ""a small world'. However, there is one big difference with Disney. After I saw Shrek 3 times, things get predictable, and some jokes are annoying and no longer funny at all. As where Disney classics are real classics : some I have seen more than 25 times, and they can still make me laugh, make me cry or make me part of the adventure. Shrek is a one time thing for me, no need to buy on video, vcd or dvd. Watching it 3 times in the cinema was enough for me. I rather keep expanding my Disney classics movies....."
184,Shrek,7,20 May 2001,This film is funny.,"This is neither a politically correct film nor is it directed solely at kids, a la another animation company that has churned out crap in the past few years.""Shrek"" is a funny, very irreverent piece of film-making that spoofs Disney films (what, they are sacred?) and spins a good yarn, too. The postmodern references are a hoot.Someone didn't like the Gingerbread Man torture sequence. Why not? It was hysterically funny. And *SPOILER ALERT* The Gingerbread Man's return at the end of the film is a hoot. Yes, there is some bathroom humour in this film, but there are some rapid fire jokes that are howlers. The dialogue crackles and it trusts the adults in the audience to know what is funny.The kids will like it because although much of the real humour will be way beyond them, the story and the slapstick antics will keep them glued.This is one of the freshest animation films to come out of Hollywood in years. Of course, you will not like it if you thought ""Pocahontas"" and ""Hunchback"" were masterpieces."
185,Shrek,,11 March 2002,Hysterical with a message,"Much like Shallow Hal and Bridget Jones' Diary, Shrek deals with learning to love people just the way they are. Unlike the previous two flicks, Shrek is a beautifully animated fairy tale with an edge. The voice overs are priceless (especially Eddie Murphy as the loudmouthed Donkey and John Lithgow as the egotistical Lord Farquaad), and sharp, witty dialogue (I could've done without the ""toilet humor"", though) and hilarious pop culture spoofs abound. I almost split a gut when Shrek started crooning Billy Joel's ""Just The Way You Are"", and the fairy tale/Disney characters (especially the Gingerbread Man) are all clever and inspired. Well done, Dreamworks!"
186,Shrek,6,7 March 2002,Without my TV Guardian...,"The movie was much more enjoyable while watching the movie on DVD with the TV Guardian translating the ""toilet talk"" and innuendos to nonoffensive communication. Would have been a very humorous movie even without the bathroom talk."
187,Shrek,,10 March 2002,"Commendable, but not Pixar","I didn't see this movie until after it was released on DVD, and until that time, I heard from so many people how good it was. But it just didn't do much for me.Technically, it seemed inconsistent. Even though Shrek and Donkey looked great, none of the ""human"" characters did. The plot was all right. The humor was hit and miss. But I still found myself not liking the character Shrek a whole lot at the end of the movie, and it's important you like the main character in a movie.I suggest you watch all of the Pixar films first. They're all better--hands down. Even Bug's Life. And if you haven't seen the most recent, monster-laden offering, you're missing out on likely one of the sweetest movies ever.What it all boils down to is, Shrek and Donkey just aren't Woody and Buzz."
188,Shrek,,18 February 2002,Disappointed After Raves,"First of all, I find DreamWorks' animation to be ugly.  The characters' motions are utterly amazing, but the rendering of faces is awful.  I didn't see Antz because the ads made my eyes hurt.  Pixar has the sense to stick to characters that fit the available technology.Second, after all the raves I expected a well-written, clever film.  What a let down!  Can anyone tell me what the point was of having all the fairly tale characters?  They played absolutely no role.  And what was Farquar's motive for banishing them to the swamp?  Not even the shallowest of reasons is given. Not even, ""He's evil and doesn't like fairly tales.""  In more able hands, a brilliant parody of fairy tales could have been crafted.  Instead we get a fairy tale with farts and a slight twist at the end. Brilliant.There are a few good gags that hint at what Shrek could have been -- a few Disney references (""He can fly!"", the Beauty & the Beast ending, the ""It's a Small World"" information booth), the bluebird scene.  It could have been a smart skewering of Disney movies, and it had a world of possibilities with the fairy tale characters.  Sadly, it passed on all this potential and went instead for butts, burps, and just a bit of language -- you know, for kids. Some uninspired fairly tale jokes to make adults think it's being clever, and there you go, success.Oh, and deduct 4 stars for using the painfully tired ""Matrix"" joke."
189,Shrek,,27 April 2001,Its a movie you will have to see again,"I was lucky enough to be invited to a pre-screening of the movie.  There are some very funny parts (""Eat me!"", ""I need a hug"")  That you are laughing so hard and so much that you will miss other jokes.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I haven't laughed at a movie like I did last night in a long time."
190,Shrek,,5 February 2002,A note on the accent,"I love this movie.  I remembered enjoying it greatly when I saw it in the theatres (despite whining children -- who in the world brings children to a midnight showing anyway!  Or to violent R-rated fare such as Training Day or Black Hawk Down, but that's another story) and after just watching it again on DVD, it holds up completely.  Eddie Murphy had me cracking up completely (EVERYBODY LOVES PARFAIT!).In response to some people's complaints about Mike Meyers' scottish accent in this movie, if you thought it was a bad accent, that's because it wasn't supposed to be a pure scottish accent.  In an interview with Meyers that I saw at the time of the release of the movie, he explains the accent.  At first Shrek had a pretty basic Canadian accent (I would expect elongated O's, aye's and hosers), but he didn't think that the accent worked.  The accent that is heard in the movie is meant to be a predominantly Scottish accent with some Canadian undertones...I believe Meyers described it as a scotsman who has lived much of his life in Canada.Just a little tidbit of info for anyone who cares to know."
191,Shrek,,28 January 2002,"Promising cast and premise, but tamer than hoped for results","As a fan of both Mike Meyers and Cameron Diaz, this seemed to hold promise for me, even without their real images present. When I heard that it was a spoof of most all fairy tales, that seemed to have potential. And its description as an animated movie with appeal to grown-ups as well as children seemed to mean its promise was well realized. But on seeing it I found it to be at best a lukewarm realization of that promise. Part of the problem, I think,is how it explicitly makes reference to the fairy tales it draws upon, an awkward and corny device compared to the seamless spoofing I was expecting. In that regard it reminds me somewhat of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, a movie I thought would have been better without its explicit reference to its toon / human dichotomy. About a third of the way or so through, that movie started explicitly talking about toons vs. humans, and from there on it was only about half as funny and effective. Another problem with SHREK is that it fails to find a really rip-roaring climax to build up to. That makes it on the whole somewhat lame. Knowing these things in advance might have helped me expect less and hence find the movie more rewarding. It does have its moments. If you don't let your expectations soar too much, you might find there are considerably worse ways than this to spend an hour and a half or so. It might be a bit generous, but I'd rate this one three stars."
192,Shrek,,20 May 2001,Truly inspired.,"A long time ago, I saw a movie that was a parody of fairy tales that was both heartwarming and laugh out loud funny, that succeeded in _being_ a fairy tale as well as sending up many of its conventions through a strong sense of wit.That film was ""The Princess Bride"", possibly the best fairy tale comedy ever made, and Shrek is quite worthy of following in its footsteps.
One of the things that comedies these days tend to forget is that the characters have to be _likeable_.  If they repulse you, then the whole thing will come off as not funny but extremely obnoxious.  In TPB, Wesley and Princess Buttercup were _very_ charming.  This film features some truly endearing characters, especially the flawed but loveable hero Shrek.  Yes he's antisocial, but there's a sweetness and warmth to him, no doubt thanks to the great animation team and Mike Meyers (who, however, put a wee too much ""Fat Bastard"" into the performance).  Cameron Diaz's Princess Fiona shows a lot of depth, as she is remarkably at the same time spunky yet passive, as she shows a surprisingly take-no-crap attitude for someone who's waiting to be rescued by a handsome prince.  She also shows surprising vulnerability in a scene that would spoil the film if further discussed.
Then there's the donkey, who in his sidekick role is notably non-annoying and actually quite entertaining, and is played on the mark by Eddie Murphy. The amusing Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)rounds out the cast of characters.But the question is, is it funny?  Yes, very much so.  Ignore the flatulence jokes after the first few times, this movie has a sense of visual wit paralleled by the verbal gymnastics of The Princess Bride.  All of the fairy tale references (and the none-too-subtle digs at Disney) were completely spot on, especially memorable moments like the torture of the Gingerbread man, or any of the 100 mile an hour references in the fairy tale character trade-in during the beginning.  However, the cream of the crop by far has to be one particular fight sequence involving the princess- Eat your heart out, Carrie-Ann Moss.Simply put, this film is the most purely entertaining film I've seen in some time.  Pay no attention to some of the surprisingly negative user comments here; if you do, you're probably missing out on one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year."
193,Shrek,7,28 January 2002,A Great Animated Film With Sometimes Almost Cynical Humor,"I'm a Pixar fan and I really like Toy Story and A Bug's Life, probably more for the animation than anything else these films offer (although they do offer more than just that).That alone got me interested in Shrek which is also a computer animated movie albeit not from Pixar but from PDI. I haven't seen Antz, the last CGI offering from PDI, so I can't comment on any progress they might have made compared to that but let me compare the animation in Shrek to TS and ABL:First of all, the animation in Shrek is excellent, especially that of the main characters. I think that the Donkey is probably the overall highlight here but the lifelike rendition of the human(oid) characters deserves special mention as well.The overall _impression_ the animation in this movie makes, however, falls short of Pixar's efforts. It is hard to make out exactly what is lacking but let me just say that there seems to be not quite as much detail especially in the background and also a generally less ""fluid"" feel to the whole affair.I remember being both painfully (for betrayed desire for technical savviness) and fondly (for nostalgia) reminded of Commodore C64 games by a background character in the ending. He was looping through the same 60 frames of hand-clapping and head-nodding mechanically for what seemed like an unbearably long time. I can't help but think that in a Pixar movie the same character, although barely seen in the background, would have been a merrily applauding individual with a personality and whole story to tell from his own point of view.But of course this is not a graphics demo but above all a wickedly funny and at times rather clever movie. Maybe I found it funnier than some of you because I was so totally unprepared for the cynical humor this movie keeps lashing out at you with. I mean, I've seen mainstream animated films with witty gags but some of the stuff in here really caught me off guard. Remember the scene when Princess Fiona sings to the blue bird?<SPOILERS>The explosion of the bird followed by the nest and the deadpan shot of the fried eggs is almost Pythonesquely hilarious in its unexpectedness.</SPOILERS>I kept rewinding to it and it totally left me in tears from laughing so hard at a scene like this being casually thrown into a movie that seems so innocent from the outside.Yes, the ending is predictable, and yes there seems to be an odd prevalence of toilet humor but this is still an entertaining movie with a number of insanely funny lines and gags.And adding to my comments about the animation: While Shrek doesn't quite reach Pixar's level this is some serious eye candy for any CGI/rendering enthusiast and has some of the best _individual character_ computer animations ever converted from bits to celluloid.7/10"
194,Shrek,10,30 January 2002,Utterly Fantastic!,"The comedy of the movie is combined with a great story and famous voices. As Donkey, Eddie Murphy shines, letting loose his usual rolling on the floor laughter.  Mike Myers is superb as Shrek, bringing his many talents as an actor while Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow bring constant joy in their parts as Fiona and Farquad!If the graphics arent enough to lure you to watching this movie, then let the humor do it.  Poking fun at every fairy tale movie in the book, whether its Peter Pan turning in Tinkerbell for some shillings, the Big Bad Wolf hiding in Shreks bed, or the three pigs to whom Farquad huffed and puffed and signed an eviction notice.  The Ginger Bread Man torture scene is not to be missed, showing what would happen if biscuits could talk.10/10, absolutely not to be missed!"
195,Shrek,8,24 January 2002,"Even though based for kids, it was brilliant!","Although the plot and storyline are based on child fairytales, I thought this movie was brilliant. It's a great film for all ages, and a good job done by Dreamworks. Touching and moving towards the end but with some funny action in there too.  Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."
196,Shrek,9,24 January 2002,Wonderful Animation and a Great Tale,"This is animation at its best. The entire movie is incredible and extremely well doneBut, take away the incredible technology and this is still a great movie.Sure, it follows many stereotypes but it's a fairy tale and that's the point of fairy tales. It's the way that the story strays from these stereotypes that makes this worth seeing.One last comment for my ex-roomate: The fur on the donkey's tail is nice and fluffy. Good work."
197,Shrek,,26 January 2002,"funny movie, although a tad bit predictable","This Movie was Hilarious. the obvious disney spoofs make it funny. it even spoofs a walt Disney World Attraction(see if you can guess what that is!) the problem was that whan I Found out why fiona doesn't like to be out after sunset, I saw the ending from a mile away. but anyway, the Ogres in this film don't really look that ugly, only the green skin lets you tell the differance(except for maybe the shape of the ears) but still, a funny movie"
198,Shrek,9,23 January 2002,A Delight,"I was a little reluctant to watch this film. So much had been said of how good it was and how real its animation was, I feared it would spoil memories of classics like ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"", and be anticlimactic to boot. But I needn't have worried. The animation is indeed ""real"", but the atmosphere of fantasy is not adversely affected. As for the rest, the story is exhilarating, the voicing just perfect, and the music appropriate and catchy. All in all, a great movie experience. Rating: 9/10"
199,Shrek,10,17 January 2002,Wonderful!,I never laughed more in a cinema. Really great! But unfortunately the german donkey voice cannot sing! But if I think twice - that fits better to the donkey than Murphy's vocal... Very worth to be seen! - If you like your belly aching by laughing all the time!
200,Shrek,7,20 May 2001,Some people don't know what the true purpose of the Satire is.,"Woa woa woa.We have some real malice in the comments below.  Ya think they'd work for disney or something.  I mean don't get me wrong, Disney's done some great work over the years, but it ain't the fifties anymore, and we don't have to keep making animation in that mold.  I think Dreamworks has created a very original and fresh picture here.  A fantasy animation, very much for adults, moreso than for children.  Everyone I've seen the film with, thought it was riotous.  Hilarious bits interspersed with very real emotion, thanks to the incredible graphics.  Something you simply can't achieve with animation. You can't achieve realistic, round characters with pen and ink, which I felt they succeeded with in Shrek.  And if the cutting adult humor and great effects aren't enough, watch closely so you don't miss two great ongoing jokes.  First, the constant and hilarious satrical parodying of fairy tales(Gingerbread man:Do you know the Muffin man, Farquaad:The muffin Man? GBM:the muffin man, Farquaad: Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on mulburry lane?) and second, the wonderful rips at Disney, be it the massive ""compensating"" Dulochland, the terribly long lines, the info center which reminds us, ""don't make waves and stay in line, and we'll get along just fine; Duloch is the perfect town"", or even magical ending which is taken directly from Beauty and the Beast.Many reveiewers were upset, and thought the tearing at Disney was hate driven, and it very possibly may be, but when I was watching it, I didn't feel hatred for Disney, I felt a healthy sense of outside perspective on the unbelievably silly things that people don't realize they endorse when they buy Disney.  I hope Shrek does very well, despite it's ""negative"" messages, according to other comments, for if we had no type of editorials or parodies of the insane pop culture we buy into, there would never be any type of reform or self assessment, nor any type of consumer consciousness, and we'd simply buy whatever the big companies told us to.  In that right, I think Shrek was extremely successful, and on the flaky, silly, just a Saturday night movie with friends side, I also think it was successful, as it provided more than it's fair share of laughs.  Plus I found it very ""layered"", but not like pies or parfe, only like onions."
201,Shrek,9,15 January 2002,An anti-fairy tale,"Possible spoilers.This film is both very clever and very funny. It is an anti-fairy tale - it has a prince who is short and not handsome (voiced by the very tall John Lithgow), the short Mike Myers voices the (giant) ogre, the beautiful singing of the princess blows up the blue bird, when the princess finds her true love she becomes ugly (actually that's not quite true), it parodies various well-known fairy tales and, finally, the lovers live `ugly' ever after.Then there is the artistry of the movie - the brilliant matching of the actors who voice the animated characters, and the state-of-the-art CGI animation.I saw the video version, which has a fabulous karaoke sequence at the end, and which my kids enjoy more than the movie itself."
202,Shrek,8,21 January 2002,A great film in all aspects.,"This was truly a wonderful film, and it definitely belongs on the list of the top ten best movies of 2001! The animation was great, especially for the human characters, and it was also very funny for kids and adults. I loved the scene with the Gingerbread Man (""Eat me!""). The voice acting was superb. Mike Myers uses his famed Scottish accent to bring Shrek to life in a charming, amusing way. I also liked the suave, conceited tone John Lithgow gave to the evil Lord Farquaad. Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy also do very well as Princess Fiona and Donkey, respectively. The only SMALL problem I have with the voice acting is that I'm still not sure why Robin Hood had a French accent in the film. The actual scene with him is hilarious, but I just don't get why he didn't have an English accent.VERY SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD! I thoroughly enjoyed every scene of ""Shrek"".Throughout the climax sequence in the church, I continuously had a smile on my face: first, a large grin as Lord Farquaad got his comeuppance, then a warm smile as Shrek sweetly tells Fiona how he really feels about her. Also, when I first saw ""Shrek"" at the movie theater, during the end scene when Donkey sings 'I'm a Believer', a bunch of audience members were happily singing along, myself included.This film deserves to be nominated for several Academy Awards (At least for Best Music Score and Best Art Direction). Also, although the MTV Movie Awards don't usually nominate a lot of animated films,I could see ""Shrek"" getting a bunch, such as Best Movie, Best Villain, Best Onscreen Team, and Best Fight(for either of the two fantastic fight scenes in it).So, whether you're nine, nineteen, or ninety, it would be hard not to love ""Shrek""."
203,Shrek,6,16 January 2002,A wee bit disappointing...,"I finally got around to watching this movie months after its theatrical run had come to a halt. After reading tons of articles of praise for the movie, my anticipation was at a high. Until I watched it - and I must say disappointment was the first feeling I got. Maybe it's because I waited too long, and the hype just got to me. Or maybe it's because I was expecting more comedy. Or maybe its because as a 26 year old, and 100 plus horror & action movies later, I have unfortunately lost the ability to enjoy an animated movie.With an excellent cast of comedic talents; Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and John Lithgow - Cameron Diaz can be funny at times - I was expecting a laugh riot or a movie (which wasn't). However, the middle part of the movie was a little slow and only Murphy had all the funny spoken bits. The puns were good, however, the storyline is ordinary, but I won't be surprised if Katzenberg gets the better of Disney's entry in the Best Animated Movie at this year's Oscars - but I'll make my judgment once I see the list of nominees.I would easily recommend this movie to anyone - great for families - but I wouldn't say this is the best animated movie I had ever seen (as some people are calling it) - just an enjoyable 90 minutes of your life that you'll forget in a few days time. And there's always Toy Story and Wallace & Gromit. A high 6/10. I would give it a high 7, if only there was more of Monsieur Hood."
204,Shrek,10,11 January 2002,Best Animated Movie of 2001,"This was a priceless movie -- especially the music and of course the animation. The home video also has the Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party -- awesome.I can't see how Shrek can not be selected as the best animated movie. I would even nominate it for Best Picture, but I am sure the Academy won't oblige."
205,Shrek,7,11 January 2002,Decent movie.  No really. it was.  Not joking.,"Sorry if I appear a little underenthused, but this one was just not all that it had been hyped up to be.  Sure, the technical achievement is amazing.  Some of the shots of Shrek and the environment WERE photo-realistic; others were borderline.  The inconsistency was shocking at times, especially in the beginning of the flick.  Some of the lip-synching with Fiona was just awful. Shrek went from being a full individual to a 2D cartoon without warning when the light changed.  But nevertheless, a new benchmark in the possibility of CGI has been set. As far as the story goes, I was less than amazed.  Cute individual scenes, and loaded with great one-liners, but never really flowing the whole way through.  You could tell that they had been through several re-writes, trying to please every target audience.  From the crude bathroom humor for the boys, the twisted love story for the girls, to the life lessons for the parents, this is another that aimed with an elephant gun.  Once again, the general public are sheep and bought the whole thing.  Blech.7/10P.S. *Fellowship thought*  `What if all the blue screens in the latest fantasy and sci-fi live-action movies was replaced with the environments that are now capable from the Shrek technology?  I giggle at the possibilities.'P.P.S. *widescreen thought* `I may have been even more impressed with the animation and scenery if Blockbuster hadn't stuck me  with the damn Pan & Scan version, where everything is cropped for the sheep.  Far too often the screen centered on Shrek, with the donkey's face half showing, or all the palaces and fields off the side."
206,Shrek,9,9 January 2002,"Smart, slick and hilarious","John Lithgow is a charming prince and Cameron Diaz is a helpless trapped princess guarded by a vicious, evil monster. Well, sort of!Actually, our unlikely hero is Shrek (voiced to perfection by Mike Myers), a green Scots ogre with disgusting (but in a funny way) personal habits, living in a swamp. Alone. As you might expect, given his disgusting ogre-ness. And that's the way he likes it, but his personal space is invaded by some very random misfits, including a motormouth donkey (Eddie Murphy. Who else?). This fairytale with a twist has a straightforward plot, but is more than just a family film. It is sharply written, parodying many traditional fairy tales and in particular their film incarnations, and full of more obvious jokes, but like the eponymous ogre, 'Shrek' has a softer heart; the characters are abrasive, but love, friendship and honesty about oneself are its values. The cast really bring life into the characters, and the incredible CGI animation makes Shrek's world very convincing. The action sequences have a great flow, and there is plenty of time for the slower moments. Shrek should be great for the whole family, although they'll laugh at different bits. 9 out of 10."
207,Shrek,,15 January 2002,A Must See!,"I like this film a lot.  The animation was excellent.  Truthfully, it was magical.  I think the movie was cast well.  Some of the dialogue and comedy was really on an adult level, but that is not unusual in animated movies anyway. The comedy was not overdone. It was not too long, either, the story flowed smoothly and it seemed like the movie was over too soon.  (I wonder what Shrek (2004) will be about?)*Spoilers*The prince was really funny, and the way he dealt with his personal challenge amusing.  The message in the movie was one of importance, especially in today's society when looks seemingly takes precedence over more important things like a good heart, honesty, and love. The ending was a bit of a surprise when the princess's ""true form"" was revealed.  Although there were hints along the way:  her strength that belied her size, her taste in food, and her compatibility with the ogre.  For example, when she hit a note that made the bird explode, at first I thought it was a mistake, yet I wonder now if it was just a way to get the eggs?!  The singing initially lured the bird of it's nest and the next thing one new, POP! Fiona appeared undisturbed and the camera zoomed in on the eggs."
208,Shrek,6,8 January 2002,"Over-rated but worth catching, Spoiler!","Spoiler lies within!!!:  Shrek follows the story of an ogre who goes on a mission to rescue a princess from a dragon for the evil Lord Farquaad so that he will move all the fairy tale creatures from Shrek's swamp.  The film IS funny at parts, Eddie murphy's Donkey being the main source of the humour as well as the spins on traditional fairy tales.  However I feel that it was not as clever as the makers thought, with the story ultimately conforming to the fairy tales it ridicules.  Despite a great performance from John Lithgow, Lord Farquaad is a two dimensional villain and our encouragement to laugh at his looks is at odds with the films message that it's what is on the inside that counts.  Mike Myers is unusually restrained and has done better and funnier Scottish accents in both ""Austin Powers 2"" and ""So I Married An Axe Murderer"".  I was also troubled by the ending in which Princess Fiona turns into an ogre and her and Shrek marry.  I accept that this is a spin on Beauty and the Beast, but it the same message i.e. it being fine for them to be together, because they are both pretty, except with the word ugly replacing pretty.However its still a funny film and I am concerntrating on the flaws since I heard only positive before i saw the film."
209,Shrek,8,14 January 2002,"Funny, but not satirical enough","This movie was recommended to me by a number of people, who all told me how great it was at making fun of Disney movies and other cartoon cliches. Well, although ""Shrek"" certainly makes some fun at Disney, that alone doesn't make it such a great movie. In fact, I was a bit disappointed at how little satire there actually was in this movie. Also, by the end of the movie it succumbs to the very same romantic cliches found in every Disney movie, which I hoped Shrek would avoid.But as a whole, I think there are still enough jokes left in this movie to make it great! Especially the donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, provides great comic relief and proves that Murphy can actually be funny, after the ""Nutty Professor"" and ""Dr. Dolittle"" debacles. Cameron Diaz is charming as ever, but I never liked Mike Myers and this movie didn't change that.
Finally, this movie has absolutley beautiful special effects. All in all it's a solid comedy with great voice acting, but it's not the definite ""Disney-killer"" or something, because it fails in the satire department.*** out of ****"
210,Shrek,10,12 January 2002,The Best Animation Film In 2001!!,"""Shrek"" is a very funny movie. I like the part when the Gingerbread Man was asking Lord Farquaad if he knows the Muffin Man, and he does. That was funny. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are funny, too. This is the best film I have ever seen in 2001. See it, you'll laugh at it. **** out of **** stars and 10 out of 10 stars."
211,Shrek,9,12 January 2002,great movie and much much more than I expected!,Poor job of promoting and/or advertising this movie. It never appealed to me in the theater. I had no idea it was this good. Rented it on video and loved it. My kids loved it also. It did have some harsh implied subjects and a few words that I was not that comfortable with around my kids. That surprised me and it is my fault. I had no idea it was rated PG. I wish I had seen it on the big screen once with my kids and once with just my wife and I.A weak 9.
212,Shrek,7,9 January 2002,Frequently Hilarious But Overrated Nonetheless,"Although frequently hilarious, with some brilliant sendups of Disney and Fairy Tales, the basic storyline of ""Shrek"" is routine and predictable. Character based humor relies almost entirely on Eddie Murphy's donkey character. It will be interesting to see what Dreamworks will do in a sequel, given the dead end denoument and nearly total reliance on Murphy in this one."
213,Shrek,7,6 January 2002,the animation is amazing,"An early XXI. century fairytale. Or rather, a parody. The animation is amazing (what else did you expect boy, this is DreamWorks...), the story and characters are entertaining, so my general impression is very good. Still, a remark on the so-called ""message"" of the movie. It is supposed to teach us to be tolerant and respectful to other people (and ogres, too ;-))). However, some of the gags went against this very message (when the frog and the snake are turned into balloons, for instance): this shows that the creators themselves didn't really care about this message."
214,Shrek,8,27 December 2001,A great little gem,"I really enjoyed this movie. Not as great as some people made it out to be but allot better than some of the other films that came out recently. All, and all. A great little gem of a movie. Well worth a look, even after you seen it once."
215,Shrek,,26 December 2001,"EDDIE, EDDIE, EDDIE","Shrek is a funny animated film.After my first viewing I thought Shrek was quite good. My first comment was ""Not as good as Toy Story"".However, after repeated viewings the film just gets better and better. It is witty and the voice characterizations are excellent.But it is EDDIE Murphy (as Donkey) who steals the show. He is as funny as he's ever been on film.Very few films have brought out the real Eddie as seen in his stand up routines. Ironically, it is Shrek (along with Trading Places, Coming to America and The Nutty Proffessor) which comes closest. Eddie Murphy in his rawest, funniest form is yet to be experienced on film. Probably never will be.As for Shrek. Children love it, adults love it. A film not to be missed."
216,Shrek,,25 December 2001,"Dull, dull, dull","I fell asleep after 10 minutes, woke up after around 20 minutes, discovered that Eddie Murphy was still involved and left.This is a desperately feeble movie, crude, humourless and without any redeeming features apart from the quality of the graphics, which are excellent.I suppose all that I can drag from it is that at least it's better than Wild Wild West, which I now consider the worst film I have ever seen; but this piece of dross is running it close. A pattern is emerging however... and Mr Murphy appears to be it."
217,Shrek,,23 December 2001,funny movie,Boy this movie was hilarious. I loved it from beginning to end. The animation was really cool looking. The music was good. The ending is my favorite part. This is a good movie for everyone for all ages. I recommend this movie to everyone. This is one of those movies everyone will love.
218,Shrek,,28 December 2001,"Funny, but not *brilliant* funny","Dreamworks pictures obviously knew what they were doing when they decided to create an animated fairy-tale spoof featuring the voices of the biggest names in the Biz.Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is an ugly ogre who, along with a donkey (Eddie Murphy) set out to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) who lives upon the top of a tower protected by a dragon.Along the way, the film spoofs each and every fairy tale with surprising hilarity, although, for all the hype surrounding it, I actually thought this would be funnier.Eddie Murphy as the hyper-active attention-seeking donkey is by far the funniest - but like I said, I hoped it would be funnier. 7/10"
219,Shrek,10,26 December 2001,Loved it all,"Watched it Christmas Day with my family and loved every minute!I really don't understand what's not to love about it, but it takes all kinds I guess.  Reading some of the comments below, I wonder if I saw the same movie.  There is nothing to hate here!Much appreciated and better than 80% of the rest of the movies I've seen this year.  But that's just one opinion. I can fully understand why this is already rated in the Top 100 at imdb.com. It deserves it.   Can't wait to see it again!10/10."
220,Shrek,,25 December 2001,the best animated movie (ever!!),"I have seen many animated movies and they were quite good but they didn't really seem realistic to me as much. having watched shrek, i think this may be the best animated movie ever full of realism. The film wasn't afraid to show off their artsy humor and that humor in shrek was well executed in the right parts. all of the major cast members (especially Mike Myers) did a magnificent and mellifluous job of voicing the characters. throughout the movie, i couldn't stop laughing. the film was hilarious, funny, witty and, most of all, smart. i believe this film has taken the place as well of my Top 10 favorite films of all time. if i ever have a so-so day, I'll remember to pop this film on my DVD player and sit back with some orange juice and popcorn and enjoy. i hope this film will deserve some Oscars and Shrek may be the best animated movie EVER!!! if you want to see a animated movie full of wit, see it! you will be amazed!"
221,Shrek,8,20 May 2001,A fine fantasy film..good for kids too,A rare combo these days. Great animation and a film that both adults and kids will enjoy.  It is multi-layered in an onion kind of way. Very enjoyable.  I also like the fact that the ending is quite anti-Hollywood...gives me pause that there might be some real creativity going on at Dreamworks after all...
222,Shrek,,23 December 2001,a movie for everyone!,"Oh my gosh this movie is amazing! At first I wasn't really interested even though there was so much hype, but now i think this movie was worth the hype. It is so funny! I love donkey! And I also love Fiona, she's a very strong heroine. Shrek was likable too. Lord Farquaad was so funny the way he was so short! The good thing about this movie is that it is for everyone! I loved the ending! It was just what I wanted to happen! And I loved the Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Hour! Everything about this movie was great."
223,Shrek,10,20 December 2001,Hollywood finally gets it right,"Watched this marvellous film again on video the other night, a year after seeing it on circuit, and it really is as good as I remember it being. Genuine wit, superb comic timing and a cracking pace make this one of the best films around, animated or not.As with children's literature, children's films are not taken seriously by institutions who hand out major awards, so Eddie Murphy will probably not get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the donkey (or ""Dunkeh"" to use his own accent). This is a great pity as his performance is a comic masterclass, bordering on genius. The smart-ass (literally!) jibes and whines of typical Disney comic sidekicks are dispensed with in favour of a genuinely funny, sympathetic and supremely likeable character, up there with any character projected by the big method stars of today.
The producers could have gone overboard with their post-modern ironic nods to the fairy-tale genre, in the manner of Mel Brooks spoofs (although the camp dancing Robin Hood and his men seemed an almost direct copy of the rapping outlaws in ""Men in Tights."") However all ironic touches were handled with a subtlety and sophistication very rare in Hollywood films of today: the henchman Thelonius smashing the hand-mirror to get the magic mirror to talk was sublime, as was the screaming match between the evil duke and the gingerbread man on the torture table.If there was one flaw to the film it was the slightly uncomfortable message arrived at through the transformation of the princess into an ogre, implying that you can be happy despite your appearance. The fact that the ogress looked like any plump 16-year-old girl (apart from the green skin!) won't help a generation obsessed with being thin and blonde.I'll leave raving about the animation and the soundtrack to those more qualified, but needless to say they were brilliant.All in all, the best animated film ever, and possibly the best children's film as well."
224,Shrek,,19 December 2001,An outstanding fairytale!,"When i saw 'Shrek' in my local cinema, i thought, this would be great, and it became great, the movie was shown in Cannes this summer, it would be nominated for best animated movie in the 'Academy Awards', and there's a sequel on it's way! A ogre, a beautyful, but tough princess, and a talking donkey takes out on a fantastic journey, and it becomes an unforgettable journey with dozens of jokes, many entertaining and unforgettable characters like the Gingerbread Man, fantastic battles, and realistic looking landscapes. Without any doubt, one of the biggest family movie highlights of 2001!"
225,Shrek,,17 December 2001,Shrek was beautifully done,"The story line was full of excitement and never a dull moment, the animation was very well done.  The actors who lent their voices were also well chosen. This is definitely a must see, it has something for everyone. It even had suspense, romance and intrigue.  This is a movie that even the manliest man wouldn't be ashamed of seeing."
226,Shrek,,17 December 2001,90 minutes of non-stop laughter!,"Ever since Dreamworks was created by Spielberg/Katzenberg/Geffen, it's been a serious rival for Disney studios.  First they released ""The road to El Dorado"" which wasn't bad, but it couldn't measure up to the wonderful Disney-pictures.  To accentuate this, Disney decided to release ""The emperor's new groove"": a film that was funnier than anything they had done before.  Then Dreamworks responded with ""Shrek"".""Shrek"" is a perfect mix of computer graphics beyond belief (improving on ""Dinosaur"" and ""Chicken run"") and top-notch entertainment.  Add to that an excellent cast including Eddy Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Mike Myers who give the best of themselves plus the fact that ""Shrek"" is actually nothing but one great parody of a series of well-known Disney-pictures, and you have one of the funniest films ever made!The thing that's most remarkable about ""Shrek"", is how it never seems to bore.  It doesn't have one or two minor scenes that give you the opportunity to *pause* your laughing with it; it continuously presents you with new and original jokes.  It's almost as if Dreamworks decided to divide all jokes equally over the full length of this film.  By doing so, they made a delightful film for all ages!Now all that's left to see is how Disney studios will respond to this one... ""The emperor's new groove 2"" perhaps?"
227,Shrek,9,17 December 2001,Not very subtle jabs at Disney.,"I knew there would be jabs at Disney, such as Lord Farqua being patterned after Eisner, but I didn't know how obvious they would be. Pretty funny stuff. I sincerely hope that Dreamworks invests a lot of the profit from this film in the kind of insane graphics rendering power that Pixar appears to have. The superior graphics of Pixar's Monster's Inc. NEARLY made it a more enjoyable film. The story telling and humor of Shrek wins out in the end."
228,Shrek,,20 May 2001,It's for Kids,"This movie has one demographic -- the 6 to 14-year-olds who still think ""gross"" is ""cool.""  There's PLENTY of that, and few, if any, moments when a to-be-pitied parent will have the Sesame-Street-like experience of ""Oh, wonderful -- a joke they put in for MY benefit that my kid won't get!"" Sorry, Mom and Dad, but for this movie you will probably find yourself wishing you could be balancing your checkbook instead.  There's nothing to worry about in terms of harming your child, though, so it's safe to send your kids to with their friends instead of with you.  Just make sure they know to avoid strangers and keep their eyes on the movie.  When they come home and tell you all about it (and they will), you'll feel like you haven't missed a thing.  And you'll be glad you didn't have to see it."
229,Shrek,10,8 December 2001,My humble opinion about the movie Shrek.,"The movie Shrek takes place in a fairy tale world, with Shrek, being an ogre as the main character. Shrek is an animated movie, and the animations is done very good, by far better then all movies yet. Shrek is a comedy/drama taking up serious issues such as prejudice and racism in a different reality. This film has it all, it's very funny, sad and exciting at the same time. It's timeless and fits all ages, you can watch it with your family or alone. This is one of the very very few movies that are worth a 10."
230,Shrek,10,8 December 2001,Masterpiece-Disney under attack..........,"Well what can I say,the film was one of the most funniest I've seen in years. Hopefully Disney will see that they have a lot to do in the next couple of years to try on compete with this wonderfully scripted movie....heres to Shrek 2 !!!!!!!!!!"
231,Shrek,5,6 December 2001,Very Disappointed,"After all the hype, I was expecting something unique and refreshing like ""The Lion King"". Instead I got a fairy tale with a plot used a thousand times with enough annoying Eddie Murphy interruptions that I wanted to pull my hair out every time the donkey spoke.  Sorry Eddie, stick to Rated R where you shine. The movie is too violent for kids and too ordinary for adults.  Big disappointment considering all the hype."
232,Shrek,,7 December 2001,SHREK is one of the funniest movies of 2001!,Shrek is one of the best animated films ever.  It is really funny and is also suitable for all ages.  They have some great voices for the characters. my favorite is Eddie Murphy as the donkey.  I think this is a movie that everybody should see.  Especially since it is in the imdb top 250 list.  I also recommend toy story 2 and Monsters Inc.
233,Shrek,8,6 December 2001,"Funny, in more ways than one.","I don't laugh a lot at movies. Even if I think one is brilliantly hilarious, you're lucky if you get more than a couple of good, honest, hard laughs out of me. I saw Shrek. I almost had to be rushed to the infirmary.The thing I love about Shrek is how much it makes you laugh and laughing makes you feel happy. A movie that can make you feel happy has something great about it.Shrek has a wicked sense of humor. It does does contain yuck-yuck-poo-poo-fart jokes, for those of you that like it. But it's much slyer and more creative than that in its purpose and wonderfully funny situations, lines and gags jam pack the film. The things that bothers me about toilet humor are:A) I just don't like it, ok.B) Most American comedies contain only gross out humor and don't cater to the type of comedy I prefer.But I can forgive Shrek it's toilet gags because it caters to my preferred comedy too. I appreciated this soooo much and thought it only fair that if there were laughs for me, there should be the gross-out stuff as well for those who like it and so that its greatness could be shared with everyone. But do you know what!? Even the people that like the common easy route humor, liked the more sophisticated stuff as well! *gasp* So maybe you should take a hint and a lesson from the makers of Shrek all you low-brow American filmakers, we're not as dumb as you think we are.As much as the gags have already been given away in other reviews for what few of you there may be who read this and not that of someone else, I don't want to spoil them for you. They are that much more genius when you don't know what's coming.A colourful cast of characters (featuring voices of Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow, a personal favorite) and some of the best animation ever give Shrek a great frame work with which to start, but it's its rollicking sense of humor and splendid gags that give it its center, and what a center! (9/10)"
234,Shrek,9,20 May 2001,Far better than I expected.,"And I went in expecting a lot - to get it out of the way, the CGI was nothing short of spectacular. There were a few instances that some of the background character animation was just a bit stiff, but nothing that even began to detract from the film. The movie simply looked incredible, and the framing and camera movement was excellent as well.The Plot itself was very well done - there were a few jokes that fell flat, but the vast majority of them were terrific, and there was diverse enough material to appease someone of just about any age.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good way to spend two hours."
235,Shrek,6,5 December 2001,"Surprisingly weak, though worth watching once","Surprisingly weak. The plot is typical for a  lot of musicals with the disadvantage of absence of some good music. Eddy Murphy's movie. He tries to steal the show but makes it just a pile of his little gags. At the same time the Donkey is the only character that is well developed. The songs do not go with the plot and the characters. I believe that it is very difficult to keep a romantic line in a movie that is essentially a parody on romantic fairy tales. 6/10 is a mark that approves of the film, but it certainly does not belong to the same class as Toy Story 2."
236,Shrek,10,5 December 2001,"""Shrek"" * * * * *","""Shrek"" is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.The film has alot of humor and imagination twisting the fairy tale world and poking fun at certain fairy tale creatures.The film does have some odd humor which some people fail to see.""Shrek"" takes everything that we know about fairy tales and turns them around with humurous results.Unlike certain films that I have seen,""Shrek"" is by far a great movie and is worth watching.Mike Myers,Eddie Murphy,John Lithgow and Cameron Diaz provide the voices and the CG animation is excellent.""Shrek"" is a movie that shows us everything that represents a good time at the movies."
237,Shrek,10,3 December 2001,"""Shrek"" is everything that a great movie should be","I was a bit skeptical before I first saw ""Shrek"".  It had so much hype from everyone I knew who had seen it, and whenever I encounter that, I immediately think the worst.  Most films of that nature do not live up to that hype...but this one not only lives up to it, but far surpasses it.  This is a must watch for anyone in need of a laugh. Big green ogres?  A fantasy land peopled by so called ""fairy tail creatures""?  Yup, it happened.  And why not?  The viewing public was overdue for a film such as this, and it got what it had coming. The computer animated film is virtually flawless to the eye, and the storyline is both clever and utterly hilarious.  The cast of all star voices backs up state of the art technology to create a film that will live on for years to come as a great masterpiece and breakthrough in the art of filmmaking.  Really?  Yes, really really!"
238,Shrek,,3 December 2001,They've actually done it!  A movie with *genuine* magical powers!,"Concerning ""Shrek"", I have just this to say:  ~~  Imagine yourself to be a person who's been really, *REALLY* sick for a really long time.  Imagine that you usually spend thirty minutes or better just cranking up the will power to get up out of bed.  This is on a good day; on a bad one, it might take an hour and a half or even longer.  You watch LOTS of movies, cartoons, etc., trying to get your mind off your illness (the symptoms are sort of hard to describe; something like a cross between Siberian Death Flu and Radiation Poisoning, but less pleasant).~~ With VERY few exceptions, your reaction to just about all of them is absolutely zip -- nada.  Some cause reactions too scary to talk about; like the kind that produce a ""Right -- that's it.  Where'd I put that gun?  On second thought, forget it.  I feel too bad to look for it"" sort of response.~~ Then -- one *particularly* not-nice day -- the kind you want to take back to the store and get a refund on -- a friend drops by unexpectedly and hands you a VHS of ""Shrek"".  ""Check this out,"" says he.  ""Got a couple of snickers out of this last night.""~~ Within, say, twenty minutes, you find there's a serious possibility your friend has just uttered the Understatement Of All Universes.  Your first clue of this comes when you are laughing so hard that your cola beverage goes down the wrong way and you're interrupted for a bit, trying pretty hard to find some spare oxygen somewhere.~~ After you've finished un-choking yourself to death, and rewind a bit to catch whatever you missed while the suffocation thing was going on, comes the second clue:  Pretty shortly, when you're again laughing so hard you realise you're in serious danger of tearing something up in there permanently, your voice gives a final ""wHAAAAaaaa..aa..."" -- and that's it. You're still laughing; but the only sound you now get is weird, almost inaudible noise -- something like ""Heeerr... Heeerrrr"", while you're rolling on the floor.~~ And then -- it's over.  But guess what ...?  Despite the possibly permanently fragged voice, you are feeling *MUCH* better!!  Better than you've felt in many weeks! ~~ Well then -- cease straining your imagination.  Because that's almost exactly the effect ""Shrek"" had on me... well, not the part about rolling on the floor.  There's not enough available floor space in my bedroom for that, unless I happened to be the size of a laboratory rat.~~ It's twenty-four hours later -- and I'm STILL feeling better!  But -- er -- there's just one thing:  ""Shrek 2004""?!?  You mean I have to wait THREE YEARS before the sequel to the ONLY movie that has made me feel just a *whole lot* better is produced!?!~~ (Groan)."
239,Shrek,,1 December 2001,Think about it!,Shrek is suburban potty humor at it's finest.  To think that so many people relate to it makes one wonder about the mentality of our generation and what's to come.  Why not take us to a world which we can learn from.Technical brilliance wasted.
240,Shrek,9,30 November 2001,Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting much when I went to see this movie.  And, my initial feeling as I watched the opening credits were that I wouldn't like it. However, very early on I grew to like it.  The movie irreverently pokes fun at nearly every childhood fable.  I enjoyed that.Funny movie.  See it.  Even if you don't know the Muffin Man."
241,Shrek,,2 December 2001,a delight from beginning to end,"`Shrek' is the ultimate fractured fairy tale, a film that manages to simultaneously honor and lampoon the conventions of its genre without becoming smug or condescending in the process.  For while it is sardonic, `Shrek' is never cynical, so confident and assured are its makers in establishing and maintaining just the right tone for a revisionist exercise such as this one.  The film certainly conveys a modern sensibility, yet it is a gentle sort of iconoclasm that allows us to enjoy the more conventional aspects of the story (the happily-ever-after ending, for example) even as we are laughing at the obvious absurdities contained within them.   
The revisionism begins with Shrek himself, as unromantic a figure as has ever earned the title of `hero' in a fairy tale adventure.  For Shrek is an ogre, plain and simple, an ugly, cranky, decidedly standoffish beast who wants nothing more than to rid his swamp of all the classic fairy tale figures (Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, The Three Bears, The Three Blind Mice et al), who have been consigned there by the dastardly Lord Farquaad, who is attempting to purge his land of all those bothersome folkloric personalities.  To earn the deed to his land and thereby have authority to evict the squatters, Shrek agrees to go in search of the beautiful Princess Fiona, rescue her from her dragon-guarded castle, and bring her back for Lord Farquaad to marry (thereby earning the latter the legitimate title of Prince of the Land).  Of course, every valiant hero needs his own wisecracking sidekick to accompany him on his journey and Shrek finds his in Donkey, a companion whose sardonic humor serves as both a thorn in the side and as a source of moral inspiration for the unlikely, often socially backward hero.It is hard to overestimate the seemingly boundless originality, ingenuity and creativity that have gone into the making of `Shrek.'  Here is a film that can truly be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  Children will revel in the glorious animation and the assorted lowbrow comic antics of Shrek, Donkey and even Princess Fiona, while more seasoned adults will delight in the sly in-jokes, bawdy innuendoes and clever anachronisms that pour forth in amazing abundance from the mouths of the characters.  There is never a dull moment, since the writers, William Steig and Ted Elliott, and the directors, Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, always seem to have new and clever tricks up their sleeves.  Donkey, in particular, is the most amusing and endearing sidekick since the Robin Williams genie in `Aladdin.'  
The script pokes marvelous fun not only at the whole fairy tale mentality, but also at the romanticized conventions of medieval life.  There are jousting knights, damsels in distress and an Inquisition-like rounding up of all those caught demonstrating any proclivity for the supernatural and the magical.  So much seems to be happening throughout the course of the film that a second viewing is surely in order, just so one can catch all those delicious details that might have slipped by on the first go-round.  (The gingerbread man interrogation scene is particularly hilarious).Despite its tone of sardonic playfulness, `Shrek' is, happily, not afraid to indulge in a bit of heartwarming sentimentality at times.  The romantic feelings that develop between the Princess and the Ogre are genuine and heartfelt, made palatable by all the flippancy going on around them.  In fact, Princess Fiona is very much a modern heroine, shrewd, matter-of-fact and able to roughhouse with the best of the boys this strange land has to offer.Special note must be made of the superb voice work, which is largely responsible for bringing these extraordinarily well-delineated animated characters to life on the screen.  Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad) and, especially, the brilliant Eddie Murphy (Donkey) all turn in bell ringer performances.In every area of the filmmaking process, `Shrek' excels like no general audience film since `Toy Story 2.'  Like that earlier work, `Shrek' provides audiences of all ages and all types with the joy that comes from seeing a superb idea superbly executed.  `Shrek' is an intelligent, witty and imaginative family film.  Be sure to catch it.  Films like this don't come along very often."
242,Shrek,,1 December 2001,Doesn't reach the greatness level,"Shrek is an interesting concept but it lacks viewer satisfaction. The lampoon idea is excellent and I found myself laughing at some of the jokes, a dig at Disney?Shrek as a whole is not entirely satisfying, by the end, I was perplexed that the picture was missing a strong character/villain conflict.
Never mind the shortcoming of the villain, Shrek is all about lampoons and the jokes. The picture is entertaining, and Donkey steals the show. Voiced by Eddie Murphy, he brings energy to the character. Mike Myer's Shrek is slightly underwhelming. The CGI is quality, really fantastic.Pixar is still leading the computer animation, Toy Story adventures will be difficult to top. Shrek was a decent effort, but needed  meat to fatten the story and the villain."
243,Shrek,,29 November 2001,Hilarious!,I was going to watch this video with my friends. Lord Farquad has banished all of the fairy tale creatures from his palace. Shrek and Donkey must go on a quest to rescue Lord Farquad's sweetheart Princess Fionna. Gingerbread boy's leg gets eaten by somebody. I cannot believe Shrek makes the most disgusting dishes. But eventually Shrek and Donkey become real good friends.
244,Shrek,10,26 November 2001,Pleasantly surprised!,"I was so surprised by Shrek when I finally sat down at watched it; it was witty, edgy, and highly entertaining.  I watched the movie with my entire family over the holiday and everyone, aged 3 to 54, loved it.  How often does that happen?! The music, the emotion, and the twisting of fairy tale were all wonderful."
245,Shrek,10,19 May 2001,Excellent movie that shows people are more than skin deep,"liked the way it showed that words hurt and heal.  showed that first impressions are not always accurate.  showed that the ""beautiful people"" can be ugly in character.  taught that sometimes we start out doing something for the wrong reason (rescue the princess) and benefit by the effort."
246,Shrek,6,26 November 2001,A Narrative of Torture,"A cute gingerbread man's legs are severed. An innocent frog and snake are blown up like balloons, tied, then set free, to (presumably) gradually die. A would-be king is eaten alive by a dragon. Rats are roasted on a barbecue pit. This is NOT for children, and barely for adults, all leading to a predictable conclusion. The film would be lucky to get one nomination from the Academy (for visual effects). ""Shrek"" is drek."
247,Shrek,6,26 November 2001,umm...,"Well, I usually love this type of film and I love Mike Myers. There was something missing in this movie and kept it from being great. I can't forgive it for that. I mean when I laughed which was maybe twice they were really good laughs, but that isn't enough to make a movie great. Granted every movie doesn't have to be a masterpiece, but when you obviously put so much time into something you should make sure it's complete. I think part of the problem was Eddie Murphy as the donkey. It was very annoying and just not funny at all....period. The three blind mice were great. The basic plot was good. They should have spent more time with the relationship between the ogre and the princess. Throughout the movie I was either grossed out or shocked. Hopefully the next one will be better, but I'm not going to hold my breath."
248,Shrek,,25 November 2001,"Great Movie, But Not Top 100","I watched this movie the other day on DVD and was quite impressed.  The animation, humor, and voices were all outstanding, placing together a fun, entertaining, and adventurous movie.  But come on! This is not one of the top 100 movies of all time! How is it that this film surpassed the likes of ""The Graduate"", ""Glory"", and even ""E.T"", is beyond me.  Animation should not exceed the achievements of real actors and actresses, otherwise we may eventually find cheaper substitutes in animation to replace them (""And the Academy Award goes to.....Shrek!!!"").  It was funny, but not hilarious; it was exciting, yet I was never at the edge of my seat; and it was romantic, but I never felt an emotional connection nor a warm feeling for the animated kiss at the end. Sure it great for kids and had adult humor, but its the same basic story most animated features have; nothing extraordinarily original.  So while it is a great movie, I believe it should not be in the Top 100 placing some real classics in its shadows.  7*'s out of 10."
249,Shrek,10,25 November 2001,I give Shrek a 10.,"Shrek is the kind of laugh-out-loud-throughout-the-movie movie that I haven't seen since The Emperor's New Groove. The CGI is great and the characters fit perfectly into their graphical environment. Shrek combines comedy with love, drama, and action. But the best part of the movie, in my opinion, is Donkey. Eddie Murphy played the part exactly how it should have been. At first, the movie is somewhat slow, and I was thinking about never watching it again. Then, after the parodies of scenes from select movies, I decided it wasn't so bad. Shrek's parodies, or maybe they are better called innuendos, don't poke fun at anyone, they just remind you of the other movies and how they now fit into this one. I continued to watch and started to like it better and better. Then the extended ending came. Hilarious! Some imaginative minds put this part together! If you don't like the movie at all, at least watch it for its special ending!"
250,Shrek,,20 November 2001,pretty good but....,"I liked Shrek, but there were some things that bothered me.  The use of ""Allstar"" and ""I'm a Believer"" were good for ""tie-ins"" (Burger King commercials and selling the video) but didn't fit the movie well.  The WWF-style wrestling scene was just plain dumb (there isn't anything remotely clever about pro-wrestling).  There were alot of good points - it looked great, the voices were super and the fairy-tale jokes had the perfect dark humor (gingerbread man).  Whether you like Disney movies or not, it's difficult to do a 'fairy-tale' type movie without being compared to them and/or inadvertently borrowing from them (the three fairy witches)."
251,Shrek,5,20 November 2001,Really too much hype,"Sometimes, people get carried away with the hype... I think that is what happened here.  There were some funny moments, but nothing that was just jaw-droppingly, side-splittingly hilarious and amazing.  So, computer animation is getting spectacular, big deal!  It's bound to happen.  I'd rather see a kid with a Commadore 64 and a more original / clever script. There would most likely be a superior product.Plus, what is with the ""Scottish-accent"" and Mike Meyers???  So, the rumour is, after the entire movie is done he thinks it would be better with a Scottish-accent???  In ""So I Married an Axe-Murderer"" and ""Austin Powers"" it was used effectively, but it's obvious he doesn't have such a grasp of the dialect to use it for an entire script.Eventually, a computer is going to be able to produce something which looks identical to real life.  Will that be a good thing?  What will be amazing about that when you can film the real thing?  Call me a spoil-sport.5 out of 10"
252,Shrek,,19 November 2001,A fun and hilarious 90 minute romp!,"""Shrek"" ***1/2 out of ****""Shrek"" is the best movie (animated or otherwise) to come out of the summer of 2001.  Mike Myers voices Shrek, an ogre who just wants to be loved. Eddie Murphy is his side-kick JackAss that never shuts up.  Cameron Diaz is the fussy damsel in distress.  John Lithgow is Lord Farquad, the pompous villian.  Take these great talents and add high-spirited adventure, some off-color humor, and some of the best animation EVER and you have one helluva fun movie. MG"
253,Shrek,7,20 November 2001,Entertaining For Youngsters And Old Folks Too!,"I watched Shrek for the first time on video and certainly would recommend it. However, it is not without some flaws.  It starts out with one hilarious moment after another but then settles into  a simple story of two friends, Shrek , voiced by Mike Myers and his new found friend the donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy going on a journey to rescue a lovely maiden stuck in a castle guarded by a fire breathing dragon.   Murphy really stands out and has most of the funny lines.John Lithgow is the voice for Prince Farkward, a power hundred midget with a mean personality.  The music was an odd mix of oldies and newer rock tunes. Not effective for me but then I'm an old timer myself. I would not hesitate to take children over the age of 8. No younger! Some scenes would be scary for young children. Still, Shrek has some tender moments too and some worthwhile lessons about life. I recommend it but wished  for a little more."
254,Shrek,8,18 November 2001,Clever send up of Disney,"I enjoyed Shrek, but as I watched I could almost hear Katzenberg saying, ""take that, Michael Eisner.""  This thought particularly hit home as they approach the castle of Lord Farquar.  Still, Shrek has a good enough story and effects to make the satire do what good satire should do, stand on its own.Oddly enough, at times the satire is more of an homage.  The mirror's solo evoked not only a certain 60's-70's game show, but Robin Williams' Aladdin performance (and while the mirror was clever, Williams' performance does not suffer in the least in the comparison).  Of course the Beauty and the Beast references are rampant, and again, while the Shrek twist is welcome, the original (well, the Disney original) again well withstands the test of mockery.The tone of Shrek is that pioneered by Rocky and Bulwinkle (TV show, I did not see the movie) and used to good effect in the Princess Bride.  Enjoy this bit of clever, and occasionally poignant, satire."
255,Shrek,9,19 May 2001,You'll Shriek with Delight,"Simply put, `Shrek' is a masterpiece.  The story is engaging and very funny.  It features frequent jabs at movies such as the matrix -- but saves its most biting satire for parodies of `Walt Disney' movies. There are jokes about long line ups at the Magic Kingdom -- and the unusual living arrangement between Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.`Don't worry -- she's not easy,' claims the magic mirror. This wonderful script is brought to life by the fantastic vocal talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow.But what sets ""Shrek"" apart from all other films before it, is the ground breaking computer technology that brought it to life. ""Shrek"" is a quantum leap forward, with photo realistic 3-d backgrounds, and characters that seem like living cartoons.  If there are flaws in this movie, I can't find them!  `Shrek' is a great film for adults and children alike, and it's certainly worth checking out."
256,Shrek,10,18 November 2001,One of the best family films ever !,"Easily one of the best films of 2001 - if not the best, and one of the greatest animated films of all time. It really did feel like ""Snow white"" for the new generation.The CGI/Animation graphics are FANTASTIC. With the best scene being the rail bridge sequence over to the castle near the beginning. All of the characters are immediately likeable and a lot of thought has gone into the entire world that Shrek takes place in. I am definetly looking forward to Shrek 2 in 2004 if it's anything like this one.A real winner.10/10"
257,Shrek,,17 November 2001,One of my favourite movies,"OK, when I saw the trailer for Shrek i was a bit apprehensive, but as I saw more of the movie and family and friends saw it and gave it wonderful reviews, I got together a group of friends to see it. We're 13, and you wouldn't think a cartoon would appeal to us, but we loved it. In fact we went to see it again straight after. The storyline is great, the jokes are laugh-out-loud and the characters are charming, adorable (Donkey!) and interesting. Eddie Murphy as Donkey is hilarious (Hell no, I don't want no parfait!), Mike Myers is really great (Dead broad off the table!) and Cameron Diaz is wicked as Princess Fiona. A great movie. Go see it!"
258,Shrek,10,17 November 2001,A total brilliant! A MUST SEE!,"Just to add my 2 cents: This is the funniest, the most beautiful, the most ironic  3D anime movie I've ever seen. One of my all time favorities! I was wondering: has the donkey been created after Eddie Murphy agreed to voice the part or before? :) The script, the making, the humor are unbelievable good. Definitely A must See, A must Buy, A must rent! I have already bought it the first time it appeared on the online stores. And one last thought: Let Mike Myers do the voice parts only, this is the only way for him not to humiliate himself any more with idiotic roles such as in ""Austin Powers"" sequels."
259,Shrek,10,17 November 2001,I never thought..,"..that the movie would be so fantastic!! I read a lot reviews about this movie, and they were all saying that it was fantastic, but I never thought it was soo good. The characters are made soo realistic, and the voices behind them. OHH my god they are good, especially Eddy Murphy, he made me laugh all the time!! My advice to all of you out there, rent the movie, or buy it, just see it!! And I recommend buying/renting it on DVD, it makes the movie even better. There is no more to tell about this movie.I give a 10Regards"
260,Shrek,,18 November 2001,Well worth a look,I just watched this movie today and I must say that this is one of the best animated movies to come along in a while.  I thought it was very funny and exciting throughout.  It's very easy to see why this movie did so very well in theaters because the story was so well written and the animation is superb.
261,Shrek,10,18 November 2001,"Funny, Entertaining and Completely Original","It may be too early for me to tell, but Shrek just may unseat The Little Mermaid as my all-time favourite animated films. I benefited from knowing very little when I went to see the film. But when Shrek tears out a page from a Fairy Tale book to use as toilet paper and then goes pleasantly about his day to Smashmouths ""Allstar"", I knew I was in for a treat.All four lead voices in this film are brilliant, but none more than John Lithgow as the diminutive Lord Farquaad. Farquaad is about three feet tall but does not seem to realize it, as if Lithgow was not told during the recording. But he is evil and arrogant and perfect. One of the best animation voice-overs ever. The choice to go with Mike Myers scottish brogue is the only thing in the film I would question, but then I cannot picture the lovable Shrek any other way.The plot is very simple. Shrek is enlisted by Lord Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona from a dangerous dragon. Pretty standard fairy tale fare. Shrek agrees to do so in exchange for getting his beloved swamp back all to himself. He is joined by Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy who provides almost all the laughs. Shrek does not know that Farquaad and Fiona both have secrets.To tell anything more would be silly. The plot has little to do with this film. It is a visual feast with every inch of every frame jammed with colour and action.  It is also packed with adult injokes and movie references. I counted more than 20 and the IMDb lists even more than that. And after a film of laughs, jokes, adventure, emotion and fun, the best scene comes at the end as the entire cast rocks out to I'm a Believer. (Maybe Disney needs to get the message that original sappy ballads that are written to win Oscars just aren't needed).If you are one of the few people left on Earth who have not seen Shrek, do so right now! What a treat! A true gift to movie goers and proof that animation is not Disney's monopoly.**** out of ****."
262,Shrek,8,13 November 2001,"Not your typical ""fairytale"" - wonderful","I loved the appereances of the ""other"" fairytale characters. It was very interesting.My daughter is now 2 and a half and she too enjoyed the movie. But I'm not sure if I'd feel comfortable her watching it when she's a bit older.Loved the ending. Happy but not typical."
263,Shrek,8,13 November 2001,Lots of laughs and fun for those who normaly wouldn't like an animated movie.,"""Shrek"" directed by Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson, and Scott Marshall is a magnificent animated movie.  It stars Mike Myers(Shrek),  Eddie Murphy(Donkey),  Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona),  John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad),  and many others.  This comedy is rated PG and lasts for an hour and a half but you'll be laughing long after that.This is a story of acceptance.  The comedy isn't complex,  the jokes may not seem to be to original but they definately make you laugh out loud. Shreck is an ogre,  a mythological creature who is fierce and ugly,  who's solitude is disrupted when a talking donkey wanders into his life.  As soon as this happens a group of other mythological creatures happens to come along and take residence in his swamp.  Furious with his life being interrupted, Shrek decides to go to Lord Farquaad and demand that his swamp return to the way it was.  When he arrives Lord Farquaad gives him an offer.  ""Rescue the Fair Princess Fiona and I will return your swamp to the way it was.""  On his quest Shrek and Donkey encounter mishaps and merry men which will make your stomach hurt from all the laughing. I don't care for animated movies that have dancing and singing,  but I couldn't pull myself from this movie.  I enjoyed this movie and think you will too."
264,Shrek,9,12 November 2001,"I don't know what to say(really, really, really good)","Are you depressed? This movie is the cure! Shrek was a much more deep film than most people realized. I don't care what anybody says about it. This movie really helped me. Just look at Shrek and donkey they both had their problems, especially Shrek who was emotionally damaged. This movie helped me to realize that i am who i am and that's the way it's going stay. And it made me feel good about that. It should do the same for you not to mention that it would make you laugh your larynx out. I'm not going say anymore because you need to find out for yourself. Sit down with your family, or by yourself and watch this movie."
265,Shrek,8,12 November 2001,Great fun...,"I really get tired of the movies my kids want to watch.  It was only because I was bored when my kids started watching this the fourth time that I saw it and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Shrek is fun to watch with never a boring moment, and that's what really counts in a film like this.  The story is strong, the actors deliver believable performances, and the flow is excellent.  It even has the occasional adult-oriented joke or comment.  (I loved ""Dead broad off the table"")The only two negatives of this film are that the actual story is a bit short and the animation is not up to the usual Pixar standards.  The story came in too short, so they stuck on the ""Shrek in the swamp Karaoke party"".  This, of course, is a massive hit with my kids who played it about 100 times, but it's not at all part of the story, it's padding.  I would have preferred if they had left it as a fun addition after a full-length film. 
The animation was a bit surprising.  The textures were often very 2 dimensional and shadows were generally wrong.  I wonder if part of this is due to having to reanimate and rerender Shrek due to Mike Myers decision to redo his voice with a (not very good) Scottish accent.But, aside from this minor nitpicks, this is great and fun film.  It's not Gone with the Wind, but it beats the heck out of so much of the garbage Hollywood has been spewing in recent years."
266,Shrek,10,10 November 2001,Hilarious!!!,"This movie is flat-out funny!Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow, and Jim Cummings all did terrific jobs in their performances!However, even though he is the title character, Mike Myers did just an okay job. His Scottish accent reminded me too much of his character, 'Fat Bastard', from AUSTIN POWERS 2. He was pretty good, though.The animation is eye-popping and the script (along with the fairy-tale-spoof theme) is delightful!It something that every age can enjoy: it has enough cute eye-candy and lovable characters (especially 'Donkey') for the little kids and it has well-written jokes for the teenage-and-up audiences. My only complaint about the movie was that it had a tad too much profanity. Swearing in a PG-rated, animated comedy (even if it is a tiny bit) is not cool in my book. It just doesn't seem right.If you like cool special effects and have a good sense of humor, then rent SHREK. You won't be disappointed.My Grade: A-  (***1/2 out of ****)Cast:  Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), and John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad)."
267,Shrek,10,10 November 2001,Great,I really enjoyed the jokes and how it made fun of all the other fairy tales. A very witty film. Hope to see more of this stuff. However... this is a film more for adults than for kids. Many of the of the humorous scenes were violent even by my standards.
268,Shrek,,10 November 2001,"Both me, my wife and our children loved it.","My favourite characters are Shrek and the talking donkey (Simon age 7).
Both our children (who are 7 and 5) enjoyed this film enormously and it was not merely tolerable for adults but actually good fun.The ending was a delight."
269,Shrek,7,11 November 2001,Aside from clever satirical moments script falls flat.,"The satirical value of this film has largely been used by many tohide the slow moments of the film.  This movie has a few veryhumorous moments where it mocks many of the familiar fairy talecharacters.  But the main story of the film, which is a more indirectsatire of typical fairy tale elements, is slow and has uncomfortableinteraction between the characters that make the movie more of atask than a pleasure."
270,Shrek,7,11 November 2001,One word: Hype,"I really don't understand the big deal of Shrek. It's supposed to be this amazing movie because it has done so well and everything about it is great. I saw it on video and enjoyed it, but it really, really doesn't live up to the hype. Visually it's stunning, but that is the only thing that is stunning about Shrek. The message is so overdone and the ending is very predictable. Not to mention that the movie has no plot, and there's nothing to look forward to towards the end. Not to mention the ""choice"" words in the movie not intended for children. Good for kids to watch a few times, but not one to enjoy over and over again."
271,Shrek,9,8 November 2001,An excellent movie,"Although I loved TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE, SHREK did not look too appealing to me when it first came out. Now, not only is it one of my favorite animated movies of all time, it is one of my favorite movies of all time, period. Although it's difficult for me to decide whether I liked this one or MONSTERS, INC. (9/10) more, I think SHREK is slightly better.First of all, the four lead voices in this film are perfect for their respective roles. Eddie Murphy and John Lithgow stood out especially to me. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Donkey. He definitely had the funniest lines in the movie and he easily stole the show. Eddie Murphy, it would seem, is ideal for voice-over work. And John Lithgow is perfect for the role of Lord Farquaad, the stuck-up villain of the film who wants to be king. Lithgow makes him sound evil, but funny at the same time. Mike Myers gave the best voice anyone could have given for the lead character Shrek, and Cameron Diaz can best be described as ""cute"", which is perfect for her character, Princess Fiona.I love the way the story uses all the classic fairy tale characters to make this modern-day fairy tale. The ""beauty and the beast""-like romance between Shrek and Princess Fiona really works, even better than most romance movies I've seen as of late. And of course, this movie has laughs galore! I found myself laughing out loud many times, especially at Donkey, the Matrix spoofs, and the little inside jokes that some of the younger viewers might not understand.This one is definitely a film for all ages. I hope it wins the first Oscar for an Animated Film this year (although I'd be happy if MONSTERS, INC. won, too). I've watched this movie a few times since I bought the DVD a few days ago, and it only gets funnier and better every time I see it.9/10"
272,Shrek,10,8 November 2001,Despite all the talk and hype...,"... I still don't think ANY of it did this movie justice. I try to steer clear of repeated comments but this really is a movie that can be fun for all ages, and speaking from myself, any animation gurus out there can take note of this film as an animation classic. Don't be fooled by the television ads and commercials for Shrek though, it is not nearly as cartoony as they portray. It fits more into the surreal category if anything, mostly because of the great background and character rendering done with CGI. Generally speaking, I would have to say this is now my favorite computer animated movie so far, well above anything Disney has done. But aside from the technical stuff, it has a great plot that kids can love, funny moments, and adult humor here and there, where kids might not understand what is being said and that adults can laugh at like an inside joke. The spoofing of classic fairytales was funny, and the plot itself was simple(uptight king, save princess, fall in love with princess, happy ending) yet had enough originality to keep you interested. And out of all the crap that came out in 2001, this was a great, refreshing film.My only gripe being the marketing for this movie made me sadly overlook it for a few months, and that I was expecting Shrek to be some sort of ""friendly"" ogre.It's a 9.5 out of 10"
273,Shrek,6,7 November 2001,Green and Big,"A bit too many scary or serious movies put me in the mood for something sillier, and this fitted the bill nicely. Wonderful animation starring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow. The story of a grumpy ogre who rescues a princess in return for the deeds to his land from the reigning Lord. He falls head over heels for the princess with some interesting results. A movie that can be enjoyed equally by children as well as adults, but for different reasons. The gags are the same but depending on your age, you may see them differently. If you haven't seen it, I won't spoil the ending for you. Could win awards for it's sparkling animation but that's about all as I'm sure it wouldn't be deemed worthy by the Academy for anything else, though Eddie Murphy playing a jackass was quite superb. Very enjoyable in a throwaway kind of way. Been there, done that, what next?"
274,Shrek,9,7 November 2001,fantastic animation,"I love this movie so different to the Disney, and that is good! This animation picture is awesome, I thought that I would not like it, but after I saw it I loved it, Eddie Murphy is hilarious..he made me laugh so much! Favorite scene is when the cool princess Fiona finds the bird eggs Haha I thought that she would take care of them. anyway, John, who has the voice to the very short king is fantastic! I laughed so much when he got of the horse. Well the movie, story, animation is wonderful. love it //sofia"
275,Shrek,8,6 November 2001,I am speechless See this movie NOW!!,"This, by far, is the most highly successful and one of the top 5 animated movies, and no matter what, you have to see it. Not kidding. Enter Shrek, a stubborn, fat, mean ogre who likes to spend his privacy in his swamp. His. Remember that.No one else. In town, there is a reward for people who have fairy-tale creatures such as the three little pigs. A very talkative donkey runs away from the guards who want him, and meets Shrek, but Shrek does'nt give the donkey{Donkey} a warm welcome. One day, Shrek finds tons of fairy tale creatures hiding at his swamp, and he gets very angry. The creatures tell him that Lord Farquaad forced them to go there, so Shrek journeys to DuLoc with Donkey. The Lord is seeking a princess, named Fiona, so he can be ""king"". When Shrek complains to Farquaad, Farquaad asks Shrek to rescue the princess and bring her back to DuLoc, and Shrek will get his swamp back. Eddie Murphy steals the film, and Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz make a stunning performance. I know that when you look at the cover of this film, you think, ""Oh, not another stupid family movie to waste my money for my kids to go."" But you're wrong. WRONG. Just ask anyone else who's seen Shrek. 90% of them will say ""I loved it."" The other 10% will say, ""I'm not interested in that animated crap. I don't like comedies"" or something like that. I can't wait for Shrek 2 to come. This movie also has alot of inside jokes for all you adults out there. Buy this movie on VHS or DVD, show it to your kids, save it for a couple of years, then show it to them, and they'll say, ""This movie changed the way I look at animation and fairy tales."" It sure did to me, i tell you.  By the way, check out the extended ending on the VHS and DVD, right after the movie {after I'm a beliver}."
276,Shrek,8,6 November 2001,Funny.Much better then Disney!!!!!!!!!!!!,Maybe I would not place this on the 74 on the imdb top 250 films but it´s still hilarious funny both for kids and adults.Very funny voices(Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Mike Myers........)and the film is a spoof on other fairy tales and on Disney to and in the funniest scene of the movie it´s a spoof on the Matrix.4/5
277,Shrek,10,5 November 2001,CG storytelling at its finest,"There seems to be no end to the CG development! Shrek is the present day climax of that development, in terms of technical efforts combined with storability. We are here given a good old-fashioned fairy tale (with an obvious twist!), told with the good heart of a storyteller wanting to entertain the crowd.The movie manages to combine a wonderful voice casting with a good and (incredibly) funny story; a superstory in a 3D-animated environment, a world that exists only in the memory of a computer. Despite this, the technical work is done to so much perfection, that you have no hesitations in believing fully in the existence of the settings and of the characters.We are given the rare phenomenon of a CG romantic story that, within the grounds of a fairy tale, is highly credible. We see the vulnerability of true love in the faces of the hideous ogre Shrek and the fair Princess Fiona, beautifully animated time and time again throughout the entire movie.That the creators of this movie have managed to perfectionize both the process of making an entire environment out of nothing but zeros and ones, the process of using human facial communication in computer animation and use them both so artistically wonderful, is, I find, the highest feat so far within the animation features. You laugh, you cry and you end up sighing sobbingly after 90 well-spend minutes. Shrek is a wonderful, wonderful movie."
278,Shrek,,5 November 2001,Very enjoyable,"I just saw Shrek a couple of nights ago.  I bought the dvd before having seen the movie and I can't say that I was dissapointed.  In fact, this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen all years.  With all the ususal garabage I stuff into my head (night of the demons, return of the living dead, From Dusk till Dawn) I find it refreshing to watch a good childrens movie from time to time.  My one complaint.  After having watched Shrek, I will now have higher expectations for movies like this.  There was some serious talent involved here and boy does it ever show.  I won't go through a plot-rundown or anything but I will rave about the characters a little bit.Casting John Lithgow couldn't have been a better idea.  The guy is one of my all time comedy favorites and no actor alive can make me laugh as hard as this guy.  He is perfect as Lord Farquaad and his role as a stuck up wannabe-king, with a height complex was top-notch.  Let's talk about Donkey for a minute.  Eddy Murphy was funny as Donkey but this is also the sweetest part I've ever seen him do.  It's really hard to believe that this is the guy who always had me cracking up with ""Raw"".I could rave on and on about this movie all day, but it isn't just a ""must see"", it's a ""must own"".  GO out now and pick up the dvd.  It's worth it."
279,Shrek,,5 November 2001,Better than anything Disney ever did!!!!,"How is it that anyone can find something wrong with this film???  It has a wonderful story, great voices from the actors, and great, top notch animation.  A most remarkable triumph!For those who have a beef with this movie, I must say that you either live under a rock so much that you hate what is good, and need something to complain about, or truly good movies fly over your head.   And silly complaints they are!For those who hate the animation....there is something to be said about style.  While Final Fantasy does have more realistic animation, Shrek was still wanting to look cartoonish, while FF attempted to be more realistic in nature.  The producers did a great job in keeping consistant with the look and feel of the film.  It was part of the charm, and kept with its own sense of style.  Remember that a lame piece of doodoo like ""Pulp Fiction"" became a cult classic because of its style.The story was fantastic as well.  A great fairy tale in and of itself!  It mostly trys to show that we shouldn't judge people before we know them, and that looks are not everything.  And yes, Lord Farquaad is picked on for his size alot, but remember that when Shrek first met him, the little guy tried to have Shrek killed, and Lord Farquaad is really a selfish little imp, so I don't think that he made a good impression on Shrek during their first meeting.  There is a lot to be said about one's attitude as well, you know. The point is that the Princess and Shrek fell in love because of who they were on the inside, not the color of their skin.Worth watching over and over. It's smart and witty, with a clever style all its own, and sad to say a story and look about it that seems to be lost on some people.  If one cannot enjoy this movie without looking for something wrong with it, then I truly feel for you, because this is one of the most perfect movies ever made."
280,Shrek,10,4 November 2001,One of the best movies of 2001 & The best animated movie ever,Shrek is a movie that everyone has to love. The animation is awe taking and the story is awesome. Shrek is a tale about the nice guy who gets the girl. The inside jokes in this movie are so funny that they will go over little kids heads. Watch this movie with the ones you love.
281,Shrek,10,19 May 2001,Can't remember the last time I laughed so hard in a theater.,"I think the first thing I need to say is that normally, I don't like toilet humor.  Fart jokes and nose-picking are the kind of things that keep me away from a lot of ""comedies.""  There *was* a lot of that in Shrek, and yet... most of it was funny.  There's such an overall feeling of irreverence in the film that I surprised myself by laughing at that very humor, because it seemed to fit.  Maybe it's the knowledge that you will *NEVER* see a character in a Disney film put out a fire by peeing on it that makes it so delicious.  Speaking of the Evil Empire, I noticed that several reviewers considered the regular stream of Disney-knocking to be a drawback. Personally, those were the jokes I laughed at the hardest.
There are 2 sides to how I feel about Disney, sort of a love/hate thing - I love most of their products, but I hate who they are.  I grew up on Disney animation, and still hold many of their films dear to my heart.  I also lived most of my life within a 2 hour drive of the Magic Kingdom and have spent more than my fair share of time there, so I think I know more about Disney the corporation than your average American.  Frankly, they're a little scary with their, ""You'll be happy, it'll be magical, or else!"" attitude, which is what makes Shrek so funny.  There were sendups of several other well-known and well-loved films, but the Disney jokes were the best. I think you have to love Disney and have a first-hand knowledge of the Disney experience to really appreciate those lampoons to the fullest.
I haven't said anything about the effects yet, but of course they were amazing.  Shrek truly leaves all other animation, not just Disney, in the dust.  It's the first animated film I've seen that really takes advantage of the technology currently available - it doesn't just pan in and out of scenes, it's three-dimensional, and pages crackle and light refracts, and characters move naturally.  It was impressive, especially when compared to the trailer that showed right before Shrek started - Disney's Atlantis comes out in 2 weeks, and it looks like formulaic, flat, 2D Disney.  Disney takes the same amount of time to develop a film, but they're clearly stuck in a rigid design mold - dig up a legend to animate, insert storyline here, drop in cute characters there, get famous singer to do theme song, ta-da! another blockbuster.The final great thing about Shrek was that they turned the typical dreamy animated love quest on it's ear.  As a woman, I'm thrilled to see more and more anti-fairy tales making it to the theater.  Sure, you could say that it's been done, and you'd be right, but it hasn't come near to being done to death as much as the ""typical"" fairy tale love story.  As far as I'm concerned, make anti-fairy tales until the adults want to puke - little kids can use as much reverse gender-stereotyping as possible.  Here's to burping princesses who get involved in their own rescuing!"
282,Shrek,6,5 November 2001,"Somewhat entertaining, with some great moments, but overall a wasted opportunity","Maybe I just went into the film thinking the wrong ideas.  The trailers looked very appealing.  I saw parts of the movie working at the Edgewater Multiplex over the summer and really enjoyed the parts I saw.  But when I finally watched it straight-through, I have to say I was kind of disappointed.  First of all, I thought they could've stressed the idea of spoofing fairy tales.  I think that's what tantalized me most about the film.  I laughed my head off when Lord Farquaa (voice of John Lithgow) looked into the mirror and gave that ""Mirror, mirror on the wall"" speech and the mirror commented on him negatively.  So he calls his henchman and he punches a crack into a small mirror.  Lord Farquaa then continues with ""You were saying?.....""  Now that's funny!  I also loved that little tribute to ""The Dating Game"" where Farquaa had to choose between Princess Fiona, Cinderella and Snow White (who is described as living with seven men).  Then the people in the audience, his knights, start holding their fingers up screaming out who he should pick.  Again, hilarious!  And I have to commend the always-talented John Lithgow for lending his voice to that character, because he absolutely cracked me up and I don't think any actor could've done a better job.  In fact, though he was the villain, I was hoping he would have a bigger part in the story.  The story mainly focuses on Shrek and his pal, Donkey.  Eddie Murphy provides the voice of Donkey the donkey, and he's funny at times, but after a while he gets obnoxious.  I was amazed by the abundance of crude humor.  I know it's nothing compared to the average Farrelly Brothers movie, but how many parents are taking their children to see their flicks?  The opening scene alone is filled with gags involving farting in the water, taking a mud bath and spraying spit all over people's faces.  I don't see how a film like ""Road Trip"" gets panned for using gags like that--and often in a funny way--yet this movie gets rave reviews by critics everywhere.  There's always a certain way to deliver a crude joke, and it's hard to deliver it adequately when trying to appeal to children and keep the PG rating.  Kids will most definitely laugh at every crude joke in sight, but adults will probably roll their eyes.  Even at an hour and twenty minutes, I felt the film dragged quite a bit. They could've cut a few of those Shrek-Donkey interactions and concentrated more on plot.  I liked the movie, but not as much as I thought.  But if parents are looking for something tolerable that they can watch with their kids--without putting on a fake smile and pretending to enjoy it--then ""Shrek"" is not a bad choice at all.  My score:  6 (out of 10)"
283,Shrek,,2 November 2001,I saw it 3 times!,"This is great! Kids will love it, and so will everybody else, as it has jokes for everyone. If you think fairy tales are sacred, you might be in for a little shock, but if, like me, you just love animation with a sense of humor, go for it!"
284,Shrek,9,4 November 2001,A smart & great piece of entertainment,"Shrek, has to be something for everyone. With the most amazing animating ever seen, this is the recreation of another world.Myers, Diaz, Murphy( In particuliar) and Lithgow are first rate. This flim caters for adults and children, and is perfect family viewing.9/10"
285,Shrek,10,1 November 2001,Very good,"I was very pleased with watching this film. It left a nice feeling within me having had a good time watching it. There is not many films that I can say that I would happily watch again and again, however this film I can.The second time around I watched the animation more detailed and I was very surprised by the amount of detail, shading, prospective and animation. It was top notch and I applaud the artists for the 10 of thousands of man hours they put in, well done.Can't wait for the sequel."
286,Shrek,10,29 October 2001,I was laughing the whole time,"I hadn't heard much about this great movie until i watched it, but I'm sure glad I did :)Shrek, the poor Ogre is so cute, with the flapping of his ears, not to mention Donkey who always have a witty comment about everything. This movie is filled with great characters, made come to life by an incredible cast.This is a must-watch-movie for all people between 1 and 101 :) Go watch it on the big screen, Ogres are meant to be huge ;) Even if you ""don't like cartoons"", you'll love this one, it's so much more!"
287,Shrek,10,26 October 2001,A terrific movie for kids of all ages,"Once upon a time, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers). Shrek liked the quiet life in his swamp, until Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)evicted all of the fairy tale animals from his Kingdom. The animals move into Shrek's swamp, which he is not happy about. So he and the fast-talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) visit Farquaad to work out a deal: Shrek will rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon, in exchange for taking the animals back.While spoofing every fairy tale from Three Blind Mice to Three Little Pigs, and taking numerous shots at Disney, Shrek's message is not lost. One cannot always see beauty from the outside. I haven't seen a movie this funny in years. Bring the kids! I'd say 4 and up. There is some mildly crude humor, but little ones won't get it anyway."
288,Shrek,6,25 October 2001,Okay.  Worth a watch..,"It's not a bad movie.  There are some funny parts, but fart jokes just don't do it for me.  What in the world is so hilarious about passing gas, for crying out loud, besides it being utterly embarrassing? 
The animation by Pacific Data Images is first rate, although does not hold a candle in comparison to the scope, effort, and complexity that was placed in Square's ""Final Fantasy"".  As for story, I've actually found the story in ""Final Fantasy"" to be more touching and more involving than the story of ""Shrek"".  Don't get me wrong, ""Shrek"" has a decent story, but it's not quite as elaborate as ""Final Fantasy"".  (In ""Final Fantasy"", you may have to watch the movie a second time to get it.  It is hard to follow, but it introduces a level of intrigue that makes it more interesting.  If you can actually understand the story clearly, then it actually feels far more powerful than what you would originally think.) - Reinhart"
289,Shrek,10,19 May 2001,One of the best kids movies of all time!,"Shrek has to be one of the best movies of all time, especially for kids. It's up there with E.T.Shrek's got some in-jokes for adults to keep things interesting, and the computer graphics are the best in a theatrical release so far.  The cinematography is top notch, and ground-breaking for an animated feature.Rumours are that they are working on an Imax 3D version of this film, which would surely be the best Imax movie ever produced.Highly recommended... 10/10"
290,Shrek,,24 October 2001,I laughed the whole way through!,"My sister and I went to see this show about two months after it had been released, so the theater we saw it in was one of the cruddiest quality.  Did that spoil the content?NO!I had no idea it would be so hilarious!  I have no idea how they made a donkey, of all things, look like Eddie Murphy.  Or how they made some of those shots with people look real.  Computers are incredible, aren't they?It is a great parody on Disney.  I have been waiting on one of those for a while.  They have them on everything, but never has there been a spoof on Disney.  Well, ha!Go see it.  It is hilarious and has humor for all ages.  Oh, two notes. One, there is no animal abuse in the show.  Two, I loved the bullet-time..."
291,Shrek,10,23 October 2001,One of the best movies ever produced!!!,"This movie amazed me.  It was funny, smart, entertaining, and best of all, it was clean.  By clean I mean that I could watch it with my friends and family and didn't have to be embarrassed or sickened by violence or perversion.  This movie had none of that stuff.  It was just good clean family-oriented fun.  If anyone of you have been searching for a great movie to take your family or significant other to then this is the one.  You'll go away feeling good.  Definitely worth the money to go and see or rent. A+++ for Mike Myers on this one.  Why couldn't his other movies be just as good and clean?"
292,Shrek,,21 October 2001,The greatest fairy tale never told.,"This is by far the best animation movie I have ever seen.The movements and landscapes are extremely well made and the animation is super smooth. The story is really funny and you can see that it is made for people in all ages. The story combines many different fairy tales and it very untraditional. I found the movie very entertaining even though I usually dont like animation movies.You also find some great actors who have put their voices on the characters,to name a few:Eddie Murphy,Cameron Diaz,John Lithgow,Mike Myers All I can say is that this is a fun movie with a original story."
293,Shrek,9,19 October 2001,"If you don't like this, you must be DEAD.","I saw this movie last night, and I have to say it is the BEST animated movie I have EVER seen.  The technical aspects of the animation are simply perfect.  Disney thinks it has the edge in animation.  Well, Dreamworks has been working VERY hard to take that edge away, and I think with Shrek and Antz, it has done that.  The characters look life-like without losing any of their fanciful characteristics.  The background characters and the scenery are simply fantastic.Now for the characters.  Shrek is simply outstanding.  He IS alive.  He is NOT that ugly, and in many ways we sympathize with his situation.  Picking Mike Myers to be his voice was a perfect.  The donkey named Donkey is another great character.  He's the main jokester and Edie Murphy makes him come alive.  The relationship he develops with the dragon is just TOO funny. Princess Fiona is not like any other animated princess we have ever seen. She quite a bitch in many ways, but we also sympathize with here situation. And, King Farquod is just outstanding.  Being voiced by John Lithgow was another perfect decision.SPOILER!!!!!!!!This movie has SO many in-jokes, and pokes at Disney that it is hard to know where to begin.  All the Disney characters in the movie are in the public domain, anybody can use them.  There is Snow White (and the dwarves), Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, the Three Blind Mice, and countless other Disney characters represented here.  Perhaps the FUNNIEST scene is when Princess Fiona sings in the forest with a blue bird, and sings at such a high pitch, that the bird explodes.  Then she cooks up the bird's eggs for breakfast.  VERY funny stuff. 
Anyway, as you can see, I just LOVED this movie.  It is most certainly an adult animated movie, but it can be enjoyed by anybody including little kids.  This is mainly because of Shrek himself.  He is VERY lovable from the very beginning of the movie.And a message to Disney.  You WILL NEVER do a movie like this.  Your rules simply restrict your ability to do movies like this."
294,Shrek,5,10 October 2001,Cute but Disappointing,"I have to say that I had great expectations for this movie, but it let me down.  There, I said it.  I was expecting something exciting, fanciful and adventurous, instead I got a rehashed beauty and the beast style romance which a five-year-old could have written in a weekend.  The fart jokes, which comprised most of the humor in the movie, were just plain annoying. They did get in a few good digs at Disney, but that was the only thing going for it.  Oh, and what's the moral of this story?  It's ok to be ugly, just as long as the person you marry is also ugly."
295,Shrek,9,19 May 2001,Fairy Tales like you've never seen before,"This Dreamworks tale about an Ogre's adventures is a fairy tale like you've never seen before.  The all-star cast of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, etc. provide non-stop laughs.  The animation is incredible.  Highly recommended. Keep in mind that this one is not for the kids."
296,Shrek,8,2 October 2001,Shouldn't Disney be doing this? *MINOR SPOILER*,"Dreamworks heads for the jugular once again! Is there no stopping them? While Disney (I'm not counting their work with Pixar) try to tap into the zeitgest, Dreamworks are setting the trends to follow, and are upping the ante with each film: If it's not Antz, it's Shrek, if it's not Shrek, it's Gladiator, What Lies Beneath, Hannibal...They may not all be classics, but they each have something to offer above standard Hollywood fare. Shrek just has literally everything: a heart-warming ending, excellent set-pieces, a superb soundtrack (Murphy's I'm A Believer rocks, and I can never get tired of All Star) and pure hilarity (""The Muffin Man?"")Keep up the excellent work, Dreamworks!"
297,Shrek,8,29 September 2001,Deconstruction,"** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **I didn't expect anything when I saw it. I just unfolded it like a book. And, like a book, the movie starts, as a fairytale, with tales of princesses and princes. The score to go with it is glorious and epic. Then, the coup: the score transforms into ""All Star"", and the main character gets out of the bathroom where he was reading the book. The spirit of the movie is like this everytime: a complete deconstruction of the fairytale genre, with a fantastic finesse and sense of humor. Of course, the fact that the entire movie was generated in mainframes is one more hat to take off. But, although we could have a showcase of computer achievements, they didn't do it that way: they kept the technical details at one side, and focused on the bits and touches that make this movie a joyride. Its structure is the simplest possible: the universe of action is very limited, but this doesn't mean that the story is limited too - we really don't need no more than we have. And the film charms us in the most subtle ways. I could start complaining that the USA do commercial movies and that the american cinema is just a big business, but there is a reason why we see all those sitcoms, and watch all those movies: there are too good jokes to be left unnoticed. ""Shrek"" is no exception, the movie is full of touches that fit right on all the spots. This gives place to a very funny movie, with distinct characters that will make you laugh in their own ways. And as a family movie, ""shrek"" couldn't be better: kids will follow its simple plot and have a lesson by the end of the movie. Adults will marvel at the in-jokes and at the fantastic things computers can do these days."
298,Shrek,8,29 September 2001,delightful!!,"Shrek is a delightful comedy from the makers of Antz. using the same trick of featuring very popular voices from the movie world, that they used in Antz, dreamworkz have woven a comedy that is immediately appealing to one and all.the movie might be a bit of a landmark, in probably being the first animated movie to be a farce. the movie has spoofs on not only famous movies, but also many fairytales.Shrek though goes beyond just that. the movie is funny in its own right, eddie murphy as the fast talking donkey and mike myers as the grumpy ogre are extra-ordinarymild spoiler ahead!!the scene in which the ogre suggests that ogres are like onions while the donkey suggests more palatable dishes like the cake & parfaits is extraordinarily funny. eddie murphy is jus perfect for the donkey :)this is a movie that kids and adulst will enjoy equally well. the movie is refreshingly different from the regular hollywood staple fare.an entertaining 8"
299,Shrek,9,28 September 2001,a real nice film for everyone,sure the moral of the story is plastered at the end but this really doesnt matter as to not like this film you would have to be emotionally dead. this really does have something for everyone with a story that always manages to stay on the right side of being too sweet for its own good. great animation and really good voice overs (although i thought that mike myers at one point was doing an impersonation of ewen mcgregor!) plus a nice soundtrack.a great laugh and an uplifting film even for cinephile cynics like me..
300,Shrek,8,27 September 2001,"a good laugh combined with a ""healthy"" kick of romance","every once in a while one's heart (even the one of those, who exalt their sense of cynicism, like me) needs a positive kick of overwhelming warmth and a dose of ""love conquers it all""-delusion. and if you are just a bit allergic towards those just-a-bit-cheesy-seen-one-seen-them-all romantic comedies, then why not please this need by the prism of humour. ""shrek"" is lovely cartoon - not only for its really stunning 'reallifelike' animation but for its sense of humour and some of the truely ""human"" moments. my personal favourite was the eddie murphy's voiced donkey - maximum points for choosing him to do the job."
301,Shrek,10,24 September 2001,Lovable with a great message!,"I just saw Shrek for the second time yesterday afternoon, and was again struck by the delightful whimsy of the film, but most of all by the wonderful message hidden behind the fun - beauty comes in many varieties, and friendship is all-important. I'm hoping for a sequel!!!"
302,Shrek,10,18 September 2001,"Great animation, good and varied humor","Thorough attention to details of animation and outstanding work with the facial expressions of the characters.A somewhat unorthodox mix of different fairytale creatures produces some great jokes and hilarious situations. Humor for all ages, even though some punch lines are more for ""grown-ups"".A new side of Mike Myers - his performance pleasantly surprised me. And of course Eddie Murphy - he is always good (loved him in Mulan)."
303,Shrek,,15 September 2001,I'm quite disappointed.,"Shrek is a simple attempt to spoof classic fairy tails. Or so Dreamworks would have you think. It's a quite thinly guised jab at Disney, and it all too often comes off as mean-spirited in that sense (the ""compensating"" joke comes to mind). Some of Shrek's jokes are funny, but frankly, they try too hard to make a joke into a scene, rather than incorporate it. I saw half of the jokes coming from a mile away, too. The ending was also anti-climactic and a little ""harsh"". You'll probably like it, but I don't know why."
304,Shrek,7,21 May 2001,"not bad, but, jeez, settle down, folks","The animation is pretty terrific in Shrek, but the story is fairly straightfoward, marginal stuff.  I don't know why critics and audiences trip over themselves to overpraise stuff like this and Chicken Run (which was a smidgen better than Shrek), and God, don't get me started on Spy Kids, Leaving Las Vegas, or L.A. Confidential.  I simply have to think that the audience isn't as saturated in film and plot as I might be, and critics are so desperate for anything worthwhile that The English Patient starts looking really, really good.Okay, so that's getting more personal than I usually like to be, so let's get on to the movie itself.  Naw, let's just summarize: if you can grab a matinee and keep your expectations in check (the Emperor wears SOME clothes), this is a decent amusement.  That's about it.  I burst out laughing once, precisely (a certain scene involving a bird and its nest of eggs), and caught a few grins here and there.  Word has been spread that the delight of Shrek is that it constantly does the unexpected; I simply can't agree.  That sort of mania happens precisely once (see above); everything else I saw coming before I'd bought my ticket.  It does its thing fairly well, but the main attraction here is the rendering process."
305,Shrek,9,13 September 2001,It's In the Background,"I want this on video so I can watch parts of it selectively. The story is fun, the animation sensational, but seeing it only once in a theater didn't allow me time to scope out all the sight gags. I loved the background images, the schtick that Shrek does because he is an ogre and as gross as they come. But it went by so fast. Since I saw a stage version of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I have thoroughly enjoyed films and plays that have a bunch of significant action going on around the characters that are currently being focused on. The ""real"" plot, so to speak. The fairy tale world that is the setting of this animated joy, is what I really want to see. These characters, who are parts of lots of little stories, go about their daily business, running from big bad wolves or being left to follow bread crumbs. Meanwhile Shrek, being a kind ogre, must put up with the constant pleas of the fairy tale populace, who make nuisances of themselves.Eddie Murphy's donkey, of course, is the most soul testing of them all with his excessive verbiage and quick wit. Nothing ever enters his brain without immediately going to his mouth. This is a fun film, and even if it does go for bathroom humor, it done with great aplomb!"
306,Shrek,9,12 September 2001,"We're lovin'it, lovin' it, lovin' it!","Loved this film.  Thought the humour was spot on.  My favourite bits had to be when the lady sang to the bird and it blew up and she gazed adoringly at the eggs.  I thought - aw - she's going to try and hatch them, but cut to next shot and they were cooking.  I must be sick.  I also loved how they made floaty baloons out of the frog and snake.  Again, my mind must be a bit dodgy but I couldn't stop laughing.Dearie me!"
307,Shrek,10,9 September 2001,Great Movie,"This movie was quite good! Very well made, funny and enjoyable! I recommend it! It could have been even funnier and maybe not so predictable in the end, but, still, quite good! Go see it!"
308,Shrek,,8 September 2001,Anti Climax!,"When i used to watch animated movies when young ,like Beauty and the Beast the best part used to be the ending when the princess kisses the ugly beast and he becomes a prince! But this movie doesnt come up to those expectations.I was totally disappointed with the ending."
309,Shrek,9,5 September 2001,"Finally, a fairytale for grown-ups!","The great thing about this movie is that it's packaged as a kids film when in reality it's anything but. When I first saw the trailer for the film, I thought it would be a cute, funny little family film. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The great thing about this movie is not only the great comedic talents of the stars (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow) but also the message that lies beneath. In the age of beauty magazines and models, we're programmed to think that beauty is on the outside. What Shrek teaches, brilliantly, is that beauty is far more superior if found on the inside. What a great lesson for everyone to learn. I was thrilled to hear that Academy will start a new category this year called the Best Animated Feature Award. I have my fingers crossed that the Academy will remember this delightful little film come Oscar time."
310,Shrek,9,5 September 2001,Definitely worth the time!,"It is rare to find a movie where the entire family, of me, the father and 3 kids ages 10-17, walked out the theatre laughing.  Shrek has something for everyone. As long as you know your fairy tales, esp. Disney ones, you will find it a lot of fun."
311,Shrek,,19 May 2001,Mike Meyers' manages to be funny with one of his four characters,"I am a Canadian.  I do NOT think mike meyers' characters are funny.  Mike, YOU are funny. Linda Richmond, Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Scottish...voice, are not.  Through no fault of his own mind you.  Mostly through a combination of Hollywood and the general public's constant impressions stretching an amusing bit way past the breaking point.  I hate you all.Anyway, ""Shrek"" IS funny.  There is little else I can say.  It's funny, go see it.  Eddie murphy is hilarious as the talking donkey, Donkey.  Mike Meyers' scottish voice that he does, is...funny.  I can't believe it, but I can't think of a voice more suited for this character.  It is spot-on. John Lithgow is amazing as well as the over compensating lord farquaad.So the voice acting is great.  The animation quality is amazing as well.  I am not a big supporter of CG animation, give the good old 2-D cartoons any day.  But this is amazing.  A great primer for ""Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within""  which I eagerly anticipate.  High quality animation is what gives the many sight gags in this movie credibility. (See Cinderella and Snow White Bitch-Slapping each other at movies end.)So kudos to everyone involved.  I'm out of time...8.5 stars! -Matt"
312,Shrek,8,3 September 2001,Great movie for kids and adults,"This is a good laugh this film, especially thanks to Eddie Murphy's sidekick donkey. His funniest performance in years. Donkey kinda looks like Chris Rock when he smiles don't you think? Anyway the mood for this film is set up from the start with Shrek sitting in a swamp farting. Disney it ain't! I give it 8/10"
313,Shrek,8,2 September 2001,"Very strong characters with great voices, especially the DONKEY","The best and funniest character for me in this delightful movie is the DONKEY! The animation with all his facial expressions and gestures is great, and Eddie Murphy did a fantastic work, giving him the perfect voice. I never felt so emotionally attracted by animated characters like in this charming movie. SHREK, Lord FARQUAAD and the DRAGON are as well very strong characters, the first two also with well-fitting voices. Furthermore there are very fancy dialogues, a lot of droll details, surprising ideas and some funny insinuations regarding the main competitors and another famous movie...Check out the DONKEY, it's a must see! 8/10."
314,Shrek,7,5 September 2001,Ugly is beautiful,"This story is another one which explodes the myth that ugly always goes with evil. Shrek is the ugly ogre who tries to disguise his golden heart behind rude manners and mood. Like any other being rejected by society he reacts accordingly. But his rudeness is finally melted first by a talkative small donkey who imposes himself as his friend and then by the love of the ugly beautiful princess. Even the dragon, another evil monster, is converted to goodness by love. This half funny half tender episode of the love between the she-dragon and the small donkey is another ingredient that makes this tale a wonderful story where all the traditional characters of almost all the children's fairy tales are also present though only for a short while turning it into some kind of revival of all those tales. The computer animation technique is almost perfect and serves here a good cause."
315,Shrek,10,31 August 2001,Brilliant,"Utterly brilliant film. I don't remember when was the last time I laugher this heartily at anything. Technically, it looks spectacular in just about every way imaginable, but the icing on the cake are the actors. Go on, I dare you to watch the movie and _not laugh_. Betcha can't do it - I know I couldn't."
316,Shrek,7,31 August 2001,A contemporary The Beauty and the Beast,I saw Shrek with my five years boy who was charmed by the story (tender moments between the donkey and the dragoon have been very much appreciated). I was charmed too. It is magical and very clever. The story is layered for different levels of understanding and even if a child hardly understands certain hints (f.e.: the notice during the wedding or the signals for tourists of Dulac)enjoys the atmosphere and perceives the hilarity of the situations.A good film for children and adults.
317,Shrek,7,29 August 2001,Delightful family entertainment,"I was sort of expecting the typical Hollywood-packaged fare reminiscent of the new turn we've gotten in the _Star Wars_ movies, but trusted the IMDb ratings enough to watch it in the theaters.  I was pleasantly surprised. A delightful fairy-tale that works for both parents and children.  (After all, SOMETHING's gotta be there for the adults to endure an hour and a half in the theater with screaming kids.)  Don't be bothered by all the CGI animation that's gotten its (sometimes rightful) bashings these days. Just sit back and enjoy the comedy and sweet storyline.  I came out of the theater with a big smile on my face and maybe even a tear in my eye (though I'd never admit it!).  If you don't mind the screaming kids, pay the $5 (or whatever) to watch it.  Watch it eventually, in any case.  A hearty, solid 8 out of 10."
318,Shrek,6,28 August 2001,not so nice,"Too much publicity, i heard and read it was a bit transgressive and, nope, for me it was more a film thought to annoy Disney than to really please the people paying for seeing it. Some things were funny, sure, but i was expecting that the script was more worked, but it was only a simple hope. A bit disappointing"
319,Shrek,10,3 September 2001,An absolute topmovie,"Believable and complex characters, a really original story, filled up with good jokes (many are too hard to understand for children), including tons of suspense and romance - this is a masterpiece !Without any problems it raises to the level of the best movies ever, including the other anime supermovies 'Toy Story II' and 'Chicken Run', or movies such as 'American Beauty', 'Titanic' or 'Matrix'.A topmovie. Maybe the best movie of the year. Absolutely recommended !!"
320,Shrek,7,31 August 2001,"A Hilarious Movie, Though It Has Some Mixed Signals","""Shrek"" is a laugh-out-loud, incredibly funny movie that manages to savagely shred the saccharine-sweet Disney film formula throughout most of its scenes.  Inexplicably, though, it suddenly embraces that same sweet Disney formula as it draws to a close . . . becoming, in many ways, exactly like the films it professes to mock.  ""Shrek"" tries to straddle the line between savvy adult-based humor and sweet family-friendly humor, usually succeeding, but failing miserably in certain spots.  Apparently, the strategy of aiming the film towards both kids and adults worked -- if judging from box-office revenue is any indication, `Shrek' was wildly successful -- but the quality of the film is dropped a notch or two by the occasionally awkward blending of adult satire and child sensibilities.  ""Shrek"" is still a very, very good -- and very, very funny -- film, but it could've either been a classic adult satire or a classic kid's movie, if only the producers of ""Shrek"" had fully committed to pushing the film in one direction or the other, instead of just compromising to appeal to the masses.""Shrek"" is the story of a lone ogre (aptly named, well, ""Shrek"" -- and voiced by Mike Myers) whose major goal in life is to live in solitude in his beloved swamp.  This goal is somewhat thwarted by the ruler of the kingdom, Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), a diminutive, evil tyrant who is forcing all the fairy tale characters in his kingdom to relocate to Shrek's swamp.  Shrek, unhappy with this relocation program, makes an offer to Farquaad -- he'll find Lord Farquaad a princess, which will allow Farquaad to get married and become a King.  All that Shrek wants in return is his swamp to be made like it was before --empty. Lord Farquaad accepts Shrek's offer -- so, along with his loquacious sidekick Donkey (voice by Eddie Murphy), Shrek begins a quest to find a true damsel in distress -- the lovely Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz).With the possible exception of the ""South Park"" movie, never has a film managed to so gleefully and successfully tear apart the Disney tradition of animated musicals as well as ""Shrek"".  Scenes are set up in the traditional Disney manner, then shredded with such razor-sharp wit and flair; it's amazingly funny.  The humor ranges from over-the-top (Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode) to the wickedly subtle (the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White: ""She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled . . . she's not easy."")  ""Shrek"" veers wildly between loving reverence and sneering disdain for the traditions of Disney animated films -- the reverent scenes will most likely appeal more to kids, while adults will definitely appreciate those of disdain -- but regardless of the tone, the structure and the direction of ""Shrek"" is usually incredibly funny.  It doesn't hurt that the cast of voices adds immeasurably to the film, either: Mike Myers plays the ogre Shrek with an oddly peculiar but funny amount of patience and practicality (I also suspect he only agreed to the part so he'd have another venue for his outrageous Scottish accent); John Lithgow is perfect as the pompous, overbearing Lord Farquaad; and Cameron Diaz manages to bring just the right amount of outrage and sweetness to Princess Fiona -- I found her to be the best character in the film.  Personally, I found Eddie Murphy (as Donkey) to be the most annoying character in the film -- true, he is very funny, and has some of the best lines, but he's a little too much to take at times.  The first third of the movie, he was brilliantly funny; the second third of the film, only mildly funny; and by the last third of the film, just irritating.  I don't fault Eddie Murphy at all for this, but I do fault directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson for not toning the character down.The main fault with `Shrek', though, lies in the fact that it tries to appeal to two distinct audiences.  It's not that such a feat can't be done (Disney's ""Aladdin"", actually, does this flawlessly), but that ""Shrek"" juggles between the two audiences so poorly.  For example, one of the ""big messages"" being delivered to children by this film is that appearances don't matter, that people shouldn't be judged by how they look . . . and then a significant amount of time is spent ridiculing Lord Farquaad's small stature.  What gives?  When the two aspects of a film like this -- the child aspect and the adult aspect -- can exist simultaneously and separately, the results can be wonderful.  ""Aladdin"" is a prime example of this, as are nearly all of the Chuck Jones-directed ""Bugs Bunny"" cartoons of the early 1950s.  When the aspects start contradicting each other, though, it's confusing, and not very funny.  As it affects ""Shrek"", the contradictions aren't enough to significantly drag the film down, but they are quite noticeable, and they do cause the film to stumble.  (And another thing . . . okay, a minor rant . . . please, enough with ""The Matrix"" parodies.  They're officially now like all those stupid ""I'm so scared"" Blair Witch parodies .. . not even remotely funny.  Stop beating the dead horse.) 
Regardless of the mixed messages, there's no denying that ""Shrek"" is a very clever, funny movie that will no doubt be entertaining for both children and adults.  There will be a few moments, though, when kids will be utterly puzzled by what's occurring in the film . . . and other moments that will have adults gagging from the nauseating sweetness.  Still, ""Shrek"" is very, very good, and in the end, maybe that's all that really matters.  It's certainly better than most standard Disney fare, and is still the best animated film of 2001 . . . not too shabby, huh?  Grade: B+"
321,Shrek,,28 August 2001,Was a good movie,A good movie overall. Adults shouldn't get too bored bringing their kids. Nice modern fairy tale that most people will enjoy. i give it 6.5/10.
322,Shrek,10,19 May 2001,Pretty Good,"I thought Shrek was a good movie. It had awesome animation and an awesome cast. The one thing it lacked was a bigger plot. It was original. However, I think they made up for it with its humor and the animation. Overall, Shrek will rule the hearts of many movie goers. Both young and old."
323,Shrek,,27 August 2001,Silly Waffle,"I really enjoyed Shrek, I'm quite amazed that it made a G rating in Australia. But I guess children wouldn't see much of what was hidden below the surface.Anyway, I'm only filling out the form as part of a usability review of IMDB for a uni course I do...Have A Nice Day"
324,Shrek,,27 August 2001,Brilliant frivolous romp.,"Amazingly introverted look into the metaphorical metaphysics of surrealism, takes the abstraction of temperamental melancholia to astounding new heights of fancy.Shrek is a great flick."
325,Shrek,,30 August 2001,"Not bad, but not skreking with exitement.","Oh my god! This movie is so funny I can't stand it! Ha ha ha, no I really can't. I am laughing so hard I am going to burst me tummy, really I am! Ha ha ha haha ahm. Really people, reading all those reviews you'd think this movie came with a hand that stretched out of the screen and literally tickled the audience. Well, I have to give it to them, the idea of this backward movie was cute, predictable, but still cute. But it was not THAT funny. It was, of course, here and there and everywhere, but I can think of just a couple movies that are funnier. When I say fun I mean in your face screaming at you sort of fun that you can't help but notice, not the delicate, or sarcastic, or witty sort of fun that sinks deeper. In other words this movie is just the sort that will gather attention world wide and, surely, success. If you see the cover, you can bet you know if you like it's sort, and if you like anything like it, then watch it at least once. If you have a big disgust for American comedies, stay away."
326,Shrek,,25 August 2001,Everyone gets something out of this movie,"Like many animated features of the past, the storylines is layered for different levels of understanding. We are given the obvious and the not so obvious. A mixing of fairytales modernized for the new generation, that all can enjoy."
327,Shrek,6,24 August 2001,"Hypocritical ""Shrek"" is too caught up in its own arrogance to be thoroughly entertaining fare","I've never been a fan of computer-generated films (i.e. the Toy Story series), because, to put it bluntly, it lacks any semblance of soul, as opposed to traditional hand-drawn or stop-motion animation.
Then again, I may be biased; I saw ""Chicken Run,"" one of the best animated films ever made, 31 times in the theater and it was worth every cent.
Still, there's a difference between the painstaking, repetitive process of drawing frames or moving stop-motion puppets in such minute increments and instead just sitting and clicking a mouse, letting the computer do 99% of the work.No matter how you look at it, though, what really matters in the end is the color green. Both movies turned huge profits for DreamWorks, grossing over $350 million combined in the U.S. and making Jeff Katzenberg look pretty darned smart for bidding adieu to Disney years ago.But, in this reviewer's opinion, ""Shrek"" doesn't hold a candle to CR in terms of story and characterization. No doubt the graphics are terrific, but it doesn't make up for the surprisingly weak plot.Visually, it's very stimulating, with an abundance of brilliant colors in every frame; nothing ever looks pasty or parched. The impromptu romance between a huge, lovesick dragon and the wiseacre Donkey, who is easily the film's greatest asset despite his lack of laughs (""Shrek! I'm lookin' down!"" and ""I'm makin' waffles!"" are some of his best lines), makes for a humorous subplot.However, the story of our heroes, Shrek and his sidekick donkey  simply known as, well, Donkey  attempting to rescue Princess Fiona from the dastardly Lord Farquaad in an attempt to rid Shrek's homeland of exiled fairytale characters, quickly becomes an afterthought in favor of potshots, self-indulgence and, at times, just plain mean-spiritedness.""Shrek"" rips off so many sources of modern pop culture that it would make Puff Daddy proud. For a film that is supposedly set in a Dark Ages-like era, it's an anachronistic paradise.It's not so much the ripping off that is bad, though; it just seemed that no attempts were exerted in making any of it look somewhat original.
Mike Myers brings his Scottish accent out of mothballs (temporarily retired following the terrible ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"") for the portly, self-centered, Lou Grant-like reclusive ogre, who is now the most famous green creature to hit the big screen since Kermit the Frog and who has a weird penchant for eyeball dinners and outhouses.
That's right, the latter opens up the door for the usual bodily function jokes. And apparently the filmmakers couldn't wait to get at it; the first comes during the opening credits. (Side note: It's not smart to include the voice cast in the opening credits either  this goes for any animated picture.) Things certainly do not get off to a good start when we are also subjected to Smash Mouth's ""All Star"" for the zillionth time, but I digress.John Lithgow gives a lively, spirited, and sometimes demonic performance as theer, short-tempered, tyrannical Farquaad, a creep I wouldn't want as my next-door neighbor anytime soon. You listen to that moniker enough times and it begins to sound like a certain four-letter word, considering that this movie is pretty much aimed at the kiddies. Just don't ask the young uns to try and pronounce it afterwards. His character is peppered with familiar yet effective ""short"" gags.Eddie Murphy runs roughshod as the wisecracking Donkey, and perhaps like Robin Williams, you get the feeling that, sometime during production, Murphy was allowed to insert some of his own frenetic, unrestrained material into the script. Sometimes it works, particularly when he's sweet-talking the fearsome dragon, but most of the time it doesn't. (It also permitted a few inevitable ""ass"" jokes to worm their way into the dialogue as well.) You may be tempted to call me a sourpuss, but he scarcely got a laugh out of me during the course of the picture.Little needs to be said about Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), whose only purpose was seemingly just to engage in a forced romance and a ""Three's Company""-type misunderstanding with our hero, and for the film to include yet another damned spoof of ""The Matrix,"" a gag that is now as old as used toilet paper. This all leads up to a predictable ending that could be seen from a country mile away.By the way, from here on out, anyone who spoofs ""The Matrix"" in any way, shape or form for the sake of a cheap laugh should have their eyebrows removed with Krazy Glue.We also must endure five minutes of tiresome WWF-style antics as Shrek takes out an army of knights in a wrestling ring, which he caps off with a Hulk Hogan-style posedown.But that is all small potatoes compared to what is perhaps the true motive behind this film. It's a shame that Katzenberg chose to turn it into one big piece of anti-Disney propaganda, clearly visible in such scenes as Farquaad's spacious theme park, complete with singing merchandise stands and big-headed mascots, among other things. On the side, it beats the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" moral over our heads with the subtlety of a lead pipe. ""Beauty and the Beast,"" anyone?Much to no one's surprise, ""Shrek"" easily made a killing at the box office. Despite its success, however, this film could easily have been a whole lot more, but it's sacrificed in favor of its misguided holier-than-thou opinion of itself. If you want a genuinely enjoyable animated picture with a superior plot, I highly suggest ""Chicken Run"" instead.But if Katzenberg's ludicrous goal was simply to stick it to the House of Mouse, it comes off as hypocritical, since ""Shrek"" goes through all the arduous trouble of borrowing extensively from the competition's product in the first place in a flimsy attempt at sculpting its own commodity. 7/10"
328,Shrek,10,24 August 2001,Wonderful movie...,"This cartoon has everything... - comedy, love, a good story and action. Eddie Murphy as the Donkey i absolutely fantastic. The animation is incredible."
329,Shrek,9,24 August 2001,Funny and clever,"Just this - i never laughed that much in months. Definitely an adult-targeted fairy tale, anyways (not x-rated, just the kind of humor best enjoyed if you are a grown kid). I just adored the way it treats classical tales; if you saw the chirping duet with the bird you know what i mean. Some Terry Pratchett influence, maybe? Great movie."
330,Shrek,,19 August 2001,Old themes well done.,"Shrek is a classic fairytale. It includes just about all of the typical features of such: An evil king, a misunderstood individual, a merry and simple companion that proves to be an emotional savior, a dangerous journey, saving the princess and love triumphant. This has been done so many times resulting in so many cliches, and Shrek includes just about all of them. Even with this classic joy-killer it is still an extremely good movie, but why? I think the answer is: Because it's really well done. They managed to take all of the classic traits and jam it in a movie that still seems new and innovative. The soundtrack is a strike of genius, making the movie seem modern against all odds. The dialogue is brilliant and the lead animated characters personality is brilliant and complete in all of its simplicity. Several scenes had me doubled over laughing, and even in the more serious scenes I still sat there with a headshake and a disbelieving smile because of the sheer brilliance of the new wrapping. My rating: 8/10"
331,Shrek,5,19 August 2001,cold have been so much better,"There were so many possibilities for gags that just didn't appear. Instead of just giving all the lines to the donkey there could have been a great oppertunity to have more fun with the fairytale creatures. Mike Myers voice talent was waisted. And I know its aimed at kids and plot isn't of the upmost importance, but why was Farquaad getting rid of the fairytale folk? I guess it was so he could have his prefect world, but it wasn't really explored. And please, no more Matrix jokes!"
332,Shrek,10,17 August 2001,COMPLETELY CRAZY CHARACTER CAPER,"This is by far the best movie of the year! With the best casting for characters and the best script in ages. This film aint just for kids! its as much for adults aswell. Its comical and innocently suggestive too, a laugh for all the family what ever age! Dont miss the chance to see this film on the cinema! and watch out for my personal favourite... the gingerbread man! SHREK is well worth a visit to the cinema for everyone."
333,Shrek,10,18 May 2001,Made my kid sit still...first time ever! :-),"We just got back from seeing ""Shrek"". Mind you, My wife and I have 2 children, a 6 year old girl and a 2 1/2 year old boy. Our son has never sat through a movie in its entirety in his life, even Disney classics like ""Mulan"" or ""The Emperors New Groove"". Not only did the wife and I thoroughly LOVE this movie, but my son never took his eyes off the screen! He didn't even ask to go potty, which is another first! (and no accidents on top of it!) All they (the kids) talked about on the way home was how much they loved the movie. Even with my son's SEMI-limited vocabulary, he was a non-stop chatterbox RAVING about the film. FOUR STARS from the Parks family!!!   ****+"
334,Shrek,10,16 August 2001,"Brilliant animation, great music, good story",I took my 6 year old to see this and we both loved it.  He danced and sang his way through 2/3 of the movie and I sang along (under my breath of course) too.  The donkey and the dragon made a wonderful couple.
335,Shrek,10,19 August 2001,"""A wise Cracking Donkey""....it works for me","A funny film for all, except it would go over very young kids heads. The film is full of fun, even ""Charlie's Angels"" get a mention, lol.Myers, Murhpy, etc,etc work well together. Its 90 minutes worth of fun ,anyway you look at it..... Graham Smith"
336,Shrek,8,17 August 2001,Best Movie of 2000,"Forget about the ape movie, Pearl Harbor flick ... this movie delivers.  Not only is the movie worth watching over and over again, I'm hoping they release the soundtrack of Donkey singing On the Road Again.  It does slow down towards the end and take the obvious route, but they make up for it with a spirited and funny Monkey's rehash.  If you're going to watch one film this year, you must not get out too often ... but still, watch Shrek."
337,Shrek,8,15 August 2001,Great!,"When I went to see this film I thought I´d be kind of bored, as I am almost all the time when I go to see ""children movies"". However, I found myself unable to stop from laughing and absolutely enjoyed myself!! I think the plot is very original. There are so many little details through the movie that I saw it twice, so I could notice everything. I loved the part when the little bird exploded. I sing in a choir, and I know that when the sopranos sing too high-pitched, my ears seem to explode!"
338,Shrek,10,15 August 2001,Absolutely Hilarious!,Shrek is one of my favourite movies! Shrek is an absolutely hilarious movie that will keep you laughing so hard you are going to wet your pants! This movie is one of the funniest movies I have seen and the cast is awesome! Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers are great!
339,Shrek,9,13 August 2001,Not Necessarily Disney. Could Exist Without,"This was a very funny movie. Good for all ages, one I will buy.One comment I must not agree with is that this movie would not exist without Disney. Do we not forget that most disney movie's are derived from child-hood fairy tales?  Although I do think the motive was their, and I do enjoy most Disney Animated movies, I think this movie could have come to life without the obviously opposing companies films.A Wonderful Movie to sit and enjoy, no matter how predictable it was. Keep in mind that this was made for all people, and not all the little ones will be able to guess the endings."
340,Shrek,10,15 August 2001,I'm sure you've heard this enough times already but you are going to LOVE this movie!,"All I have to say here is that I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard through an *entire* movie.  Mike Myers is a genius!I will add this.  You'll appreciate ""Shrek"" ten times over if you've been to Disney World enough times for it to have eaten your brain.  Take the sad case of yours truly..."
341,Shrek,10,12 August 2001,"Simply Brilliant, One of the Best Animated Comedies Ever!","Shrek is a brilliant movie, it's animation is stunning and shows how much technology has changed throughout the years. The story is brilliant and well thought out. The voice overs are brilliant and the one-liners are a riot. Shrek is a definate must see for all the family.I was a bit surprized by the fact the word 'crap' was used. But its hardly noticable because the donkey talks really quickly. Everything about Shrek is brillaint and I have no complaints about it.Good Points: Voice overs, Animation, Plot, Story, loads of movie referencesBad Points: Its a tad too shortIf you like Shrek try: Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Monsters INC, Final Fantasy: The Spirits WithinOverall Rating: 10/10"
342,Shrek,10,12 August 2001,The Best animated comedy to date,"The best animated comedy yet made, for not only adults but children as well (or vice versa).  Admittedly it would be difficult to bomb out with the cast of talent playing the voices of the lead characters, but the animators have ensured a perfect match between fantasy and reality here that will be hard to beat.  If you think Toy Story or Toy Story 2 is the best in the genre - watch this and be prepared to change your mind."
343,Shrek,9,11 August 2001,You ARE beautiful...,"Though it's said to be the first pure computer graphics created animation(""Toy Story"" was not that ""pure""?).  I was attracted by not only the visual effect stuff.  It is amusing by its American-styled humors: like Shrek's saying to the princess that he's a ""delivery boy"".  And what's more important, I like the ending, when the princess said ""I'm supposed to be beautiful"", when the sunset brought her an ugly looking.  Then Shrek answered, ""But you ARE beautiful!"""
344,Shrek,9,25 April 2001,You might like it more than your kids.,"Kids are going to love this film, but I think teens and adults are definitely going to get more out of it.  Without giving away too much, Shrek is a clever twist on the fairy-tales and kid's movies that we all know, wrapped with comedy that's really funny simply because you just wouldn't expect it from a ""kid's film.""  On top of a great story and great characters, the film has a fantastic visual feel--amazing backgrounds and well animated characters.  This is easily one of the most fun films in this genre I have seen in a while..."
345,Shrek,,8 August 2001,I laughed my donkey off,"Great movie although set for a more of the mind of a young teenager rather then a kid. Yet this movie set a standard for amusing cartoonish realism. I enjoyed this movie a whole lot. The voices where superb and the characters carried there own wate through this 3d land. I enjoyed the fact that they combined all of the storybook icons in this movie. It really challenged most fairy tale cartoons due to its twist in plot sequence. Eddie murphy was perfect for the donkey his presence was so intuned to his character i could not of seen anyone else doing it. Mike Myers did a good job as shrek although i would of loved to see the late chris farley present that roll as he was suppose to. I enjoyed the theme, colors, laughter, and dialoge as if i leaded into time and became a kid again. I felt glued to my seat when the end came my collegues had insisted we should leave but i was planted and couldent move. A true epic in this new realism that maya graphics produce i give it an award winning applause and hope more of the nature of movies will be released."
346,Shrek,,12 August 2001,Witty,"I won't expatiate, because I'm sure it's all been said by other reviewers here.  This is a palimpsest that works on all levels.  It winks at us, teases us and amuses us. It is funny and clever and makes us care about the characters which is after all what sucessfull movie-making is really about (is not really a secret but it seems that so many writers/directors still haven't figured it out).  As an adult you'll have the denouement figured out well before it transpires, but your kids won't and what's better than seeing their reaction?"
347,Shrek,10,9 August 2001,Awesome animated film with lots of laughs!,"I loved this movie, the donkey reminded me of my dog Binx, and in some parts the donkey reminded me of my other dog Tudi.This movie deserves a ten all the way through. The animation was great and the movie had tons of laugh out loud chatters.10/10"
348,Shrek,9,7 August 2001,Help!!,"A great movie, but I have a problem. I´ve watched it is spanish, and when Princess Fiona belches the donkey makes a comment that is translated in a spanish way... can anybody tell me what the donkey says in spanish?Thanks a lot"
349,Shrek,6,6 August 2001,"boring, predictable","in spite of the stunning animation and the funny trailers shrek turned out to be a completely predictable experience. sure there are some jokes poking at other movies but do they make shrek a good movie? NO!this movie just goes to show that dreamworks may lure you to the cinema with an ugly stinky guy who behaves rude but that they just cannot make a movie that isn't about someone who may seem rude on the outside, but needs friendship and love like all the rest of us (YYUUUCK!) and who will marry his princess in the end and beat the bad guy. he doesn't even really try hard.....it's a dreamworks movie so it just happens all by itself.....dreamworks doesn't even try to make this sorry fact a surprise, or try to weave some additional storylines in (like in toy story where the rex has to learn to scare people, the aliens wait to be 'chosen', and buzz having an identity crisis). you can see the tearjerking end coming hours before the end of the movie (read: from the opening titles)so the donkey is funny.....sure sure.......but for the rest shrek lacks EVERYTHING that makes the toy story movies so much fun, and to a lesser extent a bug's life.for people who havent noticed already: dreamworks has given a new meaning to the word disneyfication. i don't mind anymore if something is disneyfied, as long as they don't dreamworksify it !!!!!"
350,Shrek,10,3 August 2001,I almost Died Laughing!!,"I am what most would call a mixed movie goer.  I am a guy who likes almost every type of movie out there, so when I saw the previews for Shirk, I had to go see it.  Now most the movies being released this year have disapointed me, in one way or another.  But Shirk was the funnest movie I have ever seen.  I have never walked out of a movie theater before and said, ""I am buying this on DVD"" before.  I was laughing so hard in the theater that my wife thought my brain would hemerage.  My abbs were so sore from the laughing.The movie had a clear plot and story line, and is more geared to ages 14 or older.  But since I am 24 I guess I am targeted.  I enjoyed the many one liners and the awsome graphics where unmatched (until Fianl Fantasy came along).  If I had to rate all the movies I have ever seen there are only 3 movies that would rate above Shirk, Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi (but then I am a Star Wars nut).Well there you have it, my opinion."
351,Shrek,8,4 August 2001,"Excellently animated, if slightly overhyped.","No doubt about it, Dream Works is proving to have the innovation and ability to keep up with Disney, but I don't think they've out-done them yet. Don't get me wrong, Shrek's animation is great, and the story is a nice twist on the classic fairy tale, and unless Monsters Inc or any of the other upcoming animated movie really deliver, Shrek will win the first award for best Animated Feature at this years oscars.I think Shrek's story is very original, but for such an original story there are so many things that are unoriginal. Matrix spoofs (we need more of those like we need three legs) Another fat scotish guy played by Myers, another ""All Star"" song and more Disney bashing than you can shake a stick at. Everyone laughs at the Disney bashing, and I laugh at it too, but i fell that this movie almost devoted too much time to Disney bashing. Why would a company put so much money into making a film with great animation and fill the scene by bashing another company? Mr. Katzenberg, please, who are you trying to kid? I see more shrek toys than Atlantis toys at the store, and surely it's only a matter of time before Dreamworks characters are walking around the pretend streets of a theme park.I feel like I'm complaining so much when I really did like the movie, it's cute, I loved the love sick dragon, the little talking donkey, the kick-butt princess and all the character of fairy tales (especially the singing Robin Hood).It's good to see a little competition for Disney after all these years, but Dreamworks still have a long way to go. I feel that Disney's recent CGI like Toy Story 2 and Bug's life are better than this movie, and as far as I concerned while Disney is slipping, they are still the animation kings."
352,Shrek,9,3 August 2001,Everybody,"Actually, there is nothing to criticise about this movie. It couldn't care less about any existing conventions or unwritten laws. Dreamworks Pictures presents a sarcastic parody of Disney's pictures, some kind of an inside fight between the two companies, but the movie hasn't much of an inside joke. There is mainly one winner in this discordance: the audience. We enjoy the playfulness of the screenplay, the cuteness of the characters, who are ugly but sweet (which was impossible before: in cartoons the good and nice and likable ones had to be beautiful) and their hilarious expressions of their faces: a real actor  I have to admit it  couldn't have done better. Only this movie and 'The Simpsons', my favourite TV series, have chosen to use the possibilities animation offers in such a sophisticated way and with such inventitiveness.Lots of anachronisms, concerning music, set-decoration and dialogue give you a wonderfully relieved feeling, and of course, you are laughing all the time. And they are not trying to get everything out of one joke, but present the next one just a few seconds later. Rarely have I laughed so freely so often during 85 minutes. Everybody is going to like this movie: adults of any educational level, and children equally. Maybe the very little kids shouldn't watch 'Shrek' yet but wait till they are older. They might not get some of the really sarcastic gags, which would be a pity. But of course, there are enough jokes everybody is able to enjoy, and some of them are predictable at last  not many. It's fine that Hollywood is gaining some self-irony through its numberous inner disputes."
353,Shrek,8,18 May 2001,Great Fun for all!,"Really a lot of fun!  Finally..... a fun, interesting, witty, well-made animated picture for the whole family.  A lot of the jokes were for adults, but not at the expense of the children's entertainment.  The whole theatre was laughing.  My partner and I and our two kids (8 and 4) were highly entertained.  I say, ""Take the whole family and be amused!""  Well worth the money!"
354,Shrek,6,2 August 2001,Don't believe the hype,"All of the reviews I read in the press of this film said it was not a standard, disney-type animated film. Don't believe it! The film (and the ending) are totally predictable. There are a few laughs in it, but not enough to remove the overwhelming feeling of boredom whilst watching it."
355,Shrek,8,2 August 2001,Now this film I enjoyed...,"As I must now sit through many hours of children's films I mustpoint out that I am very happy when a GOOD one is made... mostchildren's films condescend to children and treat them as thoughthey are fools... however, a good one aims slightly over their headsso they will get the sense that there is something more and canactually grow into the films rather than abandon them to childhoodmemories...Shrek is one of those movies... it does not condescend to itsaudience (children) and thus is entertaining for the adults whowere dragged along as well.  I really enjoyed this spin on the oldfairy tales and was not even particularly put off by the PC 'lesson'that we learn (look deeper than people's appearances?).  I thoughtthat it was a beautiful looking film and really worked hard toentertain both children and adults... I look forward to buying thisone for home viewing."
356,Shrek,10,1 August 2001,Fantastic,"Probably the funniest film I've ever seen, alongside the likes of Blazing Saddles!  I thought Toy Story 2 was the high point of animated movies, but Shrek surpasses even that.  Probably Eddie Murphy's best performance since Trading Places all those years ago, I can't remember hearing an audience laugh as much as they did last Saturday night watching Shrek.
I especially loved the old fairytale references, I think i'll go see it again this weekend.Mike Myers once again involved in a great work... he seems to have something of a magic touch!"
357,Shrek,10,31 July 2001,And I went without little people,"this movie was so good.   I mean, one of my top 10 - I don't have any children but I heard this was a good good film - let me re-phrase - a great film - and I agree.  It was funny and smart and I think will sit well with anyone from 6-100 years of age.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end."
358,Shrek,,1 August 2001,"Funny, Funny, Funny.","With my partner trying to break into the animation industry I have started to follow this movie genre more closely and the trailers for this particular film certainly caught my eye. It looked funny, I was worried that it would be one of those films where all the funny bits were put into the trailer and the actual film turned out to be a bit rubbish. But no, this film is witty, subtle, amusing and even tugs at the heartstrings. I normally cry at every film I see, and I very nearly cried at this one, but with laughter, not sadness. Mike Myers is very good, although the accent is a bit offputting and sometimes doesnt quite seem to fit. Eddie Murphy as Donkey steals the show. Not being a fan of his films I really enjoyed the fact that you didnt get to see his face!!!This film appeals to adults aswell as kids and although I didnt laugh out loud constantly it certainly lifted my spirits, and the people I went to see this film with agreed with me. I was surpised by the way it turned out, and found the ending a bit soppy, but I was happy for Shrek!! This film is funny and I intend to see it again."
359,Shrek,10,31 July 2001,Very funny,"I totally enjoyed this movie. The storyline, although a bit predictable towards the end, was well thought out, and the characters were hilarious. A good thing about the movie was that it sometimes had funny bits in parts you would expect to be serious, e.g. the exploding bird.The movie had me laughing pretty much all the way through. Adults as well as kids can get lots of enjoyment from it. All in all, I thought the movie was great and I give it a 10 out of 10."
360,Shrek,7,30 July 2001,Funny!!!!!!:),This is a funny movie for all ages. Although it wasn't Mike Myers that was the funniest (don't get me wrong he did have some funny lines) but it was Eddie Murphy that was the funniest. And it seems when Dreamworks makes a family film it always seems that there is always adult humor. In Mousetrap they did it. And in this film they did. But the kids won't get it. But they will love the funny cheasy humor that is in it. Another thing they did was take things from other movies that the kids wouldn't get and wouldn't even be able to see the films they brought it from. It has been a few months that I have seen it but the one I remember most clearly is from The Matrix. It's about thirty seconds but is huge and is on the commercials. But it is a great family film.
361,Shrek,,30 July 2001,On par with Toy Story and A Bug's Life.,"Ever since the beloved Simpsons have hit our screens, cartoons have been more and more satirical. Shrek is no expection. The plot could have come from any Brothers Grimm or any other story teller. Princess is trapped in a castle and someone has to rescue her, however this someone is an ogre. He does not save the princess out of love or for courage, but to get rid of extradicted fairy tale characthers from his homely swamp. These characthers are escaping from the evil and height challenged lord. With the help of a street wise donkey, who will not take no as an answer, they head for their adventure. Accept funny one liners, brillant satire and piss takes of famous stories and paroides of post modern culture. This is a funny movie, with brillant stars voicing these characters.8/10"
362,Shrek,,29 July 2001,Absolutely best cartoon ever!!,"I laughed non-stop from the opening credits until the end.  I thought that nothing would ever beat Toy Story and it's sequel but I was wrong.  Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were the best cartoon movies I ever saw.  Aladdin and The Lion King were up there too.  But they weren't as funny as Shrek was.  I just wish Chris Farley would've stuck around to do the voice of Shrek.  He had the movie all done except for a couple of scenes before he died.  I thought he would've done better than Mike Myers.  Eddie Murphy is a different story.  If it wasnt for him, this movie would've been just ok.  The donkey was the best part of the movie, 85% of the time I laughed, it was because of him.  I hope Murphy sticks to family movies and an occasional action/comedy flick.  He was the only thing I enjoyed in Mulan.  He is very talented with voice overs. All in all, Shrek is definitely a movie you take the kids to go see.  Well done."
363,Shrek,10,19 May 2001,Fine Movie-going Experience,"This piece of fine storytelling which is the anti-Beauty and the Beast was a enjoyable experience for me, but not for everyone. Several disgruntled, disappointed kids, they and their parents expecting gosh knows what, left the theater crying and one in particular with the remains of her dinner all over the floor. From that response you'd think they'd just seen the kiddie version of the Exorcist! Oddly enough they had no problem with the Mummy Returns a few weeks ago. Obviously, sadly, Shrek can not even begin to do that well in the box office and it's a shame since this is the best writing to come out of a Hollywood movie since Gladiator (take that as you will). Advice to parents, teens will appreciate this more, not because of its gross factor (which has been exaggerated by the press), but because of its ""layers"" as Shrek himself said and message to all those out there who will never look like movie stars. Young children won't get at all and they'll leave with tears in their eyes. Consider this your warning, parents."
364,Shrek,5,30 July 2001,Self-referential fairy-tale - innovative animation,"Latest technology renders this animated feature more ""lifelike"" than any previous efforts. On top of that, it takes a sly dig at fairy tale films, particularly Walt Disney. Shrek, the main character, is an ugly ogre who only wants to be left alone. Events lead him to a quest to rescue a princess. Tongue in cheek humour throughout raises this fairy tale way above the average. Unfortunately I'm not into fairy tales, even self-referential ones."
365,Shrek,9,28 July 2001,A Terrific Film!,"Shrek is the best movie I've seen all year by far, and the best ever computer animated film even better than Toy Story 2. This movie is just halarious, one joke after another, and they're not the kind of jokes only kids will laugh at. I loved all the characters, my favorite being Eddie Murphy as a loud mouth talking donkey. This movie is always entertaining, always fun, it's funny, it's exciting, it's somewhat deep, it's a great movie. I give it a 9 out of 10."
366,Shrek,8,27 July 2001,"Nice, happy and innocent...","I loved to watch this movie, it was so soft!!!... You know what I mean? I was use to watch complex movies, showing terrible things about our society! On this movie was different, I came out of the Theater with a happy smile on my face. It was very nice watching this movie! My idea was to watch Eddie Murphy's character, Donkey. It was just like him!!! I love it! Steven S. is doing a fantastic work at his ""Dream Works productions""!Congratulations Mr. Steven!!!!!"
367,Shrek,10,27 July 2001,"Wonderful, humorous, original and third-dimensional characters",This animated movie ranks with the best cartoons.  It is so well-done that one forgets that it is animated.  The characters are well drawn and seem like real people.  A change from the usual contrived fare which is usually predictable. It also delivers a message but without knocking you on the head with it or seeming preachy.  It blends the old nursery rhymes and fairy tale legends with today's humour.  A treat for young and old !  I will see it again and hope to purchase it when available !
368,Shrek,10,25 July 2001,"Stunning animation, great light story","The previews show a cute summer animated film for all children to enjoy. The truth of the matter is that 'Shrek' is not far from the best animated film to this day.  A story that would be enjoyed by moviegoers of any age and maturity level is hard to find, but Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphey, et all have pulled it off nicely.  The animators broke the mold with the quality of 'Shrek''s animation and set a record that would not be surpassed until Final Fantasy.  Aside from 'Shrek''s great light story, it is full of humor, again compatable with a large variety of levels.  I appload everyone involved in this project and hope that the Acadamy does as well."
369,Shrek,,26 July 2001,Now I'm A Believer,"""...And I saw (his) face..."" Yes! Shrek, the most beautiful ogre ever, is truly beautiful underneath. Sure he might be different within his society, but he did not let other people's opinions get in the way.I, a rejected member of society, took a lot from this film. I learned so much from this lovable ogre. (I only resemble him *slightly* you know...)Shrek is one of the better films i have seen in my lifetime, although it doesn't compare to films like American Beauty and Edward Scissorhands and of course the ever brilliant Lost in Yonkers."
370,Shrek,9,25 July 2001,10 out of 10: One of the best comedies ever.,"I'm sure with the some 360 other comments people have sent in, what I have to say has probably already been said.  But, I'll try anyway.Whether or not this movie is a good children's movie is questionable.  With various bad language and some (what I would call) animated gore, I'm not sure if this movie is good for children.  Though, I would say that this movie is extremely funny.  With jokes aiming at both recent movies and shows, to movies and stories so old I forgot they existed.The music is debatable, but I generally liked how it fit with the movie, and it did.  The voice-actors were well cast, and the story-line was better than I expected it to be.It was, by no means, the best animated movie of all time.  Doesn't really compare to movies such as The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and The Prince of Egypt... but then again, it's just not the same type of movie either.  This is a comedy.  Pure and simple.  It was not meant to be the best movie ever, or win 5 Oscar Awards, it was meant to give you (the people who have seen The Lion King so many times that your sick to death of it) a few laughs.And, for a comedy, it's extremely good.  Some jokes are disgusting, but most are in good taste, and very funny.  I don't go to the theatres often, but I did to see this... and I was not disappointed."
371,Shrek,9,25 July 2001,The best film that I have seen this year (so far),"I love the Dreamworks studios. They are doing something good. Disney studios recognizes this and are trying unsuccessfully to duplicate this, but cannot. Shrek was a departure from the norm, a refreshing entry in the animation genre. I loved the underlying themes that are in it, and the many hidden gems that the kiddies may or may not pick up. I would pay my money to watch it again."
372,Shrek,9,25 July 2001,Wonderfully Fractured Fairtales,"This movie was great!  Not just for kids.  Adults will definitely get a kick out of it too.  I just can't believe where animation is going at the moment. I caught myself (because I AM a computer geek), looking at the animation and being amazed that these characters were CGI and not actors.  All the cast did great jobs, bringing their characters to life.  Without the enthusiasm of the actors and a solid story, the movie would have been just technically brilliant.  This movie took delight in taking the mickey and having fun with established fairytale favourites.  A good, fun time to be had by all."
373,Shrek,9,18 May 2001,One frickin' hilarious movie from start to finish...,"Earlier this afternoon I ventured in to the multiplex to see what Shrek was all about. I had high expectations for Shrek after the  trailers, and I have to say that Shrek surpassed my expectations. This is the summer film that is going to start off the blockbusters (minus The Mummy Returns cause that was a sequel). It is beyond hilarious, has characters we care about and a whole punch of pot shots at Disney that are right on target. And I'm not afraid to admit that me and my friend were the only 15 year olds in the theater cause we had a hell of a time with Shrek. A MUST SEE...9/10"
374,Shrek,10,24 July 2001,"A 'Real' Escape; And A Hoot, Too!","The way 'Disney' gets trashed in this movie is just one of hundreds of great comedy angles! And there's romance, action and a 'tug at the heart' to go with it! All so devistatingly 'real' that I had to do a double-take on Princess Liona to make sure that she wasn't an actual actor superimposed. What more could you want?I wanted to go back and see this movie over and over to catch all the stuff I missed. I still might. But I want to save the money for the video when it comes out. Should be about X-mas (I hope), which would be a perfect time to enjoy this film, again (and again)!"
375,Shrek,,23 July 2001,great animated movie for kids and even for grown-ups,"i saw it twice and always it's better. the best on it is Eddie Murphy as Donkey, he's great i like the scene in the castle. i don't go on animated movies very often but this is very funny and the idea with fairy tales creatures is absolutely great."
376,Shrek,10,22 July 2001,"Amazing movie, amazing tail","Hello,Tonight I went with my friend to spend some time, and ""Shrek"" seemed a nice way of doing it. I would have never imagined that this movie will become one of my old time favorites; For nearly an hour and a hath I had a smile on my face, and I think it was the same for everyone in the audience. I saw how people switched off cell phones simply because they didn't want to be disturbed, and in the first time in ages there wasn't a single ring during the time of the movie, that is for itself a remarkable thing.I enjoyed every minute, and I hope you will too. I gave it a 10, and if I could give more, I would."
377,Shrek,9,23 July 2001,Hilarious,"Animation is getting advanced every time a new animated film is been produced. With Shrek you can see it and appreciate it to the full. There was always a problem that the human characters were not so believable. This film prove that with computer animation they are about to solve this aspect of animated films.Not just the animation but everything in this film is superb. A story that in the world of animation, make sense, move fast,combined with well build characters, which are supported by superb voices who make every character unique(especially Eddie Murphy who is better here than he is in his own films). To the mix you should add some black and politically incorrect humor, some jocks which are aimed at Dream Works' main rival,Disney, and some scenes which show that today films are more close to an animation films than anyone has ever thought it would. The result is Shrek. I found my self laughing constantly. It was simply hilarious. The jocks work in all levels. Some of them are simple others are sophisticated enough. Children and adults will enjoy this film  for different reasons.All in all I highly recommend this film. I had only one objection. I didn't like the forced message which was inserted in the film. In a such politically incorrect film the message looked forced. That's the reason why I gave the film a 9 out of 10. I could live without the message. Otherwise it is a perfect movie."
378,Shrek,,23 July 2001,Who needs Disney anyway.....,"WOW, I want to take that chattering donkey home ! Who cares about good ol' Disney ????? I almost choked with laughter during most of the scenes (line-dancing merry men.....hilarious !) Even if it started a bit tame and childish, it lived up to every dollar I spent on the ticket!  10 thumbs up, even if I only got 2 ! * * * * *  mean green stars out of 5 !"
379,Shrek,,21 July 2001,a brilliant film....,"I think Shrek is a brilliant film!  Overall, I'd give it 9 and nine-tenths out of 10.  Just the little part at the ending spoilt it a bit.  It was kind of the same as Pocohontas (why couldn't she have gone with John Smith? I'm needed here'  barf) because it doesn't end how you want it to. Come to think of it, Fiona (I happen to have always hated that name) didn't look that bad as an ogress! The Gingerbread Man was really funny   poor little crippled guy with a candy-cane  and I'm glad he didn't get cut out of it after his first appearance. Eddie Murphy was hilarious as Donkey (minty freshness? Does that dragon use Ice-White gum or something?)  By the way, that spell-book or incantation or what ever it was, was a real lie  why did it get Fiona's hopes up of becoming beautiful again, then let her down? And why have people complained about Donkey's movements?  I thought he moved just fine!  Shrek himself was great  no more jokes could be fitted into his script!"
380,Shrek,10,21 July 2001,Ton of Fun for Adults!,"Absolutely hysterical! A must see!! Over and over again!!! There's something new to see each and every time you watch this movie. Not that the other actors don't hold their own, but Eddie Murphy steals the movie... perhaps because he has the best writing, but positively because he has the best timing!"
381,Shrek,,20 July 2001,Funny show - get the DVD!,"Possible spoilers : CAUTION!Shrek is a well fleshed out show. As with most other animated films (and comedies, might I add), it is somewhat short at approx 93 mins, but those minutes are packed with laughs the whole way through.If you read further down, you will find lots of people who don't like the show. By and large, ignore them. They are entitled to their opinion, and if you like overanalysing shows, you just might agree with them.However, if you are like most of the cinematic audience of today, who go to the movies for suspension of disbelief, then Shrek will do it for you. I mean, this show has got it all. Mike Myers (and I hate Austin Powers) does an excellent job of portraying the irascible Shrek, who actually has a pretty solid heart of gold. Eddie Murphy is Donkey, and no one else could have played the part so well. Cameron Diaz is a convincing Princess Fiona (and makes a pretty mean ogress too, or could have). And John Lithgow as Lord Farquaard(sp?), well!Don't bring your brains into the theatre with you. Leave them in the cloakroom, and you will find this extremely funny show an enjoyable romp. The humour is biting, and show off Disney/DreamWorks animators at their very best. As has been noted, there are a largish number of take-offs on other films; watch out for the more obvious ones.Overall, a fantastic effort. Kudos to the creative team behind the show. Can't wait to see the 'making' and stuff on the DVD.PS : I thought Shrek and his Ogress Fiona made a particularly good couple. They didn't look ugly to *me*; on the contrary, Shrek was about the most good looking male, and Fiona in both her forms were absolutely stunning. Check out Donkey - he's pretty cute."
382,Shrek,,18 May 2001,This is a must see movie,"There are so few family movies anymore that this one is a must see.  There are moments during the movie that you could forget that what you are seeing is animation.  Shrek has the cute characters for the kids, and the inside jokes for the adults.  I saw this with a group of teenagers and they really enjoyed themselves."
383,Shrek,10,20 July 2001,A must-see,"Second movie I saw where the audience applauded. First was Chicken Run, and Shrek was even better IMHO. Loved the Disney-bashing, the rudeness of Shrek, the graphics, and the anti-cliche story. I only wish the movie was a bit longer."
384,Shrek,7,20 July 2001,"Just what a ""kid's movie"" should be","In my mind, this is what a kids film should really look like.  There's enough to keep the kids entertained, so they don't start to moan, but enough to keep the parents dragged along glued to the screen.Myself, I'm a grown up lover of kids movies. This one really hits the spot. There are no running gags found in other movies, but a regular supply of one liners and surprises, keeping all viewers interested.I'm not a big fan of Mike Myers, but I have to admit, he fitted his character. But, I would have to say that the movie once again should go to the sidekick, played by Eddie Murphy.  As often happens, he gets most of the gags and one liners.  Surprisingly though, for a change, he doesn't actually bring all the attention upon himself, as the sidekick usually does, for me anyway.  The cast makes as many jokes as the character they play normally would.As a film, Shrek breaks the mould, shatters it, and grinds it to dust,  not only are there unorthodox parts (no knight, but an ogre, no sweet princess, but a girl with a mind of her own, and no tall, domineering bad guy, but a wimpy shrimp) but the even mention it throughout the film.To me, this is a spoof of every fairy tale known to man, all put together into a movie.  A must see for children, parents and those wishing they were young enough not to be self conscious to go and see it.  When I went to see this movie, a couple who must have been in their sixties were there, laughing with everyone else.  That really said it all.  A movie for all ages, for once, really does apply."
385,Shrek,,23 July 2001,"A good movie, but three words - ""Fractured Fairy Tales.""","For those of you who don't know, ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" was a section of the classic ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" show which, much like ""Shrek,"" turned classic folklore on its head but did so with a bit more genuine irreverence. Jay Ward and Co also didn't need 90 minutes of expensive animation to do it either.That's not to say I hated it - I'm all for doing it as well as possible, and ""Shrek"" sports top-of-the-line animation and design throughout without any Disney-type modelling on real people (though a key character does look like Tara from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). The script also sports plenty of good ideas and gags about both traditional fairy tales (witness Lord Farquhad's interrogation of the gingerbread man) and modern day culture (including the best reference to ""The Matrix"" ever), the voices are right, particularly Eddie Murphy's donkey (even if it is a retread of his scene-stealing dragon from ""Mulan"") - although after ""So I Married An Axe Murderer,"" ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" and this, I wish Mike Myers would sort out his obsession with Scottish accents - and all the ingredients are in place, but somehow the movie falls short of its goals... not to mention DreamWorks' own ""The Prince Of Egypt.""It might be because some thoughtless person wrote a letter to ""Entertainment Weekly"" which gave away the ending (which I will not do). It might be due to far too many tasteless jokes. It might be because the film tries to have its cake and eat it (and not only in said ending; Shrek may be bothered about his looks but that doesn't stop him making jokes about the villain's short stature). Or it could just be that, like PDI/DreamWorks's ""Antz,"" it's only slightly less clever than it thinks it is, though it happily lacks that film's characterisation flaws.Perhaps the jabs at Disney weren't malicious, but the makers should've copied the Mouse with regards to songs - there are far too many pop songs throughout, including one over the end credits that has ""Future Oscar Night Performance"" written all over it, and they cheapen the film as a whole (especially considering that it already has a wonderful score by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell, of which only one cue is on the soundtrack album). I'd have to say that ""The Princess Bride"" and ""The 10th Kingdom"" mine similar territory to better effect than ""Shrek"" - but not much better. It's a very good movie all round, but not in the same league as ""Beauty and the Beast"" or the Disney/Pixar movies. Mind you, what is?"
386,Shrek,,22 July 2001,A rerun,"This movie is good, but certainly not worth all the accessive amount of praise it has been getting. This film is yet ANOTHER computer animation comedy for all ages. Amusing? yes, the jokes are good, but Eddie Murphy basically repeats the role he played as Mushu in ""Mulan"", except he's a donkey, not a dragon, this one is from Dreamworks, not Disney. I have no idea why Mike used the scottish accent, it does nothing for the film (not like it needed to). The story is creative, and the visual gags are funny, but this movie feels like it could have been done by Pixar, and it is nowhere near the quality of animation as some of their jaw-dropping cell animation films like ""The Prince of Egypt"" or ""The Road to El Dorado"", yeah I know that they are different forms of animation but you think they would keep a similar style. This is a great, funny, movie but nothing really new, and nothing to go ape-poo over."
387,Shrek,9,20 July 2001,Amazing!!!,"I love this one! The jokes are all funny, and that guy Shrek rules! But all my love goes out to the.. Donkey!!! He's unreal! And I also want to give the guys of animation a big 2 thumbs up!! It was beautiful!"
388,Shrek,10,18 July 2001,best laugh we've had in a long time,"Now, my husband is not one to go and see a child's movie, but I did manage to drag him along to see this one-and he was thankful for it...now he wants to buy it on video!I think the best thing about Shrek was the 'usualness' of the characters - everyone can relate to real life ogres and princesses."
389,Shrek,8,19 July 2001,Great entertainment,"This is one of the most entertaining films I have seen this year, if not the most. The landscapes, scenarios and characters are wonderful. The plot is a bit (more than a bit) predictable, but all the other aspects are excellent and the result is a good film. The renderings are at times even better than A Bug's Life's. Some shots really look like they are real. Of course there's a lot to do yet with CG animation. One example is the full-body animations of the characters. The donkey moves pretty well (although not perfectly), but the rest of the characters aren't natural at all. The close-ups are simply unbelievable, anyway.I recommend you watch this film. It's funny and entertaining, and the computer graphics are fantastic.8 out of 10."
390,Shrek,9,19 July 2001,Something for Everyone,I don't know that I'd call it the greatest fairy tale ever told but it certainly is a great animation and entertaining for many ages.I found =no= fault with the film and the animation alone is well worth the price of admission; absolutely outstanding and definitely something that will give most Disney animations a run for their money.This is probably one of the last animations where the audience can tell the difference between real actors and those created on computer.
391,Shrek,,18 July 2001,film for the whole family,"Attention:may contain **SPOILERS**This is one of those special animated films that appeal to a wide range of audiences.Although the plot is all to familar,the vocal talent is superb by Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers in particular.The animation is gorgeous and detailed and the characters fill the movie with clever and often added humour.There are also secondary characters that offer memorable moments such as the little gingerbread man for example and the magic mirror as he tries to sell off a range of princesses to shorty Lord Farquaad.This movie is a cross between ""Antz"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" and is definite must-see for these"
392,Shrek,9,18 May 2001,One of the funniest movies in quite some time...,"This is a great movie for both the little kids and the adults.  The jokes tend to be a little lowbrow (as most of them are these days), but there is some good physical comedy as well.  Don't look for anything terribly original in the basic ideas behind the story, but there are some things that'll leave you saying ""I never woulda thunk it.""  Very funny movie, especially with the potshots they take at Disney."
393,Shrek,,17 July 2001,hey forget fantasia et al .. THIS IS THE ONE,i took my 6 year old granddaughter and 12 year old grand son to see this flick.. i was knocked out .. they were enchanted .. the graphics are just..ace ... but the script was wonderful.. hey old timers out there.. grab a youngster (hopefully related to you ) .. and go see this ... as a scotsman.. mike myers accent is right on the button.. but the whole movie is a sheer delight... LISTEN as well as WATCH...THIS IS NOT A KIDS ONLY JOB...
394,Shrek,8,18 July 2001,Better and Funnier,"This cartoon has so much comical element that i can't stop to see it until the end.The fact is that the characters seem have their own attitude such as the ""Ogre"" and the ""Donkey"" but as i seen it, the supporting cast has better and more funnier dialogue than the main characters. Thumb up for the graphics, face and body expressions, they are real good.Enjoyable movie, one of the best. Well done."
395,Shrek,10,16 July 2001,Extremely Funny!!!,"Not even when I was kid had so much fun watching a cartoon. Shrek may lack other things but definitely not fun. Very smart dialogs, very unique characters with lot of witticism, and a excellent story telling makes Shrek the Children-Adult movie of the year from my point of view. Do not miss it!!!"
396,Shrek,10,16 July 2001,Brilliant comedy for whole family,"One of the best movies ever - and definitely the best in its genre.Impressive computer graphics, excellent design, funny story and multilevel jokes - what else do you need? And add a bunch of talented actors as a bonus. A must see, must have and must recommend.I've seen it twice and waiting to buy the DVD."
397,Shrek,9,16 July 2001,Amazing!,This movie is worth a nomination somewhere for the next Academy Awards. Truly amazing. Mike Myers and mostly Eddie Murphy (Donkey) were really funny!!! Two thumbs up!!! The scene of the wrestling was the best and I really love the way the movie ends too!!!
398,Shrek,8,17 July 2001,The perfect fairy tale for adults!!,"Shrek is the name of an ogre who lives in a swamp.  He is a grump and hates everyone and would rather be by himself than make any friends.  One day though, he discovers that fairy tale characters are flocking to him for protection after he reluctantly saves a talking donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy.  In a desperate atempt for Shrek to get everyone away from him, he goes to a midget wannabe King and demands that they remove the vagrants off his swamp land.The King agrees so long as he rescues a princess and returns her to him so he can marry her.  What insues is an Ogre that rescues a damsel that falls for him even though he is an unwilling participant at first, but of course we find out the Ogre has a heart and wants to be with the princess instead of giving her to the King.In short this movie is hysterical, unique, qwerky, and massively entertaining.  Eddie Murphy steals the show as a wisecracking donkey, and the animation is really top notch.  Many parodies abound, and the humour is directed more towards adults than it is for children (not that they wouldn't like it) making it more enjoyable.The perfect fairy tale for adults!!Rating 8 1/2 out of 10"
399,Shrek,,15 July 2001,"What a lot of miserable, po-faced funless people there are on IMDB...","I really dont understand all the complaints people had with this film.Yes, the plot is relatively simple. So what? It didnt matter, Its meant to be a fairy tale.Yes, there is some romance in it. So what? It worked well and was much more enjoyable than most romance films. And, after all, it is meant to be a fairy tale.Yes, some of the jokes are a little crude, but nowhere near as many as a lot of reviewers here seem to think. The majority of the jokes are extremely clever and witty. Fairy tales never were as twee and harmless as Disney made them into, earlier versions are full of vulgarity, and even sex.
I dont understand why one reviewer complained that the scottish accent Myers uses is completely out of character for Shrek. How do you know? When was the last time you heard an ogre?Dear oh dear. This film is just meant to be a funny fairy tale. Why cant people enjoy it for what it is? No, its not as deep as, say, Heavenly Creatures. But do you know why?Because it isnt meant to be. Dont get me wrong, Im a big fan of sublter, arthouse films too. But this is not a stupid film. As I said before, most of the humour is extremely clever. There really is something for everyone though, even a couple of genuinely exciting action sequences.If you can find the idea of the Seven Dwarves working in a chain gang funny, or laugh at the songs in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, then you should enjoy this film.If not, go back to trying to understand Lost Highway.I have one question for people. I could have sworn that John Cale's version of Hallelujah was used in the film, rather than the slightly different Rufus Wainwright version that appears on the cd. Am I right?And yes, unlike the rest of the reviewers, I liked the soundtrack."
400,Shrek,10,15 July 2001,The Best movies of the Summer.,"A great surprise of epic proportion. A funny, and Touching Family film that hits all the right buttons. I took My kids to see this when it came out, and I was cheering right a long with them This film is with out a doubt the Best film of the summer( The Mummy Returns Is a very close second) and i will see it again before it leaves the theater."
401,Shrek,,20 May 2001,Hilarious comedy for adults (at least),"OK, I admit, I didn't watch this movie looking to see it as a kid, or if it was made for kids.  Hell, I'm practically a kid myself (although from some of the movies I've seen, you never could tell).  This movie made me laugh out loud, and I loved almost every minute of it.  It was a great slaying of the traditional fairy tale, and of Disney and everything else.  And, yes, it is a dark movie in parts.  Comments have included the facts that Riverdance parodies are tired, and why the song ""All-Star?""  Well, first, Riverdance parodies may be just hitting the kid level (last year, it may have seemed tired in Scary Movie [to me], but kids shouldn't have seen that one).  Kids get things that are more popular nowadays, and they hold onto it for annoyingly longer periods of time.  Look at the phenomenon of the Nickelodeon's embrace of Baja Men's ""Who Let the Dogs Out.""  That was still being played long after I had grown tired of hearing it at frat parties.However, the best parts are in the beginning, especially.  The dark twists on every fairy tale that you know (and maybe even some I didn't), were just great.  The rest of the movie was pretty good too, but Donkey got annoying at times.  That may have been the point.  I dunno, but I highly recommend this one for adults, especially if you like your comedy slightly tainted. If you don't mind poking fun at dear things a little, and having fun.  Check this one out.8/10"
402,Shrek,10,13 July 2001,"Great animation, great and edgy humor, nice 'fairy-tale'","Just another childish animation? I don't think so. For starters, it seems a fairy-tale, but almost all are ridiculed. Next it has a humor so subtle you'll have to view multiple times to get all of it (who is farquad modeled after?). Furthermore the animations are stunning, especially compared to films like Toy Story.The main story is quite a standard fairy-tale. A ogre besets on a quest to rescue a fair princess guarded by a dragon. But the story is just a mask for all the twists and turns the makers were able to overload the movie with. The characters really come to life because of the perfect casting. Not the least Murphy as Donkey.A classic-to-be."
403,Shrek,,12 July 2001,Hilarious,"This movie was incredibly funny.  Not a Disney movie, but the writers definitely pulled off that Disney (or Simpsons) trick of making it funny to kids and adults on different levels.  Laughed harder than I have in a long time.  See it."
404,Shrek,,12 July 2001,Nice film - shame about the accent,"Shrek is great fun with terrific animation and some memorable one liners (especially from Eddie Murphy,) BUT who let Myers try a Scottish accent??? He consistently lapsed into a heavy US version of Scottish: the director would have been better off using Robbie Coltrane (whom Myers was presumably trying to impersonate anyway!)"
405,Shrek,10,11 July 2001,My new favourite comedy!!,"What more can I say, if you like the Toy Story movies, you'll love Shrek! If you go into the theatre not enjoying it, wait till the end because I think the best part of the movie is the very end.  Eddie Murphy did an excellent job!"
406,Shrek,10,11 July 2001,Well worth it.,"This is a brilliant film, simply put.  Leave all your film-buff nitpickings at the doorway.  Pure enjoyment; digital mastery. Appeal for everyone.  A great and very funny movie.I'm very critical of movies, so don't take this brevity to be the sign of some brain-washed fool who approves everything.  The movie is *good*.  The spoofing is clever, the humor is good - admittedly it's slightly cheesy in places but it works.  It works really well.  Go see it now.  Fun for all ages.  Good, good, and more good.  Go see it now!"
407,Shrek,,11 July 2001,Computer animation and toilet humour unite!,"I'm not a prude, far from it, but even I found certain elements of the film disgusting and unwarrented. Especially for a childrens film.Exibit A: Donkey urinates on a fire to put it out. Exibit B: Shrek farts in a pond, killing natural wildlife. Exibit C: Shrek farts, burps, etc. throughout the rest of the film.Normally I wouldn't mind, but there's no other humour in this flick. Apart from the ""Gingerbread Man"" scene. Other attempts are poor at best, for example: the ""Robin Hood"" scene, and crime on crime, he's doing the riverdance and is french (?!?!).Shrek wins the accolade of, ""Having the most predictable ending since The Sixth Sense"". Formulaic is this films middle name.On to the acting, it's not awful to say the least, apart from Mike Myers awful Scottish accent (even worse than in Austin Powers 2). John Lithgow is superb as usual, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy surpassed themselves.So then: to summerize, take your children to this film if you don't mind them laughing constantly as the main characters: fart, burp and urinate."
408,Shrek,10,20 May 2001,What a treat!,"I don't know what movie these last half-dozen or so people saw, but it sure wasn't the same delightful ""Shrek"" we saw today! Only an ironbound Disney loyalist could consider its humor mean-spirited in the least. (And besides, really, it's high time the high and mighty Disney empire took a few shots of this nature.) The alleged flatulence obsession amounts to *one* fart joke and *one* belch joke - come on now, guys. Even the moments of gross bug and food humor (and I think kids will love those) are limited to the opening scene in Shrek's house. But why dwell on this stuff when the movie is so charming? It takes two of the most classic fairy tale stories - the heroic quest/rescue and the ""beauty and beast"" romance (which, need I remind anyone, was NOT invented by the Mouse House?) - and updates them with a terrific combination of mildly edgy modern humor and the most dazzling computer animation yet. I could go on for paragraphs about the deliciousness of the fabric textures, the grasses and leaves stirring in the wind, the shine of hair...wow! Better yet, this technical quantum leap forward is never allowed to become the reason for the movie (as it so tiresomely is with live-action effects) but is kept firmly in the service of the story, providing emotional responses and facial expressions of such subtlety that even green ogres become humanly believable.  This is used especially well in the delicate development of the unspoken romance between Princess Fiona (who has already shown herself to be something other that what she appears!) and her rescuer, Shrek. Fiona - who begins by believing that only a guy with the correct princely trappings can be her true love and comes to see things quite differently - is a completely convincing creation, but so is proud, lonely Shrek and even his yakky sidekick Donkey. It is mind-boggling to contemplate what this technology will be used to do in the future. Here it has given us an adventure and a romance (yes it is!) crammed with visual humor, (And can I just take one moment to revel in all these Disney jokes? She-dragons with long eyelashes and lipstick! The Three Pigs with their eviction notice! Snow White in her glass coffin--and later brawling with Cinderella over the wedding bouquet! The individually named parking lots at Farquaad's castle! L-O-bloody-L!) --I have seen a lot of 6 and 8 movies in the past few months; this is my first 10 since ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and if it's my only 10 all summer I won't feel shortchanged. Don't listen to these complainers. See it."
409,Shrek,9,11 July 2001,Incredibly funny for all ages,"This is the first funny fairy tail cartoon style film that I have seen in a long time.  It demonstrates that a film can be both entertaining to small children and adults alike, by using innuendos that will only be noticed by the adults allowing it to keep it's U rating.  The characters are brilliantly thought out, Beautifully rendered, and the voices match them perfectly.  A good fairy tale plot with it's own cunning twist towards the end (OK so maybe it isn't very cunning, but it kept you interested) provides the perfect backdrop to keep you amused for the entire film."
410,Shrek,10,11 July 2001,Wow!,"When I thought about seeing Shrek, I thought about a little funny movie for little children. But this was completly wrong! Some expressions or scenes are something for older people, but not for six or seven year old children. However, this was the funniest movie since Scary Movie, its even better than Scary Movie or American Pie. Go and see the film, wit his great jokes about old Disney films!"
411,Shrek,,15 July 2001,Mixed thoughts,"When I cames out of the cinema, I has mixed thoughts about Shrek.  On one hand I liked it for it's visually stunning graphics and effects, but on the other hand I found that Shrek was slightly short with gaps missing and I couldn't cope with all that romance!Although you have to bear in mind that Shrek is more of a kids movie, this movie is quite funny in parts.  Donkey with the voice of Eddie Murphy is probably the most bizarre charactors I've seen in a childrens movie.  Mike Myers was brilliant as the voice of Shrek with his Scottish accent. Plus Cameron Diaz (who personally I don't rate very much) even did a good job as the voice of Princess Fiona.  But then I suppose if a movie like Shrek has some good action scenes in it, it also has to have sloppy romantic scenes too, that was the only let down of the movie.  I also thought the ""quest"" to save Princess Fiona was a bit short, apart from the scene where they were trying to escape the female dragon.  Not bad, but slightly over-hyped.7/10"
412,Shrek,9,8 July 2001,WOOOOOOOW,"Wow, what can I say.....maybe ""Shrek"" is THE Movie in the years 2001. It's pretty long ago when I laughed that much in a theatre like I did on friday during ""Shrek"". Great dialogues, great animation, great voices, great black humor. I just can say: Watch this Movie, it's a MUST. I really can't wait for the Return of the lovely green Ogre names ""Shrek"". I voted 9 of 10 !"
413,Shrek,,8 July 2001,"Good Animation, Bad Movie","THE ANIMATION:The animation in this movie was wonderful.  The textures and lighting brought the overall experience closer to reality than in previous 3D animated films. You may want to see it for this alone.THE MOVIE:As an animated children's/adult film it could be viewed from many perspectives. From mine, someone who prefers an art house film to a main-stream film, it seemed terribly predictable. Two reasons come to mind: shallow character development and a plot that served only to string a bunch of cheap jokes together. I also felt there was a gratuitous use of inappropriate music for a fairytale setting.It could be argued that all this was done in the name of fun. If this is the sole reason you watch movies, my critique will probably be irrelevant. However, if you like to watch movies to have your thoughts or emotions stirred you can pass on this one."
414,Shrek,10,8 July 2001,Well Done Dreamworks!,"Its the most entertaining computer animated feature cartoon, that I've ever seen in my life. The movie was full laughter and moral values.Keep up the good job Dreamworks!"
415,Shrek,7,7 July 2001,"Good summer fun, but not a classic!","I took my two daughters (ages 6 and 8 months) to see this film and we all enjoyed it from start to finish.  The animation is outstanding, acting is great, and the comedy is funny for both adults and children.
However, to have this movie ranked in the top 100 movies of all time is ridiculous.  Three years from now, this movie will be forgotten.  There is nothing that really sets it apart from any other animated movie.
It's a good movie but the bang-to-hype ratio is definitely skewed the wrong way here."
416,Shrek,10,6 July 2001,Awesome!,"This is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I was in stitches throughout. I also brought my 7- and 8-year-old daughters. The younger one really didn't want to see it, but by the end, they both wanted to run out to buy the DVD (which I'm also anxiously awaiting).Forget the stuffy naysayers and go see it. You won't regret it."
417,Shrek,,5 July 2001,What's all the fuss about?,"Making fun of Disney cartoons!!  Sacrilege! Maybe this was the case 20 or 30 years ago, when Mad Magazine did it.  Today, it's called brilliant when it's in the form of a fairy tale satire with burp and fart jokes produced by that company with a grudge, Dreamworks.  Yes, the voice talent is excellent, the animation amazing, (even if the humans still look a little creepy), and the soundtrack ain't too shabby either.  I didn't think any of the jokes were all that clever, save the Gingerbread Man Chinese milk torture.  It is watchable, but not the godsend the critics make it out to be."
418,Shrek,10,6 July 2001,Maybe the most charming fairy tale ever,"I simply pity those who find fault with this gem - their childhood must have been exceptionally dull and dreary. I've heard and read in  some uninspired reviews that many (or even most) of this film's humor would be on the farting-and-belching level. Uhm. Interesting. I guess the same is true about Shakespeare's work, which is all about killing. There isn't even ONE single instance of gratuitous vulgarity in the whole movie. Not one.
""Shrek"" is hilariously funny - but at the same time it is the most wise and compassionate animation movie in a long, long time, comparable to Disney classics, yet even surpassing them because of, well, irony. Shrek is full of it, and the totalitarian Disney-McCarthy regime of Lord Farqart is its main target.The animation is almost perfect in itself, far far better than anything up to date - and truly perfect for the setting and tone of the story. The music is inspired and extremely original in this context: we get Smash Mouth, the Proclaimers, John Cale singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and in the end an All Stars Fairy Tale rendition of Neil Diamond's ""Now I'm a believer"".
The story, the characters, most of the dialogue, all of the voices, the matte painting, the animation, the music, the movie as a whole: Inspired and among the very greatest of its kind."
419,Shrek,7,4 July 2001,"A Really Funny Comedy, Sour Ending","Shrek is a hilarious spin off of a fairy tale in which Shrek (ogre, played my Mike Myers), is mad because for some strange reason all the fairy tale creatures are sent to his swamp where they create a nuisance for Shrek. Shrek and a new acquaintance, Donkey (played by Eddie Murphy), go to Lord Farkquad (played by John Lithgow; the midget sized prince who is trying to be evil but is still funny), because Farkquad was the one who banished the fairy tale creatures to his land. He requests if Shrek wants to get his land back, he must get Princess Fiona, (played by Cameron Diaz), who is locked in a tower guarded by a dragon. Shrek succeeds, and on the return trip, they fall in love. Their is a surprise ending, (don't worry, I won't tell you), an ending that I don't really like, and that is the reason that I gave it the rating I did. I do suggest you see this movie however, due the overwhelmingly funny jokes and characters."
420,Shrek,6,5 July 2001,Why has this movie made a gazillion dollars?,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This film follows an unlikely hero, the title character Shrek (voiced by Myers of Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery), an ugly green ogre with an unexplained Scottish accent. He's feared by all men, even the most brave and courageous. The story begins when the ruthless Lord Farquaad (voiced by Lithgow from television's ""3rd Rock From the Sun""), a man surprisingly short for his place of power, decides that his kingdom must be perfect. He wishes to be the most entertaining person in the land. Several theme parks and exciting tournaments have helped him earn popularity, but Farquaad is still beaten by the legendary fairy tale creatures, who are still regarded as being more fun. In order to achieve perfection, the short Lord kidnaps and banishes all the mythological beings to a disgusting swampland. This mucky terrtain happens to be Shrek's humble home. As long as the fairy tale creatures are in his swamp, Shrek cannot live in peace. Farquaad also finds himself with a problem. Before he can truly rule this wonderful kingdom, the Lord must marry a princess. The two arrange an agreement. In order to get his homeland back from Farquaad, Shrek must team up with an overly verbose donkey (voiced by Murphy of The Nutty Professor) and rescue the imprisoned Princess Fiona (with the voice of Diaz, Charlie's Angels) from the fire-breathing dragon that protects her holding cell. When Fiona is safely returned and wed to Farquaad, Shrek will get the deed to the swamp. This becomes more difficult when Shrek and Fiona find themselves falling in love.Generally speaking, the story is a little lame. It's the same old fantasy conventions sloppily mixed together to give the film a basic framework. However, to make Shrek stand apart from these boring children's tales, Dreamworks has added a twist. They utilize these famous conventions simply to poke fun at the generic fairy tale narrative. For example, we've all seen that touching moment where beauty and nature intertwine, and the princess sings a delightful high-pitched tune with a quaint little songbird. Shrek does not forget to include this scene, but it turns fatal when the vocal duel causes the cute bluebird to spontaneously explode into a burst of feathery remains. This odd sense of humor, where the standard fantasy moments are brutally insulted, makes for a large number of fairly humorous occasions.Thankfully, Dreamworks does not hold anything back, especially when it comes to their animation adversary, Disney, who have survived for years by retelling fairy tales and legends. Shrek includes appearances from several of the most popular Disney icons, like Pinocchio and Snow White. Alongside these comical references are quick stabs at other Disney ventures, like the shops and theme parks. In fact, the inner court of Lord Farquaad's castle is designed to resemble Disneyland's Main Street, complete with annoying theme songs and a cartoonish mascot. In addition to these more obvious allusions, there is a great number of subtle industry insider's humor, fashioned particularly for true film enthusiasts like myself. For example, the tiny stature of Lord Farquaad, the only character to not appear in the original children's book, is a reference to several years back, when the head of Disney and the head of Dreamworks made some similar comments to each other regarding height. Those who are aware of the incident will get the joke. Others will not even realize they missed something. Many other jokes fall under this category, showing that Shrek is really trying to appeal to many different audiences.Unfortunately, the film has difficulty catering to all audiences at the same time. Shrek wants to be a kids movie, so most of the film is wasted with juvenile toilet humor, leaving the older audiences shafted. It relies on raunchy and disgusting situations to supply most of the laughs. There is an overabundance of burping and flatulence. There are even a couple crotch shots. The jokes are too dirty for younger children, but far too immature for a normal adult audience. I found myself stone-faced throughout many of the unsuccessful attempts, disappointed that the smart comedy was tainted by this form of lowbrow humor.To make things even worse, the character of Shrek is not even enjoyable. If you couldn't tell from the short plot summary, this green ogre doesn't have an ounce of charm, something this movie desperately needed. His intentions are never noble and he's an utterly disgusting creature. He throws insults left and right, he has no respect for others, and his hygiene is grotesque. Granted, Shrek is a nasty and secluded monster. His total lack of compassion is a result of others judging him by his appearance. But without some sincerity to his character, I found myself unable to identify with his pain or care about his feelings. Since Shrek is not the kind of hero you want to cheer on, there is no way to become attached to the story and immersed in the action. I actually found myself more interested in many of the fairy tale creatures, such as the vulgar and sarcastic Gingerbread Man and the mysteriously clever Three Blind Mice. Any one of these supporting characters would have been a more enjoyable main character than Shrek.
The final result is nothing overly impressive. Dreamworks set out to insult the folks at Disney, and Shrek certainly accomplishes that task. The animation is decent, but not nearly as amazing as the work in Antz, or any one of the Pixar flicks. The soundtrack is awful, including chart-topping hits like Smash Mouth's ""All-Star,"" and other songs that don't really seem to fit the film's tone. The dialogue is used only to advance the characters to the next joke, not as a means of saying anything of importance. The list of this movie's shortcomings could go on for quite a while, which in itself is quite a disappointment. Shrek provides just enough smart material to make the experience enjoyable, but not particularly valuable."
421,Shrek,10,20 May 2001,Cleverness + Originality + Hilarity x 2 = SHREK!,"I just got back from seeing the movie Shrek and let me tell you, it lives up to it's hype (which is good, 'cause I hate getting pumped for movies and being let down).The story begins in the swamp of Shrek the Ogre (Mike Meyers), who doesn't want anything to do with anybody-he's extremely solitude. Why? Because he can't stand how whenever people see him, they only see a big, ugly monster and they don't see what he is inside. But soon he meets someone who insists on being buddies with him-Donkey (Eddie Murphy), the talking donkey, who refuses to leave Shrek be. Shrek just wants to get on with his life like normal...without Donkey...but that doesn't exactly work out when suddenly his swamp is littered with all sorts of Fairy Tale creatures, who were banished to there because of an eviction notice from Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). So Shrek makes a deal with Lord Farquaad that if he'll give him back his land, Shrek will go and get the sleeping Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from her tower trap to be Lord Farquaad's bride. Shrek and Donkey go on their journey, retrieve Princess Fiona, and therefore begin a trip back to the kingdom that they'll never forget.This is one of the most original animated movies I've seen in quite some time. They story was very clever and never confused you. It also had a couple of good plot twists that didn't screw up the movie's flow or seem out of place. Good work.Mike Meyers did a wonderful job voicing Shrek. His accent was believably Scottish and he was able to maintain the accent smoothly. Eddie Murphy is always great when he does voice-overs. Cameron Diaz also did a good job of making smooth transitions between Princess Fiona's many emotions. And John Lithgow had the evil yet funny Lord thing down perfect.The animation was wonderful. All of the scenery was well done and the characters were drawn well. This is the best computer animated flick since the Toy Story series.10/10"
422,Shrek,10,4 July 2001,Side-splitting laughter all the way,"An hilarious spoof on many a fairytale and fable that we remember from our youth and from life today!  From the opening scene reference to the alleged history of how mail order catalogs serve a dual purposes in life, to one of the closing scene lines about celebrity `fairytale' marriages, this film is packed full of fun and surprises.It is worth the money to see it over again and perhaps a third time just to enjoy all of the hidden references to fictional fairytale circumstances and real-life fabled events.  The young kids will catch the newer sarcastic tones and the baby-boom generation will laugh harder than they have in years!One caution to parents of kids under 6 years  this film does contain some graphically displayed humor that may be offensive, but the language is suitable for all ages.  Take the kids and see who laughs the loudest  you might just be surprised!"
423,Shrek,,3 July 2001,Funnier than Expected,"Before seeing this, I - like many others - thought that this would be just another ""cartoon"" to take the kids.  What I found out was that this was a ""cartoon"" written more for adults.  With many movie referrals, Disney-bashing, and some ""inside"" jokes - this movie had me laughing from beginning to end.  While some younger kids may find the characters themselves to be amusing - adults will probably get more of the jokes. Overall, I highly recommend this film."
424,Shrek,8,20 May 2001,funny. really funny.,"If you're looking for a thought provoking revolution in film-making, go see Memento. Shrek is a fun summer animated comedy aimed at real kids. Are you looking for a rated G fairy tale? Go rent the Fox and the Hound. I repeat - Shrek is a fun summer animated comedy aimed at real kids. Shrek is without a doubt the funniest animated movie to come around since Toy Story. If you didn't like Toy Story, you probably won't like Shrek. If you can't stand the preachy tone of Disney (as I can't) but you still want a funny movie for the entire family - GO SEE SHREK! The smash mouth tune to open the film was dumb and I was worried that the entire movie would be ever so hip. Not so. It's a good funny movie the rest of the way.By the way, one review that commented on the dated Macerana tune - you obviously haven't been to a wedding reception lately. Trust me - the Macerana is alive and doing well and the film-makers knew exactly where to place it."
425,Shrek,6,8 July 2001,Good - but not as good as I'd hoped,"I enjoyed this movie - but not as much as I'd hoped. Don't get me wrong, for an adult it's better than any Disney film but it's just not that funny. That are no great jokes in it and you sort of sit waiting for the really good bits to come - but they don't because there aren't any. It's entertaining enough and it treats the audience with respect (no silly sentimentality) but it's no Antz. I think that the major problem is the plot - it's very weak so all the other good bits in the movie (the attitude, voices, animation etc.) simply make up for the lack of plot. So 6/10."
426,Shrek,9,7 July 2001,90 minutes of pure fairytale magic,"I saw this movie half an hour ago and I'm still vibrating - the music, the characters, the animation, the story....wow! I'm definitely getting the score! And, as a first for me, the soundtrack with the songs on it! I don't usually buy any of that 'soundtrack' stuff and usually go for OSTs, but this movie integrated the songs so well that it should no way be missed! There are also some really cool camera angles, which I tend to watch for nowadays after seeing The Third ManRecent trend emerging - vastly superior computer-animated features. How do these people seem to round up the funniest writers in the business for this type of movie? Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Bug's Life, Antz (not forgetting the non-CGI Chicken Run)...these are all hilariously written and they're all CGI films! Even the upcoming Monsters Inc. (dying to see it) appears to be even more funny and imaginative! Mind you, they're all Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks produced My instinct is that it's a big competition between Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks to come up with the funniest ideas and revolutionary technology for these films - thats a good thing about competition like this, it propels people to new lengths. Ever since The Lion King new life has been breathed into the genre of animated features. With the exception of things like Pokemon in all fairness.The film itself is just so uplifting that the feeling and memories are bound to stay with you for days! Wise-crack, in jokes, identifiable characters...all great stuff. The dialogue between characters is so witty, funny and smart that you can identify with the characters extremely well and the relationships between them are sticking out like Boy George! It plays with great fun on the fairytale genre, with references to many different fairytales (and various other things, like The Matrix and Riverdance), using them to great effect, creating a magical atmosphere that is unsurpassed and greatly aided by the computer animation.The music, as I said before, is absolutely amazing. Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell do massive credit to themselves in the score for this movie, as they did before for the fab Chicken Run. You can definitely tell at times where Gregson-Williams' influence was most apparent, seeing as he is a student of Hans Zimmer! The songs, some of which most people should recognise, are integrated so well into the emotions of certain parts of the movie that they amplify these emotions, giving the viewer a real feel of the magic. Combined with the superb score (I can't say that enough) this truly is a feast for the senses, not least of hearing - it's a joy to both watch and hear.The one thing I would say on the negative side is that the ending is a bit predictable and there is a brief slump into sentimentality, but then again most fairytales go this way!Rating? 9 out of ten, without doubt!"
427,Shrek,5,7 July 2001,NOT QUITE TOY STORY,"Take this film as summer multiplex fare, and it towers over some of it's competitors. It's funny, amusing, stunning and short. However it's not as clever as it thinks it is. Yes ""The Matrix"" and Disney gags are funny. However I bet they'll be a Dreamworks theme park in 10 years time. Also, doesn't every Disney theme have a witty sidekick with all the best lines. Ultimately ""Toy Story"" and ""Antz"" set the standards, and this isn't quite up to it.Can someone also explain why Myers is doing a bad Ewan McGregor impression? Do ogres not speak with U.S accents?"
428,Shrek,,7 July 2001,"Only Has An Hour Or So To be Hilarious, and Fails","Shrek was, well, not healthy for children and other living things.  From seeing this mind-numbing ""fairy tale"", it's no wonder to me why our children are now dumber than a bag of hammers.  These so-called children's movies condescend the audience into a state of utter slothfulness, and our kids are left without a thought in their tiny little brains.  For once I'll be glad to re-read the Grimm Brothers; at least they entertained children with horrifying stories of violence, debauchery, and sadism.  The most terrifying part of Shrek is paying eight bucks to see it, and thinking to yourself ""I hate this film, everything about it is bad"".  Well, it all wasn't terrible, the computer graphics were great and, well, nevermind, it still bites the big one.  Full of meaningless pop culture references and mindless child manipulation tactics, expect your child to want to blow your money on worthless merchandise and clothing and God knows what else.  The jokes about bad breath and Freud?-hey, this is the Dark Ages; Continuity!  I was impressed by how primitive their eviction notices were in the Dark Ages. (If you see the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.) Rating: 4/10 (I Don't Know, It's starting to Look like last summer, all over again)"
429,Shrek,10,5 July 2001,The first blockbuster 2001 that is really brilliant,"After all those major disappointments this year like Pearl Harbor, Tomb Raider or Mummy 2, this film really rocks! The animation is amazing, the music rules and the story is well written and hilariously funny. If you know Disney films and fairy tales, it's all in there! You can watch the film again and again, you'll always discover new little details...This film is the first film this summer that is really worth the money! Go and see it if you haven`t!"
430,Shrek,10,2 July 2001,Fairy Tales for the New Millennium,"I haven't laughed that hard in quite a while. It has almost everything that you desire: True love, evil villains, great heroes, magic, even a dragon (incredibly cute...), music and beauty (Of course, you could also read 'The Princess Bride' for all that...). It has memorable quotes from a few of the best movies... in the least expected place. You might enjoy it."
431,Shrek,8,5 July 2001,"Funny, nuff said?","Shrek is, without a doubt, a very funny and entertaining movie.  The humor ranges from a small dose of gross out humor (in the form of a rather funny fart joke) to flat out parody (The Matrix, and Disney to name a few.)  Most of it works, some of it doesn't.  But you find yourself laughing anyway. There is just no reason not to like this movie unless you don't like cartoons, or you work for Disney."
432,Shrek,7,2 July 2001,"Unusually ""Adult"" Animation with Jabs at Disney","Good for the acting and the inside jokes, but Shrek is unusually adult in orientation for an animated comedy.  It seems like a certain former Disney Exec. is venting lots of steam at his former employer and their trademark properties.  Perhaps the jokes were a bit mean and inside, but well worth the fun if you have seen enough Disney movies."
433,Shrek,9,2 July 2001,A new classic,"(no spoilers)This was a movie I completely enjoyed.  I heard quite a bit about the movie, but was leery about seeing a movie that was intended for kids, ""but adults will enjoy it also""... My resistance in this case was futile... it was the best $8 I've spent so far this year - NO WONDER it has done so well.Shrek is going to be around a long time.  Move over Mickey, Donald, Bugs, Pooh, Buzz... you have company!  Many years from now, I'm sure I'll be dusting off the DVD of this movie, and show it to my grandkids, and laugh right along with them, all over again.Excellent visuals, well-developed characters, a great story, and incredibly smooth, flowing dialog...  a classic is born.If you haven't, go see it... its not to be missed!jv"
434,Shrek,9,2 July 2001,Amazing...,"Arguably one of the best animated movies ever, hand-drawn or computer generated. It's funny, character-driven, and best of all, it pokes fun at familiar institutions without coming off as mean or spiteful. This movie is so good, I saw it in the theatres twice in one week. If you haven't seen it, then you definitely haven't invested your cinema money wisely.I can honestly recommend this movie to everyone I know, because it has something for everyone. It has the kind of sophomoric humour that you would associate with Austin Powers and Eddie Murphy, but very often they unleash a very clever and smart joke, which almost gets by you. Then, as soon as you realise what they said, it's almost time for the next big joke.There is nothing new in this movie. Almost every aspect of this movie is a cliche of one sort or another. The damsel in distress, the ugly duckling, true love conquering all. You can see the ending from a mile away, but you're still happy when it happens. It's all in the presentation. Even if you're doing something everyone has seen before, what matters is how you do it. And trust me, they do it well.My personal favourite part is how they take all of the fairy tale cliches, and throw them right back at the audience, in a way that can best be described as irreverent and sharp, yet gentle and appealing. In other words, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!"
435,Shrek,9,1 July 2001,Remarkably good.,"*** Warning: Possible spoilers ***OK, I have to admit that the only reason I went to see this movie is because of the voice talent on show in the movie. The basic premise of this movie is no different to most other animated flicks, i.e. your typical Disney-fied story of the beautiful girl falling for the average schmoe after an adventure-filled journey through the woods. Ho-hum, I thought, but being a big Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy fan, I decided to check it out anyway, hoping that they would liven things up a bit.And that's exactly what happens. The story, from start to finish, is predictably predictable, yet Myers and Murphy are in fine form delivering witty one-liners throughout the film. Cameron Diaz is also excellent as Princess Fiona, and although John Lithgow basically reprises his '3rd Rock From The Sun' role as the omnipotent, egotistical high commander in this film, it's a perfect fit.The audiovisual department has also done a fine job in the movie. The hype surrounding the graphics is justified, and although some of the songs featured on the soundtrack don't seem to have been properly used in the movie, they're enjoyable nonetheless.The ending is incredibly sappy, even compared to the usual animated happy endings, but then that could have been expected. Despite the obvious attempts to make the film appealing to adults, it's still predominantly a children's flick. Ultimately though, the outstanding voice performances by the four leads makes a conventional storyline pleasantly refreshing for people of all ages.8/10"
436,Shrek,,1 July 2001,Great,"Shrek is a great movie that I would definetley recommend seeing. The plot line is great, Shrek and his side kick donkey, Donkey, set out on an adventure after being ordered by the to be king of the land they live on. They are to rescue a princess from a tower guarded by a dragon and bring her back to the king, where she will marry him. This movie is definatley funny, and if you havn't seen it, I'd go see it. Although I didn't think it was as good as I was expecting, I still thought it was good. Rating: 7/10"
437,Shrek,10,3 July 2001,"Spectacular, Funny and a real message...","Some few hours ago I had the pleasure to watch a preview of the Dreamworks super-blockbuster SHREK here in Germany! Well, what am I to say now? This movie rocks! It's one of the best movies I've seen until now this year. There's lot of fun, romance, action and comedy in it! The animation is almost photorealistic, but still preserves the animation style! A wonderful movie for all ages! What else to say than maybe: I've got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it! I'll buy the DVD and I'm very sure about that! See you and... Get to know the people and don't judge 'em because of their outer appearance! Yours, Tobi"
438,Shrek,9,30 June 2001,He likes to get...PAID,"I have to admit I prefered to go to Bridget Jones's diary, but my stubbourn friend Lonneke practically dragged me into this movie. But,. when I come to think of it, I realise I DO like animation movies. I liked The Nightmare before Christmas, I liked, Chicken Run, but I liked this one the best of 'em all. For me, as I live in The Netherlands, it's important to get the right version (not with the Dutch dialogs; those versions are horrible, most of the jokes get lost), allthough you lose a lot of jokes through the subtitles. But the humour is very sublime: Everyone who is mature enough, gets it. The youngest (hopefully) miss it. The story is very creative and not as soggy as, for instance, Cinderella. I didn't like the moral, but hey, that's the main objective of a fairytale: to be moralising, so we'll skip that aspect. The voice-casting is great and aspecially Eddy Murphy and Mike Myers's voices are much like you'd Imagine the characters to have. The hint to the Matrix is very well-done (but they could have made Robin Hood look like Keanu Reeves. O, and another thing I didn't get: Why did Robin Hood have a French accent? Probably to show us he's a real casanova, but despite the French-English disputes around that time, Robin Hood spoke English since he's from Sherwood Forest, but I think we all know THAT story) but since I am a rat-lover myself, I hated them for eating the rats. This probably sounds stupid, but I am weird. But the best thing of all was the disneyland-hint. Beautyfull! If there's one thing more moralising than the average fairytale, it's Disney. Yak.In short (I can hear you think: thank god): rating of 9/10."
439,Shrek,,29 June 2001,"Cynical, sarcastic, crude.... wonderful?","Of course, the above are merely scratching the surface of any accurate description of Shrek. The film is stunning visually, and the humor is like that of the Warner Brothers or Jay Ward - delightful spoofs.Now, don't take me wrong. I love certain Disney productions, most of which were made in the 40s (Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo, Fantasia). But the studio's talent for storytelling has faded and is encroached on more and more every year by the demand to provide stunning visuals over the true essence of good cinema: stories. Shrek, as unlikely a candidate as it struck me as before seeing it, has these things. The animation, although entirely computer generated (anyone else intimidated by the fact that the most enjoyable American animated films of the past few years have all been CGI?) is realistic and believable, but what really knocked my socks off was the appeal Shrek has that can be channeled both to adults and children, and yes, adolescents like myself. Some of the gags are more fun than others, such as the sharp wit of the dialogue being more enjoyable to me than the title character wiping his posterior with a page from a book, but this only demonstrates the film's ability to articulate its audience's interests.Our characters are rather simple, really: A pessimistic, lonesome (but in denial) ogre voiced by Mike Myers who lives out in a swamp, an obscenely talkative donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy, a diminutive, egotistical, one-dimensional lord of the kingdom of Duloc named Farquaad and an isolated-until-freed-by-Shrek-princess named Fiona with an overly melodramatic way of handling things, a minor attitude problem, and the ability to kill birds with her terribly high singing ala Snow White but simply not so.Farquaad's rounding up fairy-tale critters to make room and they subsequently run for haven in Shrek's swamp. We meet, along the way, the three bears, the three blind mice, the three pigs, the wolf in grandmother's clothes, the fairy Godmother, Peter Pan, Pinocchio, the Magic Mirror (who provides Farquaad with his choices for a future wife ala the Dating Game), the Gingerbread Man, The seven dwarves and countless others (look out for a hilarious musical number by someone named ""Monsieur Hood"" as he tries to woo Fiona with his merry men). The film's production unit obviously spent more time on the main four characters than others - some of the lesser characters and background people look without much in the line of experession or detail, but this is a forgivable sin in the animation industry given how much crap is released annually with character designs devoid of any style whatsover.The choice of music, mainly Smashmouth and the Monkees, in some way or another, isn't too fitting, but it's also forgivable. Abandoning such superficialities as character designs, choice of music and detail in animation, I repeat, we have a good story with good dialogue and uproarious humor here. One of the best films of the year unquestionably.
Now, why can't we figure out how to make traditionally animated films that are as much fun as SHREK or the TOY STORY films on a regular basis?"
440,Shrek,,29 June 2001,Best movie of 2001 so far...,"As a person with a movie gold card (i.e. unlimited free movies). there have been too many occasions when I had to leave the cinema prematurely watching so called ""kid movies"" (e.g. See Spot Run was just plain awful). ...fortunately this cannot be said of Shrek... From start to finish I was totally loving this movie...so much so that I have seen it 3 times so far....Really, the audience reaction on a late night friday was quite something... I cannot add to what people have been saying because its been done to death...but all I can say is if you're gonna watch only one film this year make it Shrek. ( I will hold judgement on Final Fantasy )."
441,Shrek,9,28 June 2001,"Extraordinary fun, even for me!","Going into Shrek, I didn't expect much. After all, this was supposed to be a lame comedic effort for kids. Worse, it was a CARTOON about Fairy-Tales. Definitely not the action delivered by a good summer movie such as some of the other films in theaters (ex. Fast and the Furious, Swordfish...). Little did I know know that Shrek would beat out these films in terms of pure entertainment.This is a great comedy, with a solid story, for everyone to watch. I know, usually, when they say ""everyone"", it means young kids and a few sentimental adults. Yet, as a 17 year old, I can truly say this movie is good, very good. Just ignore the stereotypes and go see the movie. You'll soon realize that Shrek is a masterpiece."
442,Shrek,,30 June 2001,Wonderful,"SPOILER ALERT!!!This film is well done and stands strongly in the field of the animation flops we've seen over the past few years.  No matter what the naysayers on this page say, the movie has strong character development, a strong, coherent plotline, and a good moral to the story - Fiona will take love's true form when she is kissed, and the form isn't human - it's a very ruebenesque/voluptuous, green- skinned, gap-toothed, round-faced ogress.  I think this is a good film for little girls who are entranced with Barbie, and little boys who think the girl with glasses in their class is ""ugly.""  This is a film that could have a strong conversation between parents and their children emerge afterwards. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is the last animated film that I would point towards as having a strong female character for little girls to emulate.  Now if we can see a mixture of Fiona's ogre looks and Belle's intelligence and common sense, we'd have a character that could be held up as somewhat more realistic than Barbie and Midge.Is it witty?  Yes.  Is it silly?  Yes.  Can it be offensive?  Yes (poor frog).  Is it truthful?  Depends on your point of view.  But there's a point to it all.  This is not a film you can sit idly by and watch - it takes some thinking on your part (unlike PEARL HARBOR).Parents, I strongly suggest not taking children under 9 or so.  You are the best judge in the matter, though - so I would say go to the movie first, then take your kids if they're ready."
443,Shrek,,26 June 2001,What a great film...Take that Disney!,"Dreamworks have come up with a truly great animated family film. I Went to see it with my 9 year old daughter and we were both enthralled from start to finish.  Truly works on two levels, with some of the Disney jibes for adults being spot on (the ""clean"" community of Duloc anyone?), but my daughter never getting bored as the story kicks along at a good pace.  The animation was as good as I've seen and, dare I say it, a rival for Toy Story 2/ Dinosaur in terms of visual excellence.  Only slight criticism might be that it was too short (although ""it is better to leave the table slightly hungry!""), and Mike Myers exceptionally dodgy Scottish accent.  If they wanted a Scottish ogre,  why not pick a Scottish actor?Still, this minor criticism aside, I feel this film is destined to become a classic.  I eagerly await the DVD release!!"
444,Shrek,9,29 June 2001,Very Entertaining movie,"Highly successful movie. Great mix of animation, characters, story, cast and music. No major weak points and the effort put into this really shows. Never seen such expressiveness in the emotions on animated faces. Hard to believe they aren't real. Some people have commented on low brow jokes in this movie but they really were not that bad at all. Just the odd fart joke. Who cares there are so many clever gags and side swipes of typical Disney type cartoon movies. Should be fun for almost anyone."
445,Shrek,10,26 June 2001,If you don't like this movie go check your pulse as you may well actually be dead and hadn't realised.,"Take a dash of Austin Powers, the merest hint of Dr. Evil, a splash of Fat Bastard and a cup of Stuart, Charlie's father from So I Married an Axe-Murderer and edit for expletives and you get Shrek. Add Eddie Murphy on better form than in Mulan, Cameron Diaz (enough said) and John Lithgow throw in the funniest script in decades and send ups of everything from Gremlins 2 to The Neverending story, every film Mike Myers has done and everything emanating from Walter Elias Disney's brainchild and you get just about the funniest film I've seen in ages.If you don't like this movie go check your pulse as you may well actually be dead and hadn't realised."
446,Shrek,10,26 June 2001,A Fairy Tale for Adults,"This movie was perhaps the funniest I've seen in ages.  Despite being animated, which might turn a lot of adult viewers away, this movie had me and everyone with me laughing so hard we had tears in our eyes.  I'm not particularly fond of Cameron Diaz, but even she didn't bother me in this movie.  Everyone did great.  The characters are oddball, the plot is twisted, and just when you think you know what's going on, the pull something else out of their hat.  The whole movie is over the top in such a great way, I can't wait to own it on DVD."
447,Shrek,10,25 June 2001,One of my new all-time favorites!!!,"Great story line (I am going to buy the book), superb animation, and the characterizations seem very real. Toward the end the story made me need to dry my eyes, then the laughter took over!  I am going to see it again at the theater at least two more times, and I want the video when it is released!I LOVED IT!!!"
448,Shrek,,25 June 2001,Nothing But Fun,"It does not surprise me that ""Shrek"" has had such across-the-board support from parents and kids.  More than most animated films I have seen, this one truly lives up to the durable cliche ""fun for the whole family"".  It's packed to the gills with gross-out sight gags and wild slapstick that will keep the little ones in stitches, while the adults will roar at the film's one-liners, cynical take on the fairy tale, and dead-on ridiculing of the Disney money machine.Shrek (voiced with a rich Scots burr by Mike Myers) is a foul-tempered ogre who lives in a mucky swamp.  He scares away anyone who sets foot in his boggy home, but all his bluster is just a shield for loneliness; he believes his ugliness has doomed him to a life of solitude.  That all ends, however, when a passel of fairy tale characters, banished from the kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), set up camp in his swamp.  Desperate to get his swamp back, Shrek journeys to Farquaad's surprisingly theme-park-esque kingdom to confront him.  Instead of his swamp, he is given a mission to slay a dragon and rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), who the diminutive lord wishes to take for his bride.  Shrek and his talking donkey, Donkey (Eddie Murphy), rescue the princess, but on the way back to Farquaadland, things get complicated when ol' Shrek starts feeling those butterflies for Fiona...     This endearing fractured-fairy-tale narrative sets us up for countless beautifully delivered gags that send up the conventions and characters of children's stories.  A Robin Hood character and his men prove to be a little more merry than they probably need to be.  A gingerbread man is subject to unspeakable tortures, right down to having his legs washed down with a glass of cold milk.  An epic battle between Shrek and Farquaad's knights is a slam-bang WWF-style extravaganza.  It's all so silly that you can't help but giggle in delight. The film saves its best gags for its send-up of the Walt Disney animation ethos, the studio's co-opting of sometimes prickly fairy tale characters and investing of them with a marketable, kid-friendly aura.  Here, the same characters we have loved in Disney pictures are edgy, quarrelsome types, and the hero is not your typical square-jawed Disney type, but a lumpy, bumpy, green-scaled lug.  With bad teeth.  Oh, and there's an out-of-nowhere swipe at ""It's a Small World"" that alone is worth the price of admission.Still, if all this film had going for it was sarcastic humor, I don't think it would have become the blockbuster it is.  There are, I think, three major secrets to ""Shrek""'s success.  First, the animation is amazing, taking computer-generated imagery to new heights of realism and tactility.  The backgrounds are flawless in their verisimilitude, and the characters look as rich and full-bodied as anyone in live-action films.  Second, the story is a genuinely sweet one.  Shrek may look like a beastie, but underneath, he just wants to be loved.  Kids can sometimes be mean to other kids just because they look or sound different, so the moral of a film like ""Shrek"" is a truly useful one for them to learn.  Not only does the film show that Shrek just wants love, but that he DESERVES it, in spite of his obvious, uh, grossness.Third, the vocal talent really gives their all to these characters, making them as well-rounded as the animation.  Myers is blustery and bluff as Shrek.  Cameron Diaz, who I often find a bit overbearing in live-action films, here is actually a very funny and endearing presence.  Lithgow by now can do plummy English villains in his sleep, but he still has fun with Farquaad, and Eddie Murphy gets some of the biggest laughs of the film as the talking donkey (""The trick is getting him to shut up""). I have a lot of friends who have an irrational and unfortunate prejudice against animated films, somehow believing them less legitimate films than live-action.  These are the same friends who queue up for teeniebopper junk like ""Josie and the Pussycats"", and I feel sorry for them.  I urge anyone who hasn't had a chance to check out ""Shrek"" to give it a look.  Believe me, it's not just for kids.  And for anyone who has seen it, I have just one word:Parfait."
449,Shrek,10,26 June 2001,One Of A Kind,"Just took my Wife to see ""Shrek"". My 3rd time Her first. As good the third time as the first if not better. No wonder it's over $200 Mil and rising. The animation is unlike anything else ever produced. Facial expressions, finger and arm movements the grass moves as they walk etc etc.The story line was simply great. My wife who normally does not care for movies was simply raving after the show. Don't miss it....."
450,Shrek,5,24 June 2001,Not as good as Pixar,"Ok, so Eddie Murphy was downright hilarious, but there was something about Mike Myers' not-quite-Scottish accent that just really bugged me - and normally, I love Mike Myers. I also thought that Cameron Diaz was kind of ho-hum./*** SPOILER ALERT ***/But enough about the talent, what really bothered me was that the fairy-tale creature situation was a such a weak part of the plot. I mean, why did Farquaad need to round up *all* the fairy-tale creatures to find he mirror? Why was he interrogating the Gingerbread Man? Sure the scene was pretty funny, but why would the Gingerbread Man have some special knowledge of the Magic Mirror as opposed to, oh, I don't know, the Seven Dwarves or the Wicked Queen? I know, I know, these are pretty petty things to complain about in a film where the strength of the plot clearly was never intended to be one of the strong points, but for me, this was just the tip of the iceberg.Speaking of petty things, some of the barbs against Disney seemed just a bit too spiteful to me, especially given Katzenburg's well known spite towards Disney.And of course, was anyone even remotely surprized when Fiona's true form turned out to be an Ogre and not a princess? Ok, ok, maybe it wasn't really supposed to be that much of a shock (at least not to anyone over age 8), but still, did they have to beat me over the head with their ""ugly doesn't mean ugly"" message? And speaking of which (again), can someone please explain to me why it's not ok to make fun of someone for being ugly, but it _is_ ok to make fun of people for being short?Ok, I'll admit it, there were some things I really liked about Shrek (i.e. any time the Donkey opened his mouth), but there were too many things that just didn't seem quite right. Next time I want to see an extremely well animated CGi film with an off-kilter story that brilliantly appeals to both young and old with a deft but subtle mix of humour, wit, and wisdom, without resorting to sarcasm and fart jokes, I'll wait for the next offering from Pixar."
451,Shrek,10,24 June 2001,Very cool!,"Shrek is a funny, clever enjoyable movie! I could not sincerly believe anyone who would say he did not like that movie! It's just like someone saying they don't like rainbows or bubbles, simply doesn't make sense!It's an animation movie, but except for the whole animation thing, the movie is clearly for adults. The dialogs are so full of hidden jokes kids don't get. This makes a movie that everyone, from age 0 to 99999 can enjoy.Simply take this quote from the movie when Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) :Lord Farquaad: Where are the other creatures? Gingerbread Man: Eat Me!"
452,Shrek,9,24 June 2001,Disney through a nicely twisted looking glass,"Forget Bambi, forget Disney, forget almost every other recent new wave animation film that you've seen (except, possibly, Toy Story).  Forget? Yes, because Shrek will give you a reminder of nearly all of them, and 'The Matrix' along the way, but with a cunning and subtle twist. This is real off-the-wall stuff.Here we have a masterful telling of a fairy story with a difference, full of charm, hilarity, sendups, a dragon (you can not have a fairy story without a dragon), a Princess, a hero, talking animals, and, did I mention the dragon. Shrek has all this, but it also has more.  The characterisations are superb and it is tightly plotted with a sharp script, and excellent voice choices; Eddie Murphy (The Donkey)is superb, but Mike Myers (Shrek) is even better. Brilliant takes on the traditional Disneyesque animation and characters, and a barrel-load of laughs, a truck-load even.The plot sound conventional; hero on a quest to rescue Princess from dragon blah blah.  But this is a fairy story as Wayne's World might have produced it, and although rated 'U', kids stuff it ain't.  Oh, there is plenty in here for the under 10's, but it is the adults who are going to enjoy this even more.  They are the ones who are going to get the in-jokes and references, and keep alert because there are stacks of 'em.In a nutshell, Lord Farquaad (Lithgow in wonderful form), the evil ruler, has banned all fairy tale creatures and sent them into exile so his Kingdom would be perfect.  Unfortunately, he sent them to the swamp, Shrek's swamp, where he likes to be alone.  In an effort to get his swamp back, Shrek visits Lord F. and ends of being tricked into a quest to rescue the feisty Princess Fiona(Diaz) because Farquaad need to marry a real princess to be a real King. So the quest begins, and Shrek, by this time saddled with the talking Donkey sets off.Along the way they run into the aforementioned dragon, a French Robin Hood with his riverdancing Merry Men and so many visual treats we don't have time to repeat, before delivering the Princess to Farquaad, and getting his swamp back.  BUT.... in the meantime, he has fallen in love with the Princess. But is she all she seems?  Well... nope!Does the 'hero' get his reward?  Ah, that would be telling.  Suffice to say that things did not turn out as our family thought they would!  Yes, it is a 'message' film, but then, fairy stories always were.  But it is not 'preachy'.Incidently, along the way there were some useful fishing tips as well....Shrek will make you laugh, maybe cry, and laugh some more and the music is suitably off-beat (another swing at the saccharine Disney?) with the best rendition of The Monkees, 'I'm a Believer', we've ever heard.  Where does that fit in?  Wait and see the film.Go and see Shrek?  You'd be mad not to."
453,Shrek,,23 June 2001,Hilarious animated comedy,This is an amazingly funny computer animated comedy. I loved it.Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are perfect in their roles.  One word of warning: this is not a children's animated film. The humor is meant for adults.
454,Shrek,9,23 June 2001,"laughs for 10 years, guaranteed","Following a recent trend, Shrek is a spoof on the exact category it's labeled under.  I wasn't too excited on seeing it, however, when I got to the theater 10 minutes late for Tomb Raider, I gave it a shot, and am glad I did.It's one of those movies you can watch when your 10, laugh at all the toilet/bad hygiene jokes, then watch 5-10 years later, and laugh at all the political/dirty jokes.  It tries in vain to break all the rules set for the past 3000 years in fairy tales, and stories in general.  In this, the report card is straight A's.  From the habitat of the hero to the exit of the bad guy, this is as different as you can get.  However, the writers weren't stupid, this wasn't the main goal.  It's an added bonus to the fresh storyline of a ""children's"" cartoon.The computer effects used to make the ENTIRE film are excellent, you can count the grass blades blowing in the wind.  Mike Myers plays a fat man extraordinarily well, taking a cue from his popular ""Fat Bastard"" and making Shrek a hero as well.  Eddie Murphy kept his personality, but doesn't repeat Mushu from Mulan (something I was worried he would do).  Cameron Diaz is a blonde princess... that's about it.  But it's what's required from her role. And Jon Lithgow is hilarious and oblivious to the many cracks made against him.The only minus points came from the predictable ending and Diaz (sorry, but I'm just not a fan).  However, if you compare Shrek's success to Disney's newest effort- Atlantis, I can guarantee you'll forget these minor faults."
455,Shrek,8,25 June 2001,Funny and intelligent...put it on your 'should-see' list!,"Shrek is not earth-shattering, paradigm-shifting, or world-view-altering, so I wouldn't rate it a must-see.  It is, however, a very funny and intelligent movie, with an understated message, and will appeal to all ages (especially if you follow movie business politics or enjoy a little bit of wicked satire).  Take the kids (or don't) and go spend an enjoyable couple of hours watching some solid entertainment...you'll be glad you did."
456,Shrek,,19 May 2001,"A movie that works on ""layers""","""Shrek"" is for everyone.  It is not a cartoon that hopes to follow in the likes of Disney by any means.  It sets its own boundries and stays within them.  Some of the film's humor made me question how Dreamworks could get through the MPAA with this.  There were crude jokes that were sure to offset the conservative growth of a child.  But, oh well.  It was just good, mostly clean, fun.  The script is brilliantly written.  Not because of its story structure, but because of its ability to take jokes and multi-layer them, so that they appeal to kids on one and adults on another.  The joke where Donkey regards the evil King as compensating for a really small ""something"" is a joke I don't even think I'll hear in live-action films for years to come.  Anyway, this is a film destined to be in theaters all summer.  The most fun I have had in a long time."
457,Shrek,,23 June 2001,Spoofy Tale,"A rather delightful film, hilarious and clever with the odd vulgar joke now and again. I doubt that the kids will get all the jokes (some of it assumes prior knowledge) but they'll love the motley of fairy tale characters. My favourite character must be the donkey and his non-stop chatter. While watching this, I was reminded of another film with similar intentions, The Princess Bride. To say that the two films are alike would be misleading but Shrek certainly has resonances of the earlier film: the same kind of tongue-in-cheek references to fairy tales that we know and love so well.A very funny and touching film."
458,Shrek,10,23 June 2001,Adult comedy you can take the kids to!,"Shrek is not just a kids film - don't be fooled by the rating. It's extremely funny and entertaining for audiences of all ages. Like the Simpsons, the kids will enjoy it a lot, but will have more than a few jokes go over their heads.Simply put, this is a classic fairy tale with a wicked twist. You'll see a lot of classic characters in there, but not in the way that you might think. One of the great things about the film is seeing just what they've done with all of the classic fairy tales to fit them in.The performances by all 4 main voice-actors were excellent (Eddie Murphy being the jewel in the crown) and the graphics were amazing.  I don't know if I should really say any more than that - I don't want to give anything away!It should really come as no surprise that this film is doing so well and is _killing_ Pearl Harbour at the box office. Hollywood needs to take a long hard look at this film and work out what the rest of their scriptwriters should be aiming at. See"
459,Shrek,6,23 June 2001,Not funny at all,"This is one of the most over-hyped, underwhelming movie experiences I have ever had.  In short, the story is flat and the humor is empty.  This movie is only enjoyable for those who may be amused by constant ""wink wink"" references to other movies, and low-brow fart and burp jokes.  But for those who demand a richer level of wit, you will be incredibly disappointed. This movie THINKS it is witty and edgy... but even its more mature jokes (i.e. When Shrek remarks ""I think Lord Farquaad is 'compensating' for something"" while staring at the Lord's giant castle), are old, tired, and boring.  I could count the number of times I heartily laughed with one hand.  The great animation aside, this movie is definitely NOT recommended.  1 and a 1/2 stars."
460,Shrek,,21 June 2001,LOL! Hilarious!,"Oh, man, this was a great movie! Take one cup of everything you know about fairy tales, add about 2 cups of funny, plus add a reconized actors cookie, and you have Shrek! PDI has really done the animation this time around (They're best known for Antz and the 3D Homer in an Halloween Episode of The Simpsons), some things are just wonderfully animated! Kids might not get all of the jokes (Think he's compensating for something?), but there's stuff that'll please everyone (Even jaded moviegoers!). Meyers, Murphy, Diaz, and Lithgow were great voice actors. This movie was a real treat, take everyone to see it! Your friends, your family, even the neighbor's dog (Well, not really)! Disney, Pixar and Monsters, INC (Their movie coming out in November) will really have to do a good job if they wanna beat Dreamworks and PDI! That's all I gotta say... GO SEE SHREK!!!"
461,Shrek,9,24 June 2001,This movie really kicked,"All I can say is that this movie really did hit a lot of good points with me and my friends. We were going to either go to this, or to Evolution...and we chose Shrek. Good choice.Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy do an excellent job as isolationist ogre Shrek, and his ever-increasingly talkative Donkey pal. But what really got me were all the parodies on all other movies out there, as well as a plot twist that *I* wouldn't even have expected."
462,Shrek,5,21 June 2001,Basically disappointed.,"I didn't like this movie.First of all, the storyline didn't make sense.  In the beginning of the movie, Lord Farquaad was paying for the Fairy Tale creatures.  When they were all in the swamp the next day, they were saying they were evicted. Then, Farquaad was interrogating the Gingerbread Man regarding the whereabouts of the creatures.  Shrek doesn't want them in his swamp, and so Farquaad offers to clear the swamp if Shrek rescues Princess Fiona.  What is the deal with this?  Does Farquaad want these creatures or not?
I never once laughed out loud.  Every review I have read likens the comedy to some ground-breaking phenomenon.  I found it to be simply about fart jokes and obvious innuendo.  One of the funnier jokes regarding the size of Farquaad's castle is even repeated later in the movie - as if we missed it the first time?The character development is weak.  The only redeeming main character is Eddie Murphy's Donkey.  He was fresh and funny and entertaining.  The Gingerbread Man, unfortunately a small part, was also quite funny.  The rest made me long for the end of the movie.The storyline is a vague string of isolated scenes, resulting in a myriad of continuity problems.The animation is fantastic.  That is the only part of the movie that I enjoyed.  For that, I'll give it 3 stars out of 10."
463,Shrek,9,24 June 2001,Funniest and quite possibly best children's movie ever,"At the beginning of Shrek, the gags are quite gross.  This closed my mind, until Shrek meets the donkey.  Then it is a whole movie of laughter, friendship, and romance. Eddie Murphy is the ""tour de force"" of this movie.  His character is well equipped with great lines and hilarious situations, which keeps you laughing through most of the movie. Mike Myers's Shrek is also played well.  He represents people that are too afraid of what other people think, so he shuns society as society shuns him. But he begins to forge friendships with the donkey and Princess Fiona, which leads to a fairy tale ending (which I won't give away). Lord Farquaad is an evil king who needs to be married to become a king.  He also evicts all the fairy tale characters out of their homes, and tortures the gingerbread man for information. Cameron Diaz's character of Princess Fiona is a woman who has lived a large portion of her life in a castle guarded by a dragon.  She also knows the destiny of imprisoned princesses in fairy tales.  They are rescued by a ""prince charming""  She feels that Shrek and the donkey are scum but they begin to become friends. Even though a recluse and an extrovert are sent on a quest by a midget king to rescue a princess who hates being with the recluse and the extrovert in the beginning, but then they become friends, doesn't sound like too much, it is really a treat for all ages."
464,Shrek,9,24 June 2001,You MUST see this film,"I was fortunate enough to see an advanced preview of this film yesterday (due to lack of advertising of it... which I am not complaining about!) and I am very glad that I did!The cast of Diaz, Lithgrow, Murphy and Myers would mean that hilarity would ensue, especially after seeing the trailers, but it was the level of this that really surprised.  Film companies have been criticised as showing the best bits within the trailers and leaving audiences with nothing good to see.  Not Shrek, there were so many other visual gags and one liners that had you fits, coupled with the background of fairy tales meant that they did have a lot of material to play with.The cast seemed to have gelled well, and on-screen 'voice' relationships are very much there, especially between Myers, Murphy and Diaz and this helped this film too.  The script writers have done a very good job of bringing out the best of their actors and actresses.The animation was very well done throughout the whole film.  Dreamworks once again have shown that they are able to create draw-dropping scenes that could only be beaten by the up-coming Final Fantasy.  The storyline is as much as you would expect it to be.  Well, it's a fairy tale, it could only be happily ever after for all involved, but this was a side issue.  It may not be the formula that is bad, but how it is executed, and this is certainly true of Shrek.  It's obvious but the way that it is done is brilliant.Dreamworks once again have proven that they are kings within the animation field, and are competing healthily after what can be seen as a comeback from Disney with the Emperor's New Groove.Bottom-line, you must see this movie!  Those who thought they would laugh, will kill themselves, those who thought they wouldn't will at least crack a smile, if not a rib!"
465,Shrek,9,23 June 2001,Embarrassing gales of laughter,"I laughed so loud during this movie, I totally embarrassed myself. After seeing Shrek, I truly understood the meaning of the word ""irreverent"". From the titles to the closing song and dance sequence, I was riveted. Each character was fully and wonderfully developed, both on a personal and technical level, but I must say my heart was completely stolen by the Gingerbread Man. Go see Shrek, go, go, go, GO NOW!!!"
466,Shrek,8,18 May 2001,An Entertaining & Amusing Film.,"I've been looking forward to ""Shrek"".  The previews looked great, and I like Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, but the initial few moments of Smashmouth's ""All-Star"" made me first think of ""Mystery Men"", and then ""Why is a Top 40 hit in an animated film set in a fairy tale past?""  Admittedly, all the music specifically designed for the ""film's (naturally) smash soundtrack"" did turn me off a little, and it lost a point for that, as I would have given it a nine easily.  But the rest of the musical score was fine.  Note to filmmakers:  Bad.  Bad.  Don't use ""hip"" marketing ploys in good movies as it only hinders, not helps.As for the rest of the film, I did enjoy it.  Quite a bit, actually.  The CG was simply amazing.  There were several times when the line between ""reality"" and animation was effectively blurred, so technically, it was impressive.  I also had a good time with the story.  ""Shrek"" took a few solid jabs at Disney, such as Lord Farquaad's blatantly theme-park inspired castle to some character designs, to even the goofy song at an inappropriate moment (of which this film pokes even harder fun at).  It also has a few nods to ""Matrix"" and ""Babe"".The film is very, very funny at times.  Mostly in part to the voices, but some characters, such as the Gingerbread Man and Robin Hood made for great scenes.  The dragon was also a really impressive visual treat.From extremely detailed character expressions, to genuine laughs, to a few surprisingly sweet-natured moments, this film offered quite a bit, and even threw in a little ""adult humor"" and profanity at times.  But it's light stuff, so it's not too bad.  I guess besides the Top 40 music, the only other two things I didn't like about the film (but so many other films do it, that I can't singularly criticize this film) is all the ""fart humor"". Another note to filmmakers:  Stop, please.  Enough.  Whoever in Hollywood that is telling you this is prime comedy material is lying to you.  It's not funny.*SPOILER*Also, the film never quite explained what Farquaad did to remove the fairy tale characters from Shrek's swamp, or where they all went until the film's end.*END SPOILER*Despite a few small gripes, I had a good time watching the film, and I could easily recommend it during this summer's movie rush.  Definitely worth a look, and I'll be interested to seeing what special features are offered when it hits for DVD.  Recommended."
467,Shrek,10,23 June 2001,This is the movie to SEE!,"""Shrek,"" is an excellent film for adults and children. It manages to intermingle comedy and morals into a excellent fantasy story. The events that take place in the movie are simple, if they were to get complex, it wouldn't be as pure. Its your standard prince-in-disguise captures princess and saves the day. However, in doing this formula, lovable characters are created. From Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey, Lord Farquaad, to the Gingerbread Man, all the comedy relief and romantic characters are accounted for. Many audience members walk into ""Shrek,"" and leave with a smile. I left with not only a smile, but an understanding of the moral. ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Family films are few and far between where comedy can coincide with morals in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Go see ""Shrek,"" you won't be disappointed. Instead, you'll be whisked away to a fantasy land, and there is no turning back. ****-A+"
468,Shrek,9,21 June 2001,Definitely a must see.,"The best CGI I have seen. I know it keeps getting better as we advance but, really... The plot is excellent with scenes moving smoothly into each other and facial expressions very realistic. The dialogue is fast and witty, and there are are very definite adult themes in the dialogue that kids wouldn't pick up, but you will.I also found this movie very original, though somewhat predictable. Yeah, you know how it's going to end, but the real class is how the movie gets you to the end of the story."
469,Shrek,10,23 June 2001,I've never laughed my butt off so much!,"Fantastic STORY line, great for kids to learn about self image, andself acceptance.  And I LOVED all the disney spoofs!  Worth seeingat least twice.  There is so much detail in this movie it will be easyto miss all the subtlities.  Eddie Murphy's roll steals the show andkeeps the movie rolling along fast.  Before you know it - boom - it'sover."
470,Shrek,7,22 June 2001,Violent Animation,"I found this movie very funny and entertaining, but on the other hand also very violent. I do not want to write a spoiler, so I'll just say that there are at least 3 cruel jokes in the movie, involving a bird, a frog and a snake.The message behind the movie is actually very good. It's talking about not judging someone by his/her appearance. If only the writer/director could be more considerate by not putting on cruel jokes just for the sake of audience's laughter...This movie is totally not for kids. Too bad, because the message is actually very good for kids. Maybe when they release it on DVD, there will be parental lock to cut away those violent scenes."
471,Shrek,9,18 June 2001,Very refreshing after the recent animated Disney releases.,"My family and I truly enjoyed Shrek.  It contained some of the best animation and most realistic graphics to date.  At times it was hard to distinguish whether the graphics were actual video footage, painted or computer generated.  Visually Shrek is refreshing after the recent string of Disney releases where the characters all look alike.In addition to the visual stimulation, the character voices were very well chosen.  The story was well written and effectually dealt with development of relationships between characters of different backgrounds.One of the best films ever!"
472,Shrek,9,18 June 2001,They finally made a movie about me.,"I never thought that I would ever truly like an animated movie.  Boy was I wrong.  After the show, I kept thinking about the great lines throughout. I had to go see it again, and then I realized that I missed so many more great lines.  I do not think a child under 10 or 12 will catch most of the dialogue.  It is just too funny.  Please make more movies like this."
473,Shrek,10,18 June 2001,Funniest movie all year!,The funniest movie since THE FULL MONTY!I've not laughed so hard in ages! The script was great and all of the spoofs and parodies wonderful. I LOVED the dragon! Great stuff!
474,Shrek,9,20 June 2001,"Good, silly fun","So far the best movie of the summer in my opinion.  I really enjoyed Shrek since it was fun for both kids and adults.  Not too many animated movies can be really good for both kids and adults.  Shrek was an excellent parody on Disney, had lots of gross stuff for kids (and twisted adults like me), cool references (the best one was the reference to Bogart/Bacall film - if you need me, whistle), and just a wonderful story where everyone lives happily ever after in the end.HOORAY!"
475,Shrek,8,18 May 2001,Computer overload,"At best, ""Shrek"" is a good, but not great, fairy tale. It's noteworthy for its charming anti-Disney satire, Eddie Murphy's hilarious donkey, some delightful surprises and many uproarious bits. An 8 out of 10, but with a major reservation:""Shrek's"" super-realistic computer animation gets annoying and tiring. What's the point of imitating real-life, when conventional movies -- with some special effects -- can do it more effectively? This story and these characters would have been better served with hand-drawn, clay or plastic animation (as in ""The Iron Giant"" or ""Chicken Run,"" or see the brilliant 1950s and 1960s stuff by John and Faith Hubley). Excessively realistic computer animation takes away from the fantasy. Back to the drawing board!"
476,Shrek,,20 June 2001,funny and cute,"This movie was wonderful. It had great lines (i.e., ""I've got a dragon and I'm not afraid to use it!"") and was a wonderful spoof on fairy tales. An ogre gets sent by a king to rescue a princess, after the king has banished all fairy tale creatures to the ogre's swamp and promises to remove them if the ogre is successful. The princess, however, turns out to be something else.Watch for cameos of fairy tales and otherwise (i.e. the gingerbread man, pinnochio, the three blind mice and others). Heck, just watch the movie. It was absolutely great.*** out of ****"
477,Shrek,9,19 June 2001,"Not just a great movie for kids, but the best movie I've seen all year.","What an amazingly clever and witty film.  It succeeds as a movie to thoroughly entertain children, but also one that adults will also find extremely funny.  The animation and fairy tale story will get to the kids, and the humor, with references to ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", Otis Redding, the Monkees, and the Errol Flynn version of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and the sendup of a lot of Disney films (do you think that Jeffrey Katzenberg now feels as if he's gotten even with Michael Eisner?) will appeal to the adults.My wife and I took our kids to see ""Shrek"" to entertain them.  As much as they liked it (and they liked it a lot).  We liked it more.  It also sounded like the cast of the film had a lot of fun making it."
478,Shrek,10,19 June 2001,very good,great movie. humor for both young and old. the graphics are very well done. the cameos by other fairy tales characters is a nice touch. the best movie i've seen so far this year. a shame chris farley didn't live long enough to finish this movie but mike myers does a great job. worth seeing.
479,Shrek,9,18 June 2001,Dreamworks' best animation,"Shrek is without a doubt the best animation out of the Dreamworks studios. The reason is very simple: Finally they made a film for all ages, which will not bore little children and attract adults also. The story is simple but not annoying. The characters are fun and well made.The big problem with former Dreamworks animation movies (both computer animation and cartoon) was that they weren't able to create a cast that was fun for children and adults. AntZ was fun if you were old enough to understand the philosophy but boring for the little kiddies (Bugs life had way more fun characters), Prince of Egypt was much to serious to attract young children (I wonder if they attend to make it a film for children) and Small Soldiers might have been to aggressive. The road to El Dorado came close. A funny adventure tale in 'Disney' style, but again with a lack of fun creatures. Children enjoy those things (every Disney film has two or more of such characters). But now with Shrek they have solved that problem.
The Ogre who seems evil outside carries a great hart within, The Princess who (for her own reason) understands that beauty doesn't always come from the outside, the evil want-to-be-king villain who seeks for the ultimate power and the Donkey (a great Eddie Murphy) who gives us the regular laughter like the best Disney characters do.All I hear or read about this movie is that it is the best since Toy Story 2. Sorry but I liked this one more. Maybe because this was more like a fairy tale fantasy (my kind of movies). That and because the great vocal cast (Cameron Diaz as the princess, Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as the Donkey and a great John Lithgow as Lord Farquaad, the villain) made me give this movie a 9 out of 10."
480,Shrek,,16 June 2001,didn't like mean-spirited gags,"I saw Shrek today with my wife and two kids (6 and 8). It was fairly entertaining, but there were several mean spirited gags which we found to be really sad and distracting. One was the ""princess/bird"" gag, another concerned a gingerbread man. Some people rave about this kind of humor, but we were really turned off (my 8-year old used the term ""mean spirited""). It is rated PG for a reason; not suitable for young kids. We have never let our kids watch TV, so they are not conditioned for a lot of the stuff that may be prevalent. Flatulence and the like is innocuous (not exactly groundbreaking) but these other gags really subtracted from the film and seemed utterly gratuitous. I'd give it 3 out of 4 stars and would recommend it to teen aged kids and adults."
481,Shrek,8,18 May 2001,A case of the whole being better than the sum of the parts,"I really enjoyed ""Shrek.""  I was engaged throughout, and was, at times, even moved.  However, when I considered the film I realized there were some less than satisfactory elements.  Somehow, the film manages to rise above them and achieve a sort of ingratiating brilliance.The plot, about a curmugeon ogre named Shrek who is just out for some quiet and sanctuary who gets roped into rescuing the Princess Fiona, ingenuously uses and pokes at fairy tale (And Disney movie) conventions.  There are plenty of grin-worthy moments, especially from Eddie Murphy's charming sidekick Donkey, but few laugh out loud funny moments, or any lines I can recall after the fact.  And while there's little at fault with Mike Myers' performance as Shrek, he really isn't giving the audience anything new. This Scottish voice was hilarious on SNL, funny during ""So I Married An Axe Murderer"" and getting old during ""Austin Powers.""But despite these quibbles, ""Shrek"" has a way of getting under your skin. Diaz's performance is wonderful (So is her character's animation, wonderfully intricate), and the more ""sappy"" stuff in the picture actually works better than some of the comedy.  One sequence involving Shrek and the Princess at their lonliest is both visually superb, and suprisingly moving.Even if I can't quite put my finger on what made the film so enjoyable, I can't deny the fact that it was.  For whatever reason, the film has an easygoing charm, an almost effortless quality to it (On a film that took several years to make, and cost how many gads of millions of dollars).  Kids will enjoy it, and adults will too.  I'm a ""man"" of 20, and I enjoyed it just as much as my younger sibling, and my two parents.  As Jeff Craig as it might sound, it's a great family film."
482,Shrek,10,18 June 2001,I've Seen it Twice in 2 weeks & will see it again soon - I LOVED it!,"I give this one a 10 because everything about it was excellent in my book. The imagination, the intelligence, the music, the visuals such a delight for the eye, the fun, the humor, the warmth of the characters, and the beautiful thought that one can be loved for something other than physical beauty.  I am a mentor for grade school children and I just cringe when children want to read Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella because these stories place such importance on the fact that the heros and heroines are physically beautiful people and villains are portrayed as ugly.  When the little girls look up at me, I can see the looming question in their eyes ""Am I beautiful?"".  Of course, I am quick to assure them that they are.  But the fact is most of them aren't and never will be even close to Fairy Princess beauty. Reading fairy-tales and watching films and television, I too often find myself wishing society would give these children a fighting chance for self confidence by teaching them to appreciate each other more for who they are rather than their lovely long blonde hair and perfect, sensual physique. Shrek is a movie I would be proud to show an impressionable child or an intelligent adult who recognizes the product of an extremely talented group of film makers when they see it. A special ""Bravo!"" to Randy Cartwright."
483,Shrek,,15 June 2001,SHREK is great?  Maybe in comparison...,"I enjoyed SHREK, but not a lot.  It had a couple of big laughs in it (the Gingerbread Man steals the show), but overall it wasn't very funny. Everyone says it slams Disney, but all I see is adherence to the same old formulas.  Characters wallow in self-pity, discover their inner beauty and fall in love.  It may be different in the details (it's crass, ugly, and aims more at the lowest common denominator of audience appeal... ie fart jokes), but overall, it's not that different.  It's no LION KING or SECRET OF NIMH in terms of story, character, heart or artistry -- especially artistry.  The production and art design for SHREK is hideous.  There is no unified look for the film, no mastery of color scheme or layout.  ANTZ had this same problem.  SHREK looks clunky and, well, computer-animated. Everyone may praise PDI's efforts, but PIXAR can blow them out of the water any day.  Just look at TOY STORY or BUG'S LIFE -- better character animation, more range of expression in the characters' faces, and above all -- better design at work, mastery of color.  It's art to me.  SHREK is just another movie hitting big because it happens to be the best of the litter at this point in time."
484,Shrek,,17 June 2001,Personality rules!,"One thing that has been missing from a lot of animated films in recent years has been personality.  The quickly drawn computer animations have been cranked out, especially by Disney, not to primarily entertain audiences but rather to sell company merchandise that follows.  'Shrek' follows a familiar pattern of romance and friendship but has great production values and some wonderful personality developments.  Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are all perfect in lending their voices to the appropriate character. 'Shrek' is probably the best animated movie since 'The Lion King' (1994) or perhaps even as far back as Disney's 'Aladdin' (1992) or 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991)."
485,Shrek,9,18 May 2001,A great new twist on all of the old stuff.,"This movie is a wonderful blend of fantasy, comedy, adult humor, and childish whimsy.  A blatantly off-the-wall film, it earns chuckles and outright laughs with a greater frequency than any movie I have seen in quite a while, and it is always s joy to hear a theater full of people laugh along with you.  Unlike most movies, and especially comedies, the vast majority of the good parts, as well as many of the crucial plot points and twists, were left out of the trailer.  Though it was not hard to figure out what was going to happen in the end, the details of the road they take to get there are completely unpredictable and delightfully surprising. The visuals were beautiful, but after the first few moments you forget them unless you consciously pay attention, which is how all visuals and special effects should be.  If you were spending the whole movie oohing and aahing, you would miss all of the funny parts and maybe take this movie seriously, which you are obviously not supposed to do.  The wonderful visual effects are so believable that you can forget that you are, in essence, watching a cartoon, while still maintaining a fantastical quality throughout. Another great point about this movie was that the jokes that may not be suitable for children are so subtle done that the vast majority of the youngsters will not even notice that they are not getting a joke.  This is truly a great family film that you can take kids to, or see by yourself. Yes, there is a lot of ""gross-out"" humor, but hopefully you are not going to see this movie with visions of Shakespeare running through your head. Go to see this movie, and before you do you should change the channel every time a preview comes on, the minimal previews cannot last for long."
486,Shrek,10,13 June 2001,Shrek brings out the kid in all,Oooh the pleasure of fairy tales; fractured and original.  This movie was a pure delight.  A large portion of the audience were children totally engrossed in the movie; you could hear a pin drop.  The children were so precious laughing throughout the movie.  The adults were laughing just as hard.It was unpredictable and pleasant to watch.  It will go into my home collection.  Bravo for the creativity.
487,Shrek,10,13 June 2001,A New Journey: An Adults View,"When looking at the previews for Shrek, I thought it was going to be an animation blast, but at a child's mentality. Was I wrong! The film looks at the other side of life: That of the ogre who lives alone and is happy yet missing something. What that is, you decide for yourself. Shrek plays the part of the ogre for the village, scaring them away from his home. He does so with humor and wit, yet never forgetting that he will always be seen as the horrible, green monster that he is.Also, the humor in this movie is ""layered"" for all ages, so you can see that their is more to ""Shrek"" than meets the eye.It takes a Donkey, a quest, and a Princess, to make Shrek see that he is more than just what people see. He is a friend, a hero, and a knight in ""small"" armor, that makes this movie more than your average fairy tale."
488,Shrek,10,12 June 2001,the best movie of the year!!!!!,"being a lover of all movies, i have never had so much fun in my movie experience life !!!!!!  I am such a movie lover, love all types, and so many move me and have such impact, yet this one has brought me the most joy!!!! :)  ..............i laughed and laughed...........i felt myself moved by every character.............and the spoofs (tongue 'n cheek) was amazing........................ I so love the fact that today the industry is actually creating ""family"" movies..........where the parents can and do have has much fun as the kids...............sometiimes almost more so!!!!!!!!!!!!Shrek is absolutely my favorite of the year!!!!!!!!!!!!"
489,Shrek,,13 June 2001,Disney has lost there touch,"The movie was bright and colorful and full of slap stick laughs, yet where was the Magic?  That is the Disney magic!  Where was the Disney made music? This show lacking so that I felt my daughters cheated from the experience I was given when I was little going to a Disney movie.  Although I do say they stroy line and  charaters were good, It just was not Beauty and the Beast!"
490,Shrek,10,12 June 2001,my favorite movie!!!!!!,being a major movie fan..and loves the serious movies.. i have never had more fun....and i have never recommended a movie more..... !!!!!! am not a big comedy person....but with this movie you don't need to be!!!!.this movie is the best..you laugh.and laugh..and laugh.. you don't even need kids to go see this movie..this is what movies are all about....something inventive....enlightning..spiritually lifting...just an amazing joyous experience.... i take all my movies very seriously...and never had i had such fun...and walked away feeling so incredibly happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
491,Shrek,9,13 June 2001,Couldn't stop laughing!,"I have very little to add to the comments on shrek, but I just want to say that Shrek is one of the best comedies I've seen the last year. Very good performances by Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers and ofcourse Cameron Diaz!Don't miss it!"
492,Shrek,10,11 June 2001,Amazing and Surprising,"If you have to see one film this year, this is the one.  And to those who hated it or didn't get it, well they are missing out.  The film is so funny at times you almost feel like you're going to die.Awesome.  Brilliant.  Breath-taking.Go See This FILM."
493,Shrek,,18 May 2001,The whole family should enjoy this cute story.,"3 1/2 out of 5Children's stories and fairy tales are rarely complicated.  A simple moral, teaching kids (and even adults) life's lessons, is best told through unique characters and comical situations.  Shrek has a good grasp of this concept making it a truly enjoyable film, one with a message.Shrek (Mike Myers) is a large, green, ill-mannered and downright gross ogre who spends his time eating slugs, washing up in his stinky swamp and scaring the town folk who misunderstand him.  His life is simple and that's the way he likes it.  But things change when his humble home becomes a haven for fairy tale creatures banished by Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).  In order to regain his life, Shrek, along with unwanted help from Donkey (Eddie Murphy), must rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the mighty dragon and bring her to Farquaad, a name which needs careful pronunciation in a PG film.Missing are the wonderful Disney tunes you've come to expect from animated classics, but on the other hand Shrek's writers know their competition and do a fair job of making fun of what's expected.  By mixing modern day culture (elevator music, parking lots and WWF wrestling) with classic fairy tale standards a cute and entertaining story is told.  The best lines are given to Donkey where Murphy's comic nature allows him to steal the show.Overall the animation was slightly wooden (no I'm not refering to Pinnochio's cameo) and I had trouble with the voice Myer's gave to Shrek. His higher pitched Scottish inflections reminded me too much of characters he's played in the past.  Also be prepared for some off-color humor that will more than likely slip by the kids unnoticed unless it happens to be the bathroom kind.  It's a must see for families."
494,Shrek,9,12 June 2001,"The best animated comedy feature since ""Aladdin""","This movie is a gem.It has amazing state-of-the-art animation, a killer script and the perfect cast. Mike Myers (Shrek) a-la Fat Bastard, Eddie Murphy (Donkey) talking-talking-talking, John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad) your typical villain and Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona) your not-so-typical damsel-in-distress.Adults will enjoy it just as much as the kids (especially the bits that float straight over the kids' heads).The story is based upon the standard fairy-tale, but it's been sliced and diced by some twisted comedic minds.Haven't laughed that hard since ""Austin Powers"".  [9/10]"
495,Shrek,10,11 June 2001,I laughed so hard,"The first movie in a long time, that my wife and I have gone to. Where the theater was packed and we had to sit in the front. There were people of all ages, and we all laughed(belly laughed) at the same time. I really enjoyed it and will see it again. My only compliantwas, that the movie was too short. I wanted it to go on and on..."
496,Shrek,9,12 June 2001,Whacked out and fun,"This movie has been getting rave reviews and doing phenomenal numbers at the box office for weeks now. I wasn't really sure why as the commercials for it weren't showing a whole lot. Until recently I wasn't sure I was going to see this movie but on whim, I decided to go and now I know why it's been doing so well. This movie is charming, funny and well told. Shrek (Mike Myers) is a giant green ogre that lives by himself in a swamp. He likes his privacy and is thrown into a fit of despair when all the forest's fairy tail creatures show up at his place. They're there because the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) sent them there after he banished them all from his land. Having his privacy intruded by all these creatures and by a particularly annoying fast talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), he sets off for Farquaad's castle to rectify the problem. And so begins a journey of adventure, love and self-discovery for not only Shrek but also the princess he rescues, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).I've read some other reviews and there are those that think this movie was over hyped, insensitive to short people and just not very good. I think if you look hard enough you will find almost anything to pick apart. If it's not short people, then it's big fat bald people or the abuse that a donkey takes so I'm not going to put a lot of stock in those who pick things like these out. Look at any Saturday morning cartoon and you'll probably see far worse things. It's a Hollywood movie so put your issues and beliefs aside and enjoy it for what it was, a fun summer movie. The animation was incredible. Animation technology has been advancing at lightning speeds and we saw some of it here. Toy Story 1 & 2 were incredibly well done but Shrek seemed to be a bit better in the emotions department. The character of Shrek exhibited a lot of emotions that I haven't really seen before and the donkey must have been an animator's dream to create. Talk about artistic freedom and as a result, a thoroughly entertaining character. You really do feel a sense of connection with these characters because of how well they were able to exhibit emotions. In some ways I thought that the evil Lord wasn't quite evil enough. I thought that he could have been a bit more menacing but I guess there are some restrictions considering the movie was meant for children. I loved the spoofs they did. I've seen them before in other movies like `Scary Movie' but it was kind of funny to see it in an animation. The real world and fantasy world seemed to have merged with these spoofs and it really created a sense of summer fun.To be quite honest I didn't see many things that I didn't like or thought were weaknesses and judging by the dollars it's doing, a lot of others think the same way. If you want to see a sweet, charming and very funny movie, see Shrek. And guys, this is a great date movie. She'll love it and think you're the `Shrek' of her heart."
497,Shrek,8,10 June 2001,"Animation for adults, but still clean enough for Kids","I watched Shrek last night and must say I was impressed.After recently watching The Emperors New Groove and being disappointed, Shrek was a pleasant surprise in the normally kid dominated genre (animation - manga people don't get defensive now.)Shrek managed to provide both a fun ride for Adults and kids a like, but I'm sure lots of the jokes passed the little tykes by.8/10"
498,Shrek,,10 June 2001,The immoral to the story is...,"Since so many people have raved about Shrek, I keep reviewing it in my head to try to find SOME reason I should like it.  But for every plus I uncover, I uncover another minus.  My biggest question of all is this: if the moral of the story is supposed to be that you shouldn't judge people (or ogres) by appearances, why is it considered acceptable, even encouraged, to make fun of someone because he's short?  At this point I give up. So if you think passing gas and using toilet paper are funny, see Shrek.  If you've never noticed before that ""ass"" can mean either ""donkey"" or ""butt"", see Shrek.  If you're not tired of seeing send-ups of the camera work in ""The Matrix"", see Shrek.  If you don't know the meaning of the word ""hackneyed"", see Shrek.  In all, if you are willing to put up with a script with a total of 3 or 4 clever lines and a theme that contradicts itself just to get to see some mildly interesting technology and about 4 or 5 or 6 clever sight gags, see Shrek.  But a better idea would be just to rent Toy Story again..."
499,Shrek,9,10 June 2001,Why I liked Shrek,"I thought Shrek was an extremely entertaining movie for (almost) the whole family.  My 5-year-old daughter and I went to see it and were both almost constantly laughing (or crying!).  Shrek is somewhat like Toy Story II and the like in that it has plenty of humor that keeps kids rolling, along with a substantial amount of humor that goes ""over their heads"" (either because of double-meanings or references to things that predate the child's existence) that we adults can appreciate.  I do not think Shrek is the ""model"" children's movie, but it was certainly acceptable.  I did find a couple things (a small bit of profanity and flatulence, for example) a bit inappropriate, but it gave me an opportunity to discuss appropriate behavior with my daughter."
500,Shrek,9,8 June 2001,Fun for all ages!,"DreamWorks has done it!  They delivered a masterpiece of a fractured fairy-tale, complete with every character from every fairy tale you can possibly remember, though they all seem to need therapists.  Shrek (Mike Myers) isn't your traditional dashing-hero-to-the-rescue.  Instead, he is a rather bitter, slightly Scottish ogre who just wants to be left alone.  Hard to do when your only companion is a donkey (Eddie Murphy) who won't shut up. Off the pair go to a (typical) shadowed castle guarded by an fiery pink dragon to save the Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a woman who is not what she seems.  Their ultimate goal is to get Fiona to the castle to marry Lord Farquad (John Lithgow), a rather diminutive man who makes up for what he lacks in a decidedly Freudian way.  Seamlessly, DreamWorks brings this diverse cast together in a work of computer-generated artistic brilliance. The story carries itself effortlessly, smattered here and there with adult-themed jokes but child friendly fun.  The animation is fantastic.  It has more depth than any other computer generated film that came before it. The action sequences (odd to think there would be any in an animated flick) are hilarious and will leave you in tears.  Take everyone you can round up to this movie!!  You will all enjoy it!!Score - 10 out of 10!"
501,Shrek,9,8 June 2001,Oh so funny,"This movie is funny on so many levels.  It is by no means a film exclusively for children.  Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow are perfect for their roles in this outing. The animation is absolutely fantastic with a very keen eye for some of the details that others in the past have let slip.  It is one of only a handful of movies that I have seen more than once in the theatre."
502,Shrek,8,7 June 2001,Great family entertainment,Shrek is great family entertainment.  This movie is fine for everyone in the family and everyone will enjoy it no matter what your age is.  Its heartwarming and hilarious. I loved every minute!  Go see this soon to be favorite family classic!
503,Shrek,10,10 June 2001,A hilarious and giant twisted fairytale!,"I just saw this in the theater today, and I have to say I love it! This is a very funny movie. It has a lot of fairy tale excerpts twisted into a comedy, and Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow add to the movie's funniness. The movie is very funny itself. This is a very funny movie and it is recommended to anyone. This is a classic! VERY funny! I give it a 9 out of 10!"
504,Shrek,,10 June 2001,Saw it yesterday...,"... loved it. Heh heh, I just love the gingerbread man scene... hee heee. And thet part where Princess Fiona sings with the bird... heh. there some very clever jokes mixed in, which will keep the adult crowd as entertained as the 10 and under sect. I had to take my little sister to see it, and I came out entertained. Definately worth the money (but hey, my bro works at the movies, so I get free tickets =P)."
505,Shrek,10,8 June 2001,Best Movie Of The Year,"What a delight...Great story with the twists and turns. Funny, clever,the art work and animation are simply fantastic. Can't think of any other movie animation ever that was better. Period. This is a must see film and as the word spreads it should stay near the top for a long time. Got to be a $250,000,000 plus film."
506,Shrek,10,17 May 2001,A fine piece of cinema.,"I won't keep you in suspense. This is a great movie. In fact, it's the greatest film I've seen this year. Shrek is the latest release from DreamWorks Pictures and, by my count, the fifth fully computer animated major motion picture.DreamWorks itself is a really great company. After all, it was started by three guys with enough money and enough integrity that they can afford to take the time to carefully select projects to work on. This means they can devote their resources exclusively to what look like quality films. Go to their Web site and see the list. While they're not all winners, you'll see that they've already given the world a really fine body of work.Shrek revolves around the exploits of an ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) who's on a quest to get his swamp back from the local government. This government is personified by one Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Farquaad has decided to round up all the magical fairy tale characters in the land and put them into what is basically an internment camp. As this camp just happens to be on Shrek's land, he inadvertently becomes their hero and liberator when he sets off to confront Farquaad about the matter.Farquaad wants to be a king, but for that to happen he must marry a princess. With a little help from the magic mirror, he locates the three most eligible candidates and eventually settles upon Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) who lives in the tallest tower of a castle waiting for true love. As Farquaad doesn't really feel like rescuing Fiona himself, when Shrek arrives, a deal is struck to exchange the deed to the swamp for the rescued princess.I just can't say enough about how good this movie is. It's smart, it's funny, it's entertaining; you name it, it's got it. This is truly what family cinema is supposed to be like. Family cinema should, by definition, appeal to all ages, and this film does an excellent job. There's humor for everyone here. Like Antz, the film contains subversively planted, more adult-oriented jokes and even some mild profanity. A scene in which Farquaad tortures a gingerbread man is absolutely priceless, as are dozens of clever references to every fairy tale, nursery rhyme and fable imaginable. Picture a movie with as many subtle jokes as a two-hour Simpsons episode.The voice talent is great. I never would have thought of Mike Myers, a relatively small guy, to be the voice of a giant ogre, but he does a wonderful job. Eddie Murphy is very funny as Donkey and has some of the best lines in the film. Cameron Diaz is no stranger to comedy after films like The Mask, There's Something About Mary, and Charlie's Angels and her voice works great with an animated body that's almost as hot as she is. Finally, John Lithgow is brilliant as the maniacal Farquaad. The physical resemblance between these actors and their computer-animated counterparts is apparent, but not overstated. Everything fits perfectly.The CGI employed in Shrek is, as one might expect, light years beyond anything we've seen thus far. In the close ups, every hair, every pore is visible making this amazing world cartoon-like yet photo-realistic all at once. The music in the film is also particularly noteworthy. It's a mix of contemporary hits and original score and the two work well together and with the story.I've seen Shrek twice now and it was every bit as enjoyable the second time, so I suggest you do so as well. If ever a movie was worth your seven-fifty, this is it. Take your friends, take your siblings, take your mom. With everything from a fire-breathing dragon to break-dancing pigs, Shrek is not to be missed."
507,Shrek,,7 June 2001,What's everyone getting their panties in a twist about?,"DreamWorks' cheeky bet-the-farm big animated movie: a Fractured Fairy Tale in which a green, boiler-shaped ogre (voicedby Mike Myers) and a princess locked up in a castle (CameronDiaz) discover they have more body-image problems than thedramatis personae of Todd Solondz's life work. There's somethinglikable about the movie, particularly the rendering of Shrek and hissidekick, a non-stop-jabbering donkey (Eddie Murphy). Not likableenough, though, to justify Diaz's weird non-performance, or theessentially ugly visual landscape of computer-generatedanimation, or the uncertain wrtiting. How bizarre is it that JeffreyKatzenberg seems to have made a second career mocking hisown Disney experience. At one point, a BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-like song bursts out, and Diaz comments ""Ecch, howannoying!"""
508,Shrek,9,4 June 2001,A fun film for all ages,"I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend for anyone wanting to watch a fun film.  Very smart script that totally bashed Disney corp's traditional ""fairy tale"" roles.  It's refreshing to see this type of movie come out after being accustomed to those traditional ""feel good"" family movies of Disney taking all your money away."
509,Shrek,8,4 June 2001,"Okay, but not as good as I was hoping","I thought the film was entertaining, and had a good theme. I did not, however, feel it was very funny.  It had its moments, but overall wasn't very funny.  Not a bad film, just not as good as I had hoped."
510,Shrek,9,3 June 2001,"Entertaining, but not for little kids","This was a very entertaining movie.  The visuals were excellent, and the dialogue walked a fine line between being funny for adults and funny for children.  In fact, this movie isn't a good one for young children to see, hence the PG rating.  That should be the first clue for those parents who have taken young children to see it, that they may not understand it.However, this movie is extremely biting and funny for adults.  Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow do a great job with the subtle in-jokes. Eddie Murphy is probably the only person in the world who could take the obnoxious donkey and make him as funny and memorable as he did.  He provides most of the jokes for the younger members of the audience.The story was very predictable, but the movie wasn't really about the story, it was more about the in-jokes, wicked satirical comedy sequences (Robin Hood, the singing bird, Gingerbread Man, etc...) and witty dialogue.  And that is where you get your money's worth. 9/10"
511,Shrek,10,17 May 2001,So good it hurt...,"Rather than go into a full critique, let me just say this... a large soda started an hour before we were let into the screening meant that I should have darted out to the lobby about halfway through the film. The fact that I spent the last hour of it in intense pain, risking kidney damage rather than missing a single minute of Shrek should speak for itself."
512,Shrek,,1 June 2001,"Great graphics, predictable story","I took my 11 year old daughter to see this movie, and she really liked it. I was tremendously impressed with the CGI, but the story was too predictable. I thought some of the action was a little too topical (no real spoilers, but beware), such as characters doing the lambada, and a wrestling match. Future (years from now, that is) movie goers may see that and wince. Overall, I enjoyed it. Myers did a good job with the Scottish accent. Some of the action may be too intense for very young (5 and under) children. Definitely worth seeing, though."
513,Shrek,8,1 June 2001,The first animated feature I've been excited about in a long time.,"My only regret about seeing Shrek right away is that I didn't brush up on my fairy tale lore first.  I thought the film was hilarious, and I would have doubtlessly found it even funnier if I had caught half the references I surely would have years ago when the source material was fresh in my mind. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the fact it appeals to everyone. There's enough action for the younger kids, with enough inside jokes and movie references for the old ones.  I'm a huge fan of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's writing, and they didn't disappoint me on this one.  I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to have a good laugh, see a great piece of cinema, or both."
514,Shrek,9,1 June 2001,"simple, elegant, laugh-to-tears comedy","I thought this was a great send-up of Disney-esque fairy tales and popular culture, all set in the often trite, overused mythical land of knights, dragons, and ogres.  Two things that really made this movie work for me was the superb use of the latest CGI technology (rendering light & shadow, facial expressions, grass, fabric, hair, etc.) as well as the exceptional match-up of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as a comedy team.  They bounce off each other really well; I understand that the director used their improvs beyond the script to give their characters extra charm and life, and their casual off-the-cuff chatter really works!The spoofs are fast and relentless (The Matrix, Babe, WWF wrestling, Jurassic Park, etc.) and had me laughing so hard I would miss the next lines of dialogue... and despite the fact that the story was tied up in a neat little package in the end (c'mon, what fairy tale doesn't, hmmm?), I found it very, very amusing and would suggest this movie to anyone wanting a good escapist storyline.  I suggest going to it with an open mind and just go along for the ride; also, it's one of the few I would recommend seeing on the big screen, as I fear it would lose a lot of the colors and fine details on the home tube.As far as bringing kids to it, the toilet jokes are few and far between, and it has its share of ""eww, gross"" maggot and earwax gags, but let's give our children some credit, they're a lot smarter than we think... and I think it holds an appeal to the under-13 crowd as well."
515,Shrek,10,4 June 2001,Definitely a masterpiece...,"Shrek not only was very well animated and had a great plot, but also had amazing voice talents.  Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow really brought this movie to life.  Definitely the best digitally animated film yet.  I've seen this movie four times, and i'm still not sick of it.  I work at a movie theater and everyone there has seen it more than once and loved it too.  If you haven't seen this film yet, you're really missing out.  It's spectacular!"
516,Shrek,,1 June 2001,Fun family movie that includes some adult humor,"This is a fun family movie that will include the adults.  The animation in the movie is great.  The storyline is a little thin but, I didn't go to this movie expecting much else. If you want a funny movie to see with the kids this could be it."
517,Shrek,,4 June 2001,Much better than expected.,"What's not to like?  It's funny at all levels, both kids and adults will enjoy it.  It serves up the unexpected at several points, and Eddie Murphy is brilliant.The computer animation is better than just about anything I have seen to date.  One thing that is particularly impressive is how the they manage an incredible sense of scale -- when you see Faarquad's or the dragon's castle you get a definite sense of hugeness.  That's hard to achieve in any animation.  The dynamic resolution reveals stunning attention to detail.Definitely worth seeing."
518,Shrek,9,17 May 2001,Gorgeous,"A funny, witty, original mixture of biting, gross-out AND subtle humor, of satire and romance. And yet the film also has a great sense for tenderness. Eddie Murphy is simply hilarious. (The thought of him being dubbed gives you the shivers!) Of all the NEW films shown in Cannes this was the best."
519,Shrek,,31 May 2001,Funny  Movie,I have taken my kids to see this movie twice. I enjoyed it very much. It entertains adults as well as kids. ***** (5 stars).....
520,Shrek,9,3 June 2001,"So What Do You Say To A Big, Green Ogre?","A fractured fairy tale if there ever was one, `Shrek,' directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is a highly imaginative, animated comedy that has something in it for everyone.  It's funny, witty, at times gross, while at other times, poignant.  And there's plenty of humor for children of all ages, while the adult humor (with which it's loaded) is for the most part implied, so parents can rest easy sitting next to their eight-or-ten-year-old sons or daughters; there's nothing in this film that's going to cause any embarrassing moments, and the only question you're likely to hear when it's over is, `Can we see it again?'	When the local Monarch, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decrees that his kingdom must be rid of all fairy tale creatures, he has them rounded up and deposited across the line, as it were, into a swamp that just happens to belong to a big green Ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers).  Much to his chagrin, as he happens to value his privacy above all else, Shrek soon finds himself bedeviled by a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), as well as having his sensibilities assaulted by the hordes of fairy tale squatters who don't have a clue as to what to do next.  Quickly Shrek sees no recourse but to go to Farquaad himself and settle the matter without further ado.  And when they meet, the diminutive Farquaad strikes a bargain with Shrek; it seems that in order to become a real King, Farquaad must marry a Princess.  But his chosen one, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), is currently being held captive in the highest tower of a castle guarded by a fierce dragon who has slain all that have attempted to rescue her.  If Shrek can successfully effect her release, Farquaad promises to restore his swamp and rid Shrek of the pesky fairy tale creatures encamped there.  The fearless Shrek agrees, and with the donkey in tow, sets off on his quest.	Besides the humor, the wide appeal of this movie is due in part to the many clever references to other movies, stories and cultural icons it incorporates so well into the story.  There's the fairy tale's themselves, of course, like `Snow White,' `Pinocchio' and `Cinderella;' and movies like `The Matrix,' as well as the cultural phenomenon of `Riverdance.'  There's a scene that fans of professional wrestling will get a hoot out of, and the scene involving Princess Fiona and Robin Hood and his dancing band of Merry Men is beyond hilarious.  There is some bathroom humor, as well, but it's fairly brief and inoffensive-- miles away from anything remotely resembling what you'd expect to find in the latest Jim Carrey movie. 
	The actors supplying the voices do a great job, especially Mike Myers who brings Shrek so vividly to life, complete with a Scottish accent.  Murphy has some great lines as the donkey and makes the most of them, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona is perfect, as is Lithgow as Lord Farquaad.  Other notable voices are supplied by Vincent Cassel (Monsieur Hood), Kathleen Freeman (The Old Woman) and Conrad Vernon (Gingerbread Man).  The use of music in this film is exceptional, also.  A number of familiar, popular songs are integrated into the story and the action to great effect throughout, and repeatedly, the filmmakers seemed to have an innate sense of knowing just the right song to plug into any particular moment or scene.  As with virtually everything else about this movie, it all came together beautifully.  In the final analysis, `Shrek' is an innovative, entertaining movie for the whole family that is guaranteed to keep you laughing and smiling for a lot longer than the 89 minutes it's on the screen.  This one's going to have you chuckling for the rest of the day-- and beyond.  And it all comes down to one thing.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."
521,Shrek,,3 June 2001,It's not easy Venting Spleen....,"At least for Herr Katzenberger, Dreamworks/ex Disney head honcho, piling onto some of his own works there-Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, etc with a ton of parody and satire all throughout the flick. Most of it works, some of it, well-doesn't. When they try and get all serious towards the end here, with a 'secret character twist' you can see coming 40 miles away-it's a case of wanting to have yer cake and eat it too, seems to me. Blazing Saddles funny this ain't.That said, I liked the voices, the action(gotta like the dragon fight), though Eddie Murphy does get tiring as the yakky donkey after awhile. Still it was pretty involving and funny throughout, Myers as Shrek does a good job too.Check it out, not better than 'Bugs Life' or 'Aladdin', but hardly inferior either.*** outta **** or so, kinda good."
522,Shrek,,3 June 2001,Utterly charming and highly entertaining.,"As Shrek opens up, you realize that you're not going to be viewing a ""classic"" fairy tale.  With a very irreverant sense of humor, the film ventures into uncharted territories that will make you laugh uncontrollably while your kids wonder what's so funny.  The story is a simple one.  Shrek and Donkey have been given a task of rescuing Princess Fiona.  Once this is accomplished, Lord Farquuad will remove the fairy tale refugees from Shrek's swamp.  Along the way in this simple tale, our hero learns to open himself up to others, and by midway through the film you'll know the outcome.  But, you will be so charmed and entertained by the story that you won't care that you figured out the ending in the middle of the film.  The animation is amazing to watch, and with the field of animation, you can get away with many things that you can not do with live action.  Overall, Shrek is a delightful film for all ages.   Take the kids and try not to be charmed."
523,Shrek,,30 May 2001,"I think the movie was delightful, yet there were a few things that ""bugged"" me","I know it seems miniscule to many, yet the part where they blew up the frog and the snake as balloons, although ""humorous"", was seen by me as cruel and did not set well with me.  Yes, it's just a movie, but many many kids are seeing this movie and have a hard time separating fantasy from reality and may think this is a possible ""fun"" thing to do to frogs.Frogs are disappearing at an alarming rate from our earth and they do undergo a great deal of abuse in our ""civilized"" world; ie., dissection, road-kill, scientific experimentation, etc.  Kids have been known to ""blow up"" frogs, thereby killing them.  I did not see this as funny.  I would like to see animal abuse taken out of the next film.  I don't think it is necessary in order to make a film ""cute""."
524,Shrek,,3 June 2001,A new fairy tale for a new generation.,"""Shrek"" is all at once a beautiful fairy tale with all the trappings, a wonderful spoof of such fairytales, a hysterical comedy, and a wonderful display of modern CGI.This wonderful family oriented film features the voice talents of Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), Eddie Murphy (Donkey) and John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad).  All bring their animated counterparts to life and make them all likeable characters in their own ways.  Eddie Murphy's Donkey clearly steals the movie however, providing comedy relief in a manner that shows not only how good the writing for this film was, but also that shows how much he has begun to grow as an actor.The story itself is basic fairytale type, the lonely ogre Shrek only wants to be left alone in his self-imposed exile in his quiet swamp.  One day Lord Farquaad issues an edict offering a reward for the capture of all ""imperfect"" fairy tale creatures in his perfect land.  During the roundup, Donkey escapes and while running from soldiers is saved by Shrek.  After much haranging, Shrek allows him to stay at the swamp for the night and while eating dinner discover that Farquaad has dumped the ENTIRE population of fairy tale land in the swamp.  Determined to get his swamp back, Shrek heads off to see Farquaad and after an hysterical fight sequence, is made a deal:  Rescue Princess Fiona from the dragon, and get your swamp back. 
The adventures after that are exciting, funny, and sweet all at once. Princess Fiona is not even close to your average princess, and shows it in a sequence that is more ""Charlie's Angels"" (that starred Diaz) than it is ""Matrix"".  She also holds a deep dark secret of her own....will she tell anyone?The only complaint I have about this film is the CGI characters.  While the backgrounds and buildings were beautifully rendered, the characters themselves looked a bit plastic.  In this day and age, and especially after ""Toy Story"" and the upcoming ""Final Fantasy"", the fleshtones could have been a bit softer and realistic.   That's really the only complaint I have with this film however.""Shrek"" is a beautifully rendered and told fairytale.  There are jokes that kids will get, adults will get, and both will get (the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, and todays ""Animaniacs"" and ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" use the same formula), making it an easy sell for all audiences.  Dreamworks has themselves their first real shot at a franchise with this one. 
4 1/2 out of 5"
525,Shrek,,16 May 2001,Most agreeable!,"I have to admit that Shrek didn't make me laugh out loud, but that may be because of the terribly annoying woman sitting four rows behind me. She couldn't stop laughing at every single Disney pun in the movie... and since there is one of those every 5 minutes or so, imagine my dilemna. Besides that, Shrek was really loads of fun, and it was short and to the point. The film didn't really take itself too seriously and was peppered with subtle humor... well some times, it wasn't all that subtle. There are so many stabs at Disney that one hopes the guys at Dreamworks finally got it out of their system. The story is simple which is perfect because fairytales shouldn't require much from their audience. The characters and casting were great (the funniest character has to be The Donkey), and the animation was simply amazing. My only hope is that they don't produce a sequel... something so entertaining does not deserve to be ruined with a second attempt."
526,Shrek,10,2 June 2001,Pure Gold,"Thank God for Dreamworks -- once again, they've put together a movie with more on its mind than dollar signs. I would like very much to know who could possibly vote this movie a mere 1 -- other than the cursèd minions of Michael Eisner, who are no doubt sleeping uneasy these days as Shrek passes the $100 million mark.So what does Dreamworks have that Disney -- after so many years, and so many great films -- lacks ? Imagination. A willingness to take risks. Cleverness. An understanding of double meanings (""compensating for something,"" hmmm ?). But, really, it can all be boiled down to one thing -- one thing that isn't easy to find in Hollywood these days -- Inspiration. The indefinable, unreproducable 'it' that suggests that the movie was not some mass-produced machine-movie but something crafted. Something decent.By all means, don't miss Shrek. With so much drek coming out of Hollywood these days, we need to support the good stuff."
527,Shrek,8,2 June 2001,Goofy Fun,"""Shrek"" is a goofy movie.  In this case, of course, goofy is exactly what they were aiming for (as opposed to something like oh, say, ""Pearl Harbor"" where the goofiness is completely unintentional).  It's clever, it's entertaining, and there's always something interesting to look at on the screen.The voice-over work from Mike Myers, John Lithgow and most especially Eddie Murphy is fantastic - it seems that they really enjoyed their work on this movie.  Cameron Diaz does fine work, as well, though not as noticable since, like most fairy-tale princesses, she's not really given too much to do.It's an interesting story, because it both sticks like glue to fairy tale conventions, and turns the fairy tale genre on its ear; sort of like Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"", only more fun."
528,Shrek,9,2 June 2001,A Really Fractured Fairy Tale,"""Shrek"" has got to be the best animated movie so far!  I found it very cleverly written, and hilarious as well!  I enjoyed the spoofs of so many familiar fairy tales and nursery rhymes.  And the satire on the Disney Empire was also a hoot.  The computer animation is breathtaking.  The art form gets more and more state-of-the-art with each feature!  Mike Myers scores well as a Scottish-accented Shrek (although it's not hard to imagine the voice of Chris Farley, the original choice, coming out of the ogre). And Eddie Murphy truly steals the show as Donkey.  Despite some toilet humor, I'd say that ""Shrek"" is fun for the whole family!"
529,Shrek,10,2 June 2001,The Lean Green Laugh Machine,"We've all become critics of the critics. The modern man understands that a purely objective rating system makes it impossible to critique a film based upon multiple reviews. One reviewer may rave about a Bruckheimer film, while others pan it as a patriotic farce. Yet another may speak wonders of an indie flick, while the mainstream critics find it too obscure and outlandish. It's rare to find a film like Shrek - especially in the new millennium's ultra-diverse Hollywood: movies catering towards one demographic's tastes seldom find themselves accepted by another. Films that have the ability to transcend barriers are one-in-a-million...and Shrek seems to have done just that.Marketed as a ""fun-for-the-while-family"" flick, this isn't just another Disney bore that uses familiar B-actors with grating voices (see: any Olsen twins movie) just to keep the parents awake. It's not another political or metaphorical film, where the theme is targeted at an adult audience, and the kiddies are kept involved with a child-friendly plotline (see: South Park). No - Shrek is a truly unique film in that it is able to be both mature and childish at the same time (a Groucho Marx-esque trait) and, even more remarkably, succeeds at both ventures.Kids will love the crazy animations, the goofy songs, the funny fight scenes, and the fast pace. Adults chuckle heartily at the Disney-parody, the underlying theme of prejudice and reality, and Donkey's rants (as funny as those in Eddie Murphy's ""Delirious"" stand-up routine)... and at the funny fights scenes.To really appreciate this diversity, simply watch the people entering the theater: you'll see kids, parents and grandparents, and even teens, too.But to appreciate the film, watch the people as they leave: the smiling faces on all generations of people who appreciate the wonder and magic of this instant classic.See it today - and then again tomorrow."
530,Shrek,8,2 June 2001,Animated fairy tale offers modern touches.,"Although falling short of the majesty of ""Toy Story,"" Shrek"" does an admirable job in the animated family entertainment department.  A likeable ogre, a talking donkey and a host of other familiar fairy-tale characters populate the screen in a semi-charming story that serves up both humor and pathos.  Jabs at Disneyland and a very funny send-up of Robin Hood and his merry men are among the film highlights.  I especially liked Eddie Murphy (the donkey) and his rendition of the old Monkees' hit, ""I'm a Believer,"" (at movie's end).  If you wonder how many people it takes to make a film like Shrek, sit through the credits.  You'll go through four complete songs before the names stop rolling."
531,Shrek,8,2 June 2001,beautifully animated new classic fairy tale,"***Possible Spoilers**** The first thing I noticed while watching this movie was the exquisitely beautiful scenery behind the action.  I don't think my two kids noticed that part as much as I did; they were too busy laughing at the ogre's grooming habits.  At first I thought the ogre's voice was all wrong, too small with an on-again off-again hint of Scotland; but since I never met an ogre before and, consequently, never heard one speak, who am I to say that that's not right!  So I let the movie take me to the land of 3 blind mice and sleeping beauties....and I thoroughly and totally LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone no matter how old/young or how jaded/naive.  I want to go to the land of fairy tales too! How do I get there!P.S.  I especially loved the humorous references to Disney parks and animated films."
532,Shrek,,30 May 2001,"This movie tops ALL animated movies, both in content & visually!","I could never say enough about it!  I have recommended to everyone I know, both old and young, ""don't miss Shrek!""  I saw it with my 7-year old daughter, who asked quite a few times on some punch lines as I laughed uncontrollably, ""Mom, what does that mean?""The graphics are way better than any Disney animation out there.  I felt as if I was taken into the forrest with the characters.  All the personalities of the characters were so likeable, even Lord Farquaad.  The movie lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes, yet it kept our attention all thoughout.It's definitely as many thumbs up as the people who have and will see it, which could be millions!  I promise, this one isn't a waste your money."
533,Shrek,,30 May 2001,I don't get it,"I saw Shrek over the weekend and don't get all the rave reviews that I read before hand.  I saw a movie who could not make up its mind how it wanted to be funny.  First, the theater was generally filled with parents with children but all the trailers were for teenagers oriented move (must be a Dreamworks thing).  Second, the children around me did not get any of the jokes except the toilet humor, the talking donkey and the last scene of the movie.  Third, most teenagers are not going to get the Disney references, the references to many other movies, or the biting humor aimed at Michael Eisner.  Fourth, there were long stretches of the movie when no one laughed and most of the children fidgeted.  The movie tried to appeal to children, teenagers, and adults who all have very different senses of humor and thus ended up with a muddled movie.The bottom line:  Most people are saying this movie is great because they have been told that it is great.  If you showed it to a group who had not heard any of the buzz or scene any of the hype, they would say that it an above average animated movie that was was funny is a few places but not on anyone's top ten list."
534,Shrek,9,29 May 2001,My family liked it,"The best judge of the movie for me was the amount of laughs coming from my children.  And from me.  I laughed, my wife laughed, the kids laughed and we all had fun.  What more do you want?  This will be on the Christmas list for sure...."
535,Shrek,10,29 May 2001,Great movie,This movie was hilarious and entertaining.  I will definitely own it when it comes out on DVD.  Eddie Murphy did an outstanding job and the graphics amazed me.
536,Shrek,8,29 May 2001,"1/2 Great, 1/2 OK","The first half was fantastic!  We got to see all of our favorite fairy tale characters in glorious 3-D animation.  Very funny, and highly entertaining! The Gingerbread Man totally stole the show!And then there was the second half.  Eh, nothing to write home about.  It's basically your standard Disney-esque fairy tale love story (which I'm sure was the point... ).I wish they would have done more with Lord F.'s gathering of all the fairy tale creatures.  Overall, Shrek is pretty short and could have used more background story; nonetheless, it is a treat for the entire family."
537,Shrek,,28 May 2001,Fall-down funny,"DreamWorks Animation finally has an unalloyed success in the gut-bustingly funny ""Shrek"".After the mixed successes of ""The Prince of Egypt"", ""AntZ"", and the misbegotten ""Road to El Dorado"", ""Shrek"" gave me hope that maybe DreamWorks has hit its animated film stride.First-time directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jensen ensure that ""Shrek"" is stuffed full of jokes, puns and sight gags for both kids and adults, while maintaining a breezy pace.  If you liked the off-kilter humor of ""The Princess Bride"", then this is the movie for you.""Shrek"" takes place in the mythical kingdom of Duloc, ruled over by the evil, vertically-challenged Prince Farquaad (John Lithgow).  Farquaad wants to build ""the perfect kingdom"", but to do that he thinks he has to root out all of the fairy-tale creatures who inhabit his land.  Where do they go? Into the swamp, which just happens to be the home of a curmudgeonly ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers).  Joined by Donkey (Eddie Murphy), the poster boy--er, equine--for logorrhea, Shrek makes the journey to Farquaad's castle.  (This scene alone--Farquaad's castle bears an uncanny resemblance to a certain ""Happiest Place On Earth"", complete with turnstiles and ""You Are Parked Here"" signs--had me reduced to helpless guffaws.)  Shrek is sent on a quest to rescue damsel in distress Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and return with her so that she can marry Farquaad.  But Shrek doesn't count on falling in love himself.  Fiona, in turn, has her own secrets.""Shrek"" has a few things to say about inner versus outer beauty, and unlike the Disney fables ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"", actually has the courage to see it through to its logical conclusion.  But that's just one of the things I liked about it.  It also has a strong message of self-determination, as Fiona goes from behaving the way she thought women should behave (pliant, weak-willed and subservient) to learning that her life should be lived on her own terms.  I also loved an hysterically funny torture(!) scene involving Farquaad and the Gingerbread Man, as well as Shrek's reaction to the fairy-tale creatures invading his home (upon seeing Snow White in her glass-covered bier, he shouts, ""No, no! Dead girl off the table!"").  And a forest duet between Fiona and a bluebird cracked me up.  Even the de rigueur toilet humor elicited a chuckle or two.
Now, I do have some minor quibbles with the animation:   objects sometimes seemed to ""float"" above the background, especially objects moving away from the camera.  There also seemed to be a little disconnect between a person handling an object and the object itself.  However, these are minor complaints compared to the lush detail crammed into every frame, the beautiful colors that pop out at you, and the overall supple and fluid movement of every leaf on every tree.And so, to sum up this too-long review:  ""Shrek"" marks DreamWorks' coming of age as an animation studio, as well as being flat-out funny.  My grade: A-terry-"
538,Shrek,5,29 May 2001,"visually stunning, but a little gross","""Shrek"" is visually stunning. Dreamworks has really done a fantastic job with the computer animation. On the other hand I found some of the humor a little gross (is there no end to the flatulence jokes?!). I also have a hard time with many of the pop culture references. Although it may be humorous today, much of it will be meaningless in ten to fifteen years. I don't really see this film ""standing the test of time""."
539,Shrek,,29 May 2001,Something to notice,"In Farquaad's bedroom (midway through the pic), you see a bear skin rug on the floor with a bow on its head. At the end of the movie, Mama Bear is not with Papa and Baby Bear ... Anyone else missing from F's purge of the swamp?"
540,Shrek,9,12 May 2001,very good kids movie (spoilers),Shrek is your all around good kids movie.  Eddie Murphy is funny and Mike Myers gives a try hard performance.  This movie takes place in the land of fairy tales where the Ogar Shrek lives.  After being comfronted with the Donkey played by Eddie Murphy. He notices that all the fairy tales people have been droped off in the swamp.  Upset he travels to Farquars Palace which is played by John Lithgow.  After winnng a Fighting match Farquar Sends Shrek to save the Princess Feona.  Shrek excepts only if all the fairy tale people are sent away.  Farquar says yes and the Journey is on.  Feona is Played by Cameron Diaz and has the movies quite like the matrix.  See the movie and you might like it.  8/10 grade.
541,Shrek,9,30 May 2001,Outstanding family entertainment!!!,"It is not often that I or anyone comes across a film that is great entertainment for entire family.  ""Shrek"" is one of them.  This film takes all of the fairy tails that adults grew up with, puts them into the plot, and places an unlikely hero to be protect them.  This one uses the expected, child like humor that children love and places enough, adult humor that get the parents laughing.  At first I was worried about some of that, but then I noticed my 10 year old asking what the joke meant.  The writers did an excellent job of keeping the adult humor subtle enough to where the adults would understand it but the children won't.  This one has something for everyone in the family.The animation, is without a doubt, the best I have ever seen!  The realism of some of the characters is by far, superior to any other film.  The most notable, is Cameron Diaz's character, of Princess Fiona.  It is very plain to see, the animators used her expressions and mannerisms when drawing Fiona.  There is a very real, human touch to her, something I have not seen any animated film before.  This gives the film very warm touch.  The comic relief of Eddie Murphy's character of the Donkey brings laughs for everyone. This keeps everyone's attention.The story is based on fairy tales but altered to bring out some of the comedy and to show that you can't judge people by a first glance.  This is done well and the story as a whole is presented very well.  If you like a good story and are looking for something for the whole family, then ""Shrek"" is a must see movie for you and your family!  The only thing missing from the film is the courage and honor that should have been displayed by Mike Myers character, Shrek.  Shrek searches and finds the courage to face his own fear and self doubt, but the great challenge to make right what is wrong just does not seem to be there.  The climax just seems a bit too easy.  This is the reason I could not give this one a perfect 10, which only about 15 of the nearly 800 movies I have rated on this site have been awarded.""Shrek"" is a must see!!! (9 out of 10)"
542,Shrek,9,30 May 2001,A total cliche-breaker,"At the beginning of the film, what do we see?...a big thick colorful fairy tale book that opens and the first thing you see is one those big weird letters that no one these days use, then a cartoon-like narrator begins telling the story of the lovely beautiful enchanted princess waiting for her prince charming to save her from evil; and after that...what might you be thinking?!! Oh no, this wasn't supposed to be Disney!!!, right? well it is not!!!!, the corny little book sooner becomes into something we all use at the restroom, and suddenly, the cliche is broken.Now, don't get me wrong, just because the story doesn't follow the same path all the fairy tales we are used to do, it means that this film has no charm or marvelous fantasy by itself; it is flooded by it. And on the other hand, it was a blast, I couldn't stop laughing every single minute, I don't remember laughing that much a long time a go. The slight touch of dark humor made the film devilishly funny and on the opposite, some of the gags were so naively funny it was impossible not to smile at least. The characters were so well developed that you could sympathize with them all the time. 
I hope Shrek would become a classic in the following years, although these times that seems to be something hard to achieve, even though this film has everything, from adventure, romance, comedy, a great cast behind the voices, a good score and it was released in summer, when everybody has the chance to see it even if it is by chance. Go see it, laugh, smile and have a good time."
543,Shrek,8,30 May 2001,Shrek beats Disney's dreck,"Shrek was fun. Shrek was witty. Shrek created characters you cared about. Shrek had wonderful animation. Shrek was not made by Disney.Only two things disappointed me about Shrek:1. It's humor wasn't sharp enough. There were jokes, sure, and a good number of them were there for the adults in the audience. But Shrek never seemed to go far enough. For example, just seeing the Disney characters homeless was OK. It would have been better if the Disney characters would have been repetitive and shallow each time they popped up. THEN there would have been a joke.2. MINOR SPOILER FOLLOWS ... I was very disappointed that the princess became the, uh, creature she became at night. The movie's message was about looking beyond looks and beauty to see how wonderful the person was inside. And the plot started off very promisingly, with the characters doing just that. But the fact that the princess became an, uh, you know, at night was such a cop out. Why couldn't she have become a troll or a unicorn or something that was DIFFERENT. Once she became something that was the SAME, then the issue of looking at inner beauty was removed. I didn't agree with that twist at all.Still, loved Shrek, and hope to see more of him in a real, feature movie (not the cheap VHS knock-offs). We gave the movie an 8."
544,Shrek,10,27 May 2001,the first good movie of 2001,"I walked into this movie with hopes high as to CG animation quality but expectations low for the story. Other than the TOY STORY movies, the CG genre suffers from way too much emphasis on graphics and almost no thought to substance. Not with SHREK. By the end of this film I was completely engrossed, entertained and had fallen in love with all the characters especially Eddie Murphy's Donkey. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Mike Meyers deliver a (I'm not joking) subdued performance, if only vocally. The coup de grace: I saw this film with my four year old, my three year old and my wife and we all loved it. But not because it was for the ""kid in all of us"". We adults were definitely watching a different movie than our children. SHREK is a feat of layered storytelling. It can be appreciated not only by the young'ns for its storybook qualities and dazzling animation, but grown-ups too for its sophisticated commentary on how adults apply ridiculous fairy tale notions when seeking out love. I kid you not. This is the first good film of 2001 and the first worthwhile movie I've seen since that banner summer of 1999. By the way the subversive jabs at other childrens' movies (especially those made by a certain OTHER studio) is worth the price of admission alone."
545,Shrek,9,30 May 2001,Rolling on floor laughing.,"Sure, there's crude humor, and sure, it's debatable whether it's suitable for children, but it's funny. The very concept (brave, kind-hearted ogre saves beautiful princess from wicked, mean-spirited prince) is anti-stereotypical enough to be funny, and the picture probably doesn't miss a single opportunity for an in-joke."
546,Shrek,8,26 May 2001,Not really meant for the kids,"A really funny movie.  The voices were perfect for the characters. However I found the movie inappropriate for my kids at times.  My son even told me that we aren't supposed to say those words.  A lot of the humor is over the kids heads though.  I am even pretty sure there is one scene where the king was supposed to be ""handling himself in bed"" if you know what I mean.  I thought it was hilarious but felt funny laughing when surrounded by grade school age kids.Don't take the kids and be ready for a good laugh."
547,Shrek,10,30 May 2001,What a blast.,"""Shrek"" is by far the best family film to come out in a while, though I don't think this is really a family film. In fact, children will most likely not get most if not all of the references to past Disney movies, like ""Sleepy Beauty"" and ""Snow White"" to name a few.Another reason this isn't really a family film is the surprising amount of swearing for a 'PG' rated movie. This movie is however quite funny for those who are willing to go and see it. Mike Myers is excellent as Shrek and Eddie Murphy is superb as the hyperactive Donkey. It's a great film, that should please just about any movie fan. ***1/2 out of 4 stars."
548,Shrek,5,29 May 2001,How could anyone stand this garbage?,"I, unfortunately, saw Shrek this weekend. Any ""adult"" who says they liked this movie should have thier head examined. The kiddies will like the cartoon-quality characters and crude ""gross-out"" humor. That's all there is to this film.The humor could have kept me entertained, had the comedy not been severely lacking in both timing and delivery. I must admit, however, I found the interrogation scene very amusing.In short, see this movie if you think passing gas is genius-level comedy writing. See this movie if you like impressive computer rendering. See this movie if you would like to take a nap. See this movie if your age or your I.Q. is under 20. This is a kiddie movie and nothing more, I still can't figure out what material warranted a 'PG' rating."
549,Shrek,9,26 May 2001,Not your average fairy tale!,"A great mix of humour and silent comments. This film develops it's character very well.  It is entertaining as well unpredictable.  If you expect a 'once upon a time' and a 'happy ever after' type of story, well...you're not quite right.  The plot would fall under this category but the story and flow(pace) certainly breaks this stereotype. Who says all princesses must be pretty and who says all princes must be TALL, DARK and HANDSOME. A must watch for animation lovers. This 3-D animation will knock you off your feet. The dialogue and images are hilarious! Just sit back and enjoy...it's all worth it...A great family entertainment for the summer!"
550,Shrek,9,10 May 2001,An Instant Classic!,"Wonderful animation, hysterical script, great voices: it all adds up to SHREK being an instant classic, one that adults and children will love, but adults will want to see several times to get all the zingers that fly by!"
551,Shrek,9,26 May 2001,"Nice film, objectionable material greatly exaggerated","I feel it's important to rebut the many comments which have been made about the ""gross-out"" humor which people seem to have taken great exception to in Shrek. There is a bit more innuendo and tastelessness than some adults might care for.But consider the primary viewing audience of this film: kids (heck, the name is Shrek!) The innuendo will go--whoosh!---over their heads and the flatulence/b.o. jokes are definitely at grade school level. Young'uns minds are not being polluted by this harmlessness. I'm much more worried about the implications for society of 20-somethings being hung up on the same humor and flocking to see Carrey, Sandler, Schneider, and the gang in more ""sophisticatedly"" tasteless films.As for being a can of pop culture and thus hopelessly derivative and unoriginal, again, this movie is for kids. These touches to the film are witty, if self-consciously so, and the kids (and adults) in the theater I saw it in found it all very funny.I advise jaded viewers to try to view it with less pre-conceived bias against it.  So what if things are being rehashed? At least they're more genuinely conceived than pat Disney (Hercules et al.) I just rented Hamlet (Ethan Hawke, 2000) from Blockbuster and the ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy was delivered with Hamlet in the Action section of a Blockbuster store. I'm not saying Shrek was as high-concept, but both it and Shrek are demonstrations, on different levels, of how employing pop culture may add to a film.Mike Myers was all right, if a bit flat. Eddie Murphy was sometimes very funny. Cameron Diaz was a fine princess, after Steinem and Charlie's Angels. Some of the emotional touches in the animation were quite effective and put Toy Story 2 to shame. Not a perfect film, but adults, I beg you, watch this film through your kid's eyes (or, if you don't have one, fake it).Note: The author is 19, male, and lives on Long Island"
552,Shrek,10,26 May 2001,Humanity in the face of fear,"I found it hilarious that Donkey (Eddie Murphy) could so charm the Ogre and the Dragon. While the whole movie was great, two scenes that I both laugh at and find touching were when Donkey realized the Dragon was a girl Dragon, and then appealed to her (apparent) sense of vanity. (""You have such white sparkly teeth!!) And similarly, when meeting Shrek (the ogre), Donkey forgot to be scared because he was astonished by and felt compelled to respond to his bad breath (as only a friend would). Displaying humanity in the face of fear represents perhaps a more interesting message than the more obvious message many have commented on, ""don't judge a book by its cover"". These two scenes were two of many, many memorable moments."
553,Shrek,9,26 May 2001,A wonderful adventure!,"This is a great movie for anyone. It's a story of adventure, danger, love, hate, evil, good, heroes, cowards, ogres and donkeys. All the things that make a fairy tale great! From beginning to end Shrek is packed with great storytelling, humor and beautiful visuals. The voice casting for the characters is absolutely perfect. John Lithgow makes a fantastic villain to Mike Myers' reluctant hero Shrek, Eddie Murphy is predictably hilarious and Cameron Diaz does a superb job giving voice to Princess Fiona. So perfect are the characters and story that within minutes of the movie beginning you will forget that the movie is animated. From the way they walk to their facial expressions, the characters are human (or ogre or talking donkey or gingerbread man).Moms, dads, aunts, uncles, grandmas, grandpas, godfathers, legal guardians, foster parents... take the kids to see this one! This movie will make them laugh. Even better, this movie will make YOU laugh. In fact, you have to be a grownup to catch all the jokes. Keep an eye out for spoofs of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon plus cameo appearances by basically every fairy tale character ever created.If you like a well-told story, great laughs and lots of plot subtleties then don't miss this one. It just won't be the same on your little TV screen if you wait for the home video.In my opinion this movie is very close to perfect. 9/10.Go see this one even if you don't have kids! I personally went to see this movie with two other adults and we all had a fantastic time!"
554,Shrek,10,29 May 2001,Very Original Movie!!!,"This movie was great!!!  It is about an ogre who gets sent on a mission to find a princess locked in a tower.  It has characters from almost every fairy tale imaginable, and then some completely new ones.  My favorite character is the donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy).  It has a predictable ending, just like every fairy tale, but it is so funny, and so worth the money!!!  I mean you have to expect something kind of crazily funny with Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, but this movie was so beyond my expectations. You can not miss this movie if you like to laugh!!!!  I don't think I have ever laughed this hard!!!"
555,Shrek,,26 May 2001,Life comes to computer animation,"Finally the promises of computer animation begin to be fulfilled. While some of the background characters are a bit stilted and fluidity of motion is limited, the main characters reach a lifelike realism that often evades real actors.The dialog is tight and the action non-stop. Twists and turns in the plot take you through a well told story never letting you down. Even the occasional predictable turn carries a new angle.True, there are cliches, but they fall into place with the satisfaction of a favorite snack. at every turn the plot turns to laugh at itself, or poke fun an someone new."
556,Shrek,,26 May 2001,Not fantastic by any means,"Entering the theater, I suppose my aspirations weren't too high.  In the first five or ten minutes I was however pleasantly surprised by such an interesting, and unamiable protagonist.  While the movie perhaps would have been more interesting, or witty, or clever, or funny had the characterization continued along these lines, within the first quarter of the movie it was revealed that he was really a likeable scamp.  From this point, the movie is robbed of its ingenuity, and has become like the Disney movies that it attempts to be critical of.  One of the things about this movie that bothered me the most, however, is an obvious continuity error. Towards the end of the movie, when everyone is rejoicing, the three blind mice are turned into a carriage.  Within two minutes, the same mice are seen to be frolicking on a piano.  This might have been forgiveable had the span in the error been longer, but it was two minutes!  Also, I had problems with the soundtrack, which tended to blast the most obnoxious music very loudly. Furthermore, the scene in which the ""heros"" encounter Robin Hood, I consider to be an obvious rip-off of Mel Brooks'""Robin Hood Men In Tights"", as far as the singing and dancing is concerned.  All in all, this movie should have been much better than it was, and it was truely disappointing, especially considering the rave reviews surrounding it."
557,Shrek,8,29 May 2001,Reuse and Recycle is not a motto for film,"While I enjoyed Shrek, and was definitely laughing out loud in several spots, there were several annoying details that marred my experience. One ""ass"" joke was sufficient, and the second one felt forced. And in almost every scene the director/writer felt the need to reuse pieces of other movies. It was cute to a point, especially where the reference was modified to enhance its humor (the princess singing with the bird was excellent). But reusing Beauty and the Beast at the end and the Matrix for the fighting scene was unnecessary. Plus the ""D'ye think he's compensating for something"" jokes (also used twice) confused my 10 year old, and were not needed in a movie targeted for the whole family. BTW, the skewering of DisneyWorld was brilliant, but I think Katzenberg took his grudge a little too far, attempting to make fun of every animated Disney feature in under 100 minutes. Overall, it was a good movie, and I think the sweet spot of the target audience is at about 15. The graphics are gorgeous, the pacing is fast, and the humor is non stop."
558,Shrek,8,28 May 2001,One of the better animation efforts in a long time...,"Great animation, clever plot, genuinely funny gags, and an all round enjoyable film.  Double meanings keep the adults chuckling while kids can thoroughly enjoy this movie as well.  Highly recommend it for kids 7 and older."
559,Shrek,9,28 May 2001,An amazing accomplishment,"It would be refreshing to occasionally watch an ""Eddie Murphy"" movie that doesn't resort to bathroom humor and fart jokes to get laughs but, having said that, Shrek is a ""must see"" for grown ups and older children. Hint to parents: Leave children under 7 at home. The creators of the film did an amazing job with the computer-generated animation with incredible detail and accuracy. Viewers probably will want to see it several times to catch everything."
560,Shrek,10,10 May 2001,The funniest movie of all time...,"I doubt if many people will think this is the absolute funniest movie they have ever seen. However, it may be the funniest movie ever on universal appeal.  Little kids were laughing.  Grey haired ladies were laughing.  Some big biker dude was laughing.  My wife was doubled over in tears.  We missed many lines in the movie because the whole theater was roaring.No, this is not a thick plot.  The characters will not endure tremendous growth or tragedy.  But that's not what they were trying to do here.  They were making a silly, roller coaster, laugh your butt off kind of movie.  And they did that very well.  Murphy and Myers were VERY funny without being lewd.  I commend them for that.For a bunch of good laughs for every one in the family (including your hard to please teenager) Shrek is a must see.  There were things happening in the movie that were so absurd and wacky that everyone had no choice but to laugh.  Go.  See.  Enjoy."
561,Shrek,9,24 May 2001,Best 3D animation to date,"The depth of stylish realism in not only the characters, but also the sets, props, and most notably the outdoors make this film the most visually amazing 3D animated feature I've ever seen.  The characters animations are amazingly believable in most cases, yet in many cases a silly puppet/marionette style is picked up, which works great considering that many of the characters/creatures are supposed to be fairy tale types anyways.  My only complaint is that Princess Fiona seemed a bit shallow as a character, though this too seems like it could have been intentional given her character development that takes place.  I think her final appearance was a much warmer, realistic, & more believable character than her original appearance."
562,Shrek,9,28 May 2001,wonderful fractured fairy tale,"This is a terrific movie. It's sweet, very funny, and has a lyrically satiric edge. I think that it will become a classic. The cast is excellent (especially Eddie Murphy in the role of the talking donkey), and the animation is state of the art (although that will change in a few minutes). The movie is great fun both for kids (my 6 and 10 year old daughters loved the movie) and for adults (my dad and both liked it very much, too). I don't believe that it's necessary to recap the plot, but it gives the movie lots of chances to have fun with fairy tales, and they do. There are so many hilarious moments that some of them are things that happen in the background without any notice by the main characters."
563,Shrek,,28 May 2001,Great Satire & a Good Message,"""Once upon a time"" goes down the drain -- literally.All the classic cartoon fairy-tale characters are cast out of fairy-tale land by a nasty little dictator with Freudian problems. It is up to the least-likely of heros to save the day -- actually four least-likely heros.We have self-righteous villagers with torches, an ogre ban on singing, plus types and stereotypes all over the place. All the cliches get squashed till the juices splatter everywhere -- and it's great fun.The idea that appearances are deceiving is well illustrated without being preachy. We all wear illusions and masks. Maybe if we were simply who we really are, the world would be nicer. Maybe not, but who knows?While I am not as impressed with computer graphics as many people seem to be, this is still a funny film that everyone can enjoy."
564,Shrek,8,28 May 2001,Everybody loves it!,"Small wonder that this movie will be a big $$ maker for Dreamworks.  It appeals to almost every viewer on some level.  What I liked was the animation...the beautiful use of color, the subtle textures and attention to the smallest details.   Eddie Murphy was perfect as Donkey.   What I didn't like was all the fart references and gross-out humor.  Hopefully, this fad shall pass from the movie industry's requisite for comedy.  I gave this film an 8 and have already recommended my boss and his family to go see it, so it had BETTER be good!"
565,Shrek,8,25 May 2001,One of the better movies I have seen this year!,"Very funny and entertaining movie!  No need to repeat what has been written by the majority of the users.  The good comments are for real.  Oh, I'm 30, my wife's 34.... we both found it equally entertaining!My only complaint is with some of the users on this message board.  Not the majority of them, just the few that believe that their children's mind is going to be taken over by Satan himself because a computer generated ogre farts in the water and gets his dinner or he uses his ear wax as a candle. I mean, come on people!  First off, if you feel that passing gas is such a vulgar and disgusting thing... one that you can't make a joke about...I can understand how you are afraid to leave your house or fear for your children's life.  This movie isn't rated ""G"" is it?  I think it was rated ""PG"".  With that comes some adult humor.  And instead of criticizing a movie because it makes fun of everyday situations that the rest of us ""sinners"" find amusing, use your brain, read this message board and see why a movie is rated ""PG"" before you start complaining about it!!!  I hate it when someone is warned....like the wonderful job that imdb.com does with explaining the reason a movie gets a rating.... that a movie has some crude humor....then that person feels like that have to complain for the very same reason they were warned!  Makes no sense to me.  But hey, that's just my 2 cents!ANYWAY... Did it have some crude humor in it?  Yes.Was it funny?  Yes.  Were we warned it had crude humor in it from IMDB?  YES!Were we ever told that it was supposed to be a close nit family movie? NO!Was the movie rated ""G""?  NO.Just because it has a ""cartoony"" look to it, doesn't mean it was made for 5 year old kids!"
566,Shrek,8,27 May 2001,See it more than once!,"In my opinion, this movie is so full of things to see, I think seeing it a second time is worth the money.  The humor delivered in this movie seems to be equally funny to seven-year-olds and forty-seven-year-olds.  It cracks the ol' funny-bone particularly hard, but has as story soft enough to tug at some heart-strings at the same time.See it with your kids!  See it with your parents!  See it with your whole family!  See it by yourself!The humor is witty and fun.  And just when you think you know what will happen next, the surprises start you laughing all over again."
567,Shrek,10,27 May 2001,A perfect film,"I just got home from seeing it and I'm still flying!  Oh, man, I have not laughed so hard at a flick in months.  SHREK is one of those flicks where, upon later examination, you can identify the pop culture references used to generate the humor.  Do NOT try to do this while watching the film the first time.  Besides, the film won't let you!  Just when you think you're onto the creators' jokes, they throw a whole new angle at you, pulling in material from an unexpected source and sending you into asthma-inducing gales of laughter.One thing, SHREK does strike me as a spiritual kin of Austin Powers, with the broad comedy masking a surprisingly touching core story about the search for love. One last thing--  as you watched the film, you noticed (and soon last count of) all the fairy tale and medieval myth references.  One that may have escaped you--  Farquar has Prince Valiant's head....."
568,Shrek,9,27 May 2001,I laughed my butt off.,"This movie was almost perfect. It had John Lithgow as a hilarious villain, the comic vocal voice stylings of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, brilliant animation, tons of pointed jabs at bloated corporate giants, mounds of amusing plots twists and, well, it just kind of made me happy. I will remember until my dying day the interrogation of the gingerbread man and Mike Myers just seems to get better with each movie.This movie had one flaw: predictable plot. Ordinarily, this would reduce the movie to at best an eight, but since this was a fairy tale, it only seems fair to give a nine."
569,Shrek,10,27 May 2001,"Highly Entertaining, also intelligent","It was the opening weekend of Pearl Harbor, but I opted to see ""Shrek"" and from what I've heard, I think I made the much wiser choice.""Shrek"" is, along with the ""Toy Story"" movies, the ONLY worthwhile animated feature made in the last 10 years or so.  It's entertaining for all ages yet at the same time doesn't insult your intelligence if you are an adult. There are a number of little hidden jokes that one would probably catch on repeated viewings, if not the first time.One such hidden joke is the mild slam of Disney.  In case you don't know, Dreamworks is the currently Disney's closest rival in the animated feature market.  Notice Farquaad's grounds to his castle, and it is almost a mocking parody of Disney World.Eddie Murphy as the donkey is spectacular, but I wouldn't say that he steals the show as I thought he would.  The characters of Myers, Diaz, and Lithgow are all sensational.Though I would normally be slamming a movie such as this for it's use of pop songs, they were actually used with some intelligence in this film. Overall, a perfect 10, and one I look forward to seeing again and again."
570,Shrek,10,10 May 2001,A true gem,"After months of bland and downright awful movies, Hollywood finally gets one right with ""Shrek"", the new animated fractured fairy tale from the folks at Dreamworks Pictures and PDI, who last collaborated on the 1998 hit ""Antz"".
The movie is about an ogre named Shrek, a creature who greatly values his privacy. When an arrogant little prince by the name of Lord Farquaad banishes the fairy tale inhabitants of his kingdom to Shrek's private swamp, the ogre goes to protest. Farquaad promises to remove the inhabitants if Shrek rescues the lovely Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded castle so Farquaad can marry her and become King. With a talking donkey as his sidekick, Shrek heads off on the adventure of his lifetime.
Take that fairy-tale premise, sprinkle it with great voice talent (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow), a smart and often hilarious screenplay (co-written by two of the people who wrote 'Aladdin'), solid directing from Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson and some of the best computer animation put on screen yet, and you have a comedy that will delight all ages. A must see."
571,Shrek,9,27 May 2001,Believe the hype! This movie rocks!,"OK, I have to admit I've always had problems with Dreamworks' movies... I hate Spielberg's Disney/sugar-coated touch and how it effects many of the movies released by them.. However, Katzenberg and Dreamworks' animated films are another story. Chicken Run and now Shrek were both great films that work so well not because they copy the Disney cliches (like that dumb Mosses movie) but because they break free from them.  Biting humor, a great msg. that doesn't sell out (notice in Beauty and the Beast how the happy ending revolved around the Beast becoming a handsome prince and not us accepting him for who he is- ""Don't judge the book by it's cover because underneath the ugly beast is Matt Damon..."").. ANYWAYS, Enjoy this movie NOW on the big screen and not on video months from now- some of the Joke's may simply not be funny anymore.  The Matrix spoofs and river dancing bit have been done and will continue to be done making the film seem tired and ""old."" This is not a criticism just a fact about today's film climate- comedy right now revolves around in-jokes, pop-culture references, and fart jokes.. The writers of Shrek know this and do an excellent job.. Witty as the writing was, Eddie Murphy simply has out-done himself yet again.. I've never seen an animated film that felt so improvised.. Murphy should be respected and seen as a A-list performer. While Myer's and Diaz may get all the press, the true talent here is Murphy.Lastly, people that think this film is crude or ""immoral:""  Please, lighten the heck up. This film has a great msg. that I think kids should hear... Kids live on a diet of poop and fart jokes- don't try to shelter them from a rewarding and near brilliant film.. This movie aside, ""protecting"" your child from the outside world to the degree that some of you people seem to go to (""previewing"" a cartoon before bringing your kid to watch it??) should be considered CHILD ABUSE.. I have a larger argument based on personal experience but you people are doing horrible damage to your kids by not letting them be young and silly.. This isn't Freddy Got Fingered and nothing in this movie is ""ruder"" than what's on television.. I personally have not read the bible passage that you all seem to live by ""Thou Shall not Let Your Children Watch a Witty and Wildly Creative Film  Because of the Butt Jokes"".. is that in Luke?  I think I missed that one.."
572,Shrek,10,27 May 2001,Face-ache Laughter Abounds!,"I knew this movie would be interesting because of the computer-generatedimagery (CGI), and I figured it would be funny with Eddie Murphy in it,but I had NO IDEA I would have as much fun as I did watching it!  Myface started aching from large smiles and laughter about 20-30 minutesinto the film and never stopped.  There were a lot of paradies of knownsci-fi and fantasy blockbusters, some subtle, some not.  There were alsogeneric funnies for both children and adults.I should also mention that one of the friends with whom I went to see itlooks for the details of CGI and was very impressed with the CGI in thisfilm.  As an example, he noted that as the characters walked, the grassunder their feet would be flat and gradually wave back into the uprightposition, just like in real life.  I didn't notice this, but that'sprobably because it was so well done!  Isn't it true with most specialeffects that you only notice them if they're bad?I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
573,Shrek,,25 May 2001,Most witty and clever animation so far!,"GO SEE SHREK!!  The movie is pure genius.  If you're not laughing out loud, you have a big smile across your face.  True, some of the jokes are more adult oriented and gross and crass, but for anyone who has spent anytime an elementary school playground will know that kids today are surprisingly rude and vulgar.  It always amazes me how some parents try to shelter there kids from offensive materials.  Don't get me wrong, the majority of reviews for Shrek have been positive. However, I would like to comment on certain people who believes it lowers social standards or that the disgusting jokes are unnecessary.  My advice, stop being so old and be a kid again.  I do research in an elementary school and I've encountered kids who can make a sailor blush with their copious knowledge of explicative words! Besides, those who feel that they should shield their kids of a brilliant movie like this would probably be the parents who'd be shocked that their kids are the drug dealers and pimps.Anyway, got a little off track.  Shrek is a great film that pokes fun at Disney, fairy tales in general, and should appeal to the kids in all of us (well except those who are intent on staying old and grumpy)."
574,Shrek,10,25 May 2001,The best movie I have seen on so many different levels.,"My wife and I took our 11 and 6 years olds to Shrek expecting to see another typical family oriented animation. We were pleasantly surprised by the depth, humor, incredible animation and writing that pleased and enchanted the adults and children. We will definitely buy this one when it's out on video."
575,Shrek,,25 May 2001,Just to throw a bit of a political spin on it,"Shrek is probably about as close as we are going to get to a satire of the Mickey Mouse empire without the Disney legal strike team shutting down the movie.  In fact, if this film was produced on a smaller budget by an independent we probably wouldn't be watching it.  Shrek strikes an incredible good balance between lowbrow and highbrow humor combining them in ways that are entertaining while still satarizing the over-sweet faery-tale movie cannon that we grew up with.  Disney may throw in a few anacrhonistic winks and nods into its animated films (setting a Big Boy in the Andes).  Shrek actively subverts the entire genre with twisted references to just about every Disney animated film made, and Disneyland its self.  While this is a very good film, it certainly had some down-points.  The primary character and scenic animation is beautiful but the minor characters look and move like ""Thunderbirds are Go.""  In many scenes the minor characters just don't move like human beings.  Since most of the best humor in the film is grounded in the visual (and textual) references to other films, I don't expect Shrek to be a classic.  Mike Myers slipping in and out of a pesudo-scots accent was slightly irritating.  However, these are minor quibbles.  This is one of the few films I'll probably see twice in the theatres."
576,Shrek,8,25 May 2001,Just a few clarifications,"Just to clarify a few things I read in other readers' comments--The princess-kicking-butt scene was actually a spoof of ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000), which of course, was spoofing (errr... ripping off) ""The Matrix."" (Diaz did the same scene in Angels).And it was Eddie Murphy as Donkey, not Will Smith (sshEEsh.)"
577,Shrek,9,24 May 2001,An all around pleasant and cheery movie.,"Initially the audience of toddlers that surrounded me in the theater gave me a little skepticism about my judgement in going to this movie, but I got to say, I'm happy I did.  The movie was really great.  The story was simple yet imaginative.  The computer graphics where astonishing and truly dazzled the eye.  And the actors voice work was highly amusing and added a great feel to the whole package.  My only complaint to the movie was the use of Smashmouth's music in the opening and closing sequences of the film.  That's a personal thing though, I can't stand the band and their music really didn't feel appreciate to the feel I was getting or wanted from the film.  I definitely encourage everyone out there to see this movie on the big screen though, the graphics, while cartoony, are absolutely stunning and it be a shame to miss them on the big screen."
578,Shrek,7,25 May 2001,"Funny, but un-necessarily vulgar","This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, flat out.  I do mean that, my wife and I have no children, but went to see it because it looked good and we like movies of this sort (A Bug's Life, Toy Stories 1 & 2, etc). I thought Mike Myers was great, Eddie Murphy greater and Cameron Diaz funny as all get out.  The sight gags, puns, in-jokes, and slight jabs at Disney were almost perfect.But did we really need to see a Donkey urinating on a fire to put it out? Or Shrek catching his dinner by passing gas in the water?  Or the incessant 'Ass' jokes?  I know kids find that kind of thing funny, along with the gross out stuff like eyeballs in the martini and the earwax candle; but come on, couldn't we come up with something a little less low-rent?  It's easy to come up with toilet humor, try coming up with something just as funny (like Pinnochio lying about being a real boy to save himself) that's not disgusting.I would have given this movie a 10 if they hadn't actually shown Donkey peeing on the fire.  As it sits, a solid 7"
579,Shrek,10,24 May 2001,"You will laugh! Excellent, humorous, sophisticated, entertaining...","_Shrek_ is an entertaining film that is simply funny, but also satirical and often sarcastic. Kids CAN enjoy it, though be warned that it does have those tell-tale bits of toilet humor that always seem to sneak into films starring Mike Myers or Eddie Murphy. Of course, the film takes shots at Disney, as well as heroic fantasy and mythic tales. It's very funny, and does have something for everyone.The plot is fairly predictable, though it does have a few surprises, and it does leave a couple mysteries unanswered at the end of the movie.The animation is fantastic, but of course it does have a distinctive ""digitized"" style that feels like watching a PlayStation 2 game for 90 minutes. Really a wonderful achievement, but it may not be something everyone appreciates.The use of music was one of my favorite parts of the film: from Eddie Murphy's (as the Donkey) intentionally horrible, toneless renditions of a couple soul classics early in the film, to some well-placed sentimental, pop tunes later in the film, the music really goes a long way towards making the film more enjoyable and humorousFinal verdict: A fun, funny film that can entertain adults and children and which puts an affirming twist on the ""ugly duckling"" tale. See it yourself for the humor; take the kids to see it for the fun and the positive ""moral"" at the end of the story."
580,Shrek,9,9 May 2001,Instant classic,"Shrek is a beautifully told, hilariously funny fairy tale.The voices are wonderful, the look of the film is astonishing and the script is beyond brilliant.The use of modern pop songs adds something very unique to the tale, hopefully a soundtrack that includes Smashmouth and The Proclaimers will have resonance with viewers for years to come.Ya gotta love this movie. Even if one of the characters looks like Oprah (see the movie to guess which one)."
581,Shrek,9,17 March 2005,Shrek,"If you liked Toy Story as a computer animated film, you'll like this. A fairytale never told about an ogre called Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers). He has lived in his swamp for a long time. Then one day he stumbles on Donkey (loud-mouthed Eddie Murphy). They do not get on that well together at first but they become better friends as the film goes on. When Shrek's swamp becomes crowded with fairytale people and creatures Shrek goes to Lord Farquaad's castle. Farquaad (John Lithgow) is the one who made them go there. But the Lord is too busy trying to become King, to do this he decides to make a deal with Shrek to let him have his swamp back if he rescues Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a lava surrounded, dragon guarded castle. After he had done this he Shrek had started to have a special relationship with the Princess, until eventually they had fallen in love. A charming story with some good comedy moments. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. It was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and along with the sequel, both were number 6 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"
582,Shrek,1,5 November 2001,pure tripe,"a couple of funny gags can't save this pile of thirteen-year-old-minded mush. Multiple fart jokes from the get go signalled a long 90 minutes for this viewer. The film was completely disjointed, with no cohesion of story, structure, character or pace. Each scene seemed to have been created by a different crew, with the total suddenly mashed together at the end. Why this film has been so successful is beyond me. If you want CGI supported by a SCRIPT, watch Toy Story 1 & 2. This was a 90-minute sitcom (a badly written one at that), with some big name voices all going through the motions as ""characters"" that were nothing but unimaginative derivations of their public personas."
583,Shrek,1,6 April 2016,I can't forgive this movie for making me suffer,"Back when I was in high school, when this movie came out and somehow became popular, my teachers in three separate classes coincidentally all decided that letting the class watch Shrek for a day, instead of doing anything involving learning or teaching, would be a fine way to pass the time. Consequently, I had to suffer through this movie three times. At least the third time was in my web-design class, so I at least got sit an a computer browsing the Internet while the movie was playing. No, I'm not kidding. This is how your education tax dollars were being spent. Only in America. Anyway, I hated the movie all three times. It's a bunch of ugly, poorly animated cartoon characters acting rude and crude. If you find this kind of thing funny, good for you, but such lame-brained humor is just obnoxious to me. Shrek got hit in the nuts while sliding down a slide! Am I supposed to laugh? An ugly cartoon character is saying inappropriate things in Eddie Murphy's voice! This is supposed to be funny, right? Other people seem to love it, but I was just annoyed."
584,Shrek,1,8 June 2001,A movie for americans,"First I gonna say somethings I didn't know before going to the theatre: The movie is a parody of Disney Movies (so don't expect very much from the because it isn't the major objetive here) and it's a totally computer generated movie (that's a thing you don't see everyday). Secondly, you won't give this movie an 8 unless you are an american or a ""monkey of americans"" (try to be like an american), because you'll need to know a lot of american culture (all american fairtales, have been on disneyland and know american culture generally). This movie is better than average movies, has nice computer graphics and some funny stuff, but is at most an 7. Oh, if you want to see this movie watch it in the theatres or you won't enjoy the computer graphics at all and it'll be only a little funny movie."
585,Shrek,,19 August 2004,SPOILER -- Vastly overrated movie series,"Shrek and its sequel are bland, trite, uncreative, wannabe-witty, and boring, but, inexplicably, both critics and audiences adore them. I've seen good movies, and Shrek is just not a good movie. Shrek is the Craig Kilborn of movies: it's smug and self-satisfied in its so-called irreverent attitude, while it faithfully repeats all the clichés it purports to lampoon. **SPOILER AHEAD**How many viewers under the age of 4 didn't see the ending of Shrek (or Shrek 2) lumbering up Fifth Avenue? What a surprise! The princess chooses to be ugly! How incredibly irreverent in the most mind-numbingly politically correct way! What's the moral here? Be yourself? What attitude! What originality! Hamlet, step aside. **NOW LEAVING SPOILER ZONE**Hey, I know! Let's make a movie starring a kind-hearted but misunderstood hero with a witty, flippant sidekick! Never been done before. Oh wait, it has, but that's OK, because we're satirizing Disney! Let's fill it full of jokes that the parents will get but the kids won't! What a concept! Have we forgotten so soon what true attitude in kids' movies can be like? Can Shrek hold a candle to anything created by Jim Henson? I guess in the 21st century, jokes about bodily functions count as wit and attitude.Shrek is product, plain and simple. Take big-name actors, throw in some snipes at Disney, throw in some crude jokes. But we have to make sure the movie succeeds: follow the standard cartoon movie story. Oh, we also have to make sure we don't offend anyone: Give it four or five passes through the political correctness machine. I have to say that Eddie Murphy as the sidekick is funny. Restrained and subdued in a strange way, like the rest of the movie, but still funny. And Mike Myers does a decent job with the Scottish accent. I've seen many worse movies than Shrek; it's just that the obsequious fawning that everyone does is finally starting to get to me (can you tell?) I just got back from lunch at the food court and the Bourbon Chicken place has a sign above it that reads: ""It's not spicy! You'll love it!""I guess Shrek is also the Bourbon Chicken of movies."
586,Shrek,5,19 May 2001,Just bad,"There's a good laugh about every ten minutes...too bad that only equals about 8 in the entire film. This film was four years in the making, and they should have scrapped it long, long ago. In a few months, it will be little but an embarassing memory when faced up to Final Fantasy. The animation is bad, and the voice acting is even worse. Mike Meyers' faux Scottish accent is annoying. I have one more suggestion: why only three Smashmouth songs? Why not an entire album? 5/10"
587,Shrek,1,17 June 2001,Well done but boring.,Of course the animation was good. It was also well written(kinda). I just dont think it deserves the high marks it is getting. Personaly i think Toy Story was better. Toy Story was fun visualy and its humor was better. i suspect many of the critics are ugly(you will know what i mean after you see it).
588,Shrek,1,15 June 2001,One of the best of the year.,"Watch out Disney, SHREK is taking over your territory and you are quickly sinking into bland silly musicals. This film is clever and smart and has a wonderful message that is not obvious. It's fun and irreverant and anything BUT 'politically correct', and I loved every cotton pickin minute of it, so did my whole family. We saw it twice in the last few weeks, so relieved to see something that is not pretentious but fun and smart. Go and see this film, you won't regret it!!          .."
589,Shrek,10,3 November 2014,Shrek Is extra Large and more lovable than anything conceived because he is Shrek.,"10/10 BEST MOVIE!!!! Shrek is wonderful ogre. He is super sexy and makes me happy when I see him. But when I see Farquadd on screen I smash the TV so I never finished the movie, but I know its great because Shrek Is Love Shrek Is Life. In fact smashing the TV reminds me of this movies amazing soundtrack made by Smash Mouth. Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an ""L"" on her foreheadWell, the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumbSo much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

How about yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas I need to get myself away from this place I said yep, what a concept I could use a little fuel myself And we could all use a little changeWell, the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumbSo much to do so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow.And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold."
590,Shrek,10,14 April 2014,"A funny, feel-good start to Dreamworks' best film franchise","The first time I'd ever heard of this film was on a bus advertisement when I was 14 and I misread the title as 'Shreik' but upon close inspection, it actually said 'Shrek' and it appealed to me due to its well-known voice cast (Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy). I saw this at the cinema with my volunteer/social worker and we both enjoyed it. The part where Princess Fiona kicked Robin Hood and his Merry Men out of the way was the one that made me laugh the most during my first viewing. The animation style is realistic for a Dreamworks film, particularly the human character designs and the backgrounds. The dialogue is funny and memorable if heartbreaking in places (particularly Fiona revealing to Donkey that she turns into an ogre at sunset) and while the film may not contain original side-characters due to them already existing in other stories, the story is original for a fairytale-themed film due to Shrek rescuing Fiona instead of a prince. While the most memorable piece of incidental music is the one being played while Fiona sings to a bird and makes it explode (it sounds like the Dreamworks logo music), the soundtrack consisting of rock and pop songs was more memorable. My favourite songs on the soundtrack were the opening song 'All Star' by Smash Mouth, Donkey's brief sing-song of Willie Nelson's 'On The Road Again,' the piña colada song played when Lord Farquaad chooses Fiona in the style of a 'Blind Date' spoof, John Cale's version of 'Hallelujah (I mistakenly thought this was Rufus Wainwright's version), Joan Jett's 'Bad Reputation,' the amusing ditty sung by the Duloc puppets, 'I'm On My Way' by the Proclaimers and Smash Mouth's version of 'I'm A Believer' at the end. Shrek is selfish yet endearing and Myers gives him a pretty decent Scottish accent, Murphy is hyper yet comical as Donkey, Diaz is recognisable and heartfelt as Fiona and Lithgow, while not the most well-known of the main cast, is menacing as Farquaad.Overall this is a hilarious, feel-good start to my favourite Dreamworks animated film franchise and is my second favourite in the 'Shrek' quadrilogy with the second one being the best. 10/10."
591,Shrek,,7 September 2011,Quick Impression,"I couldn't watch more than about five minutes of this drivel because it starts with clichéd scatological humor. Ho, ho, how funny is that? Might as well have started with a pie in someone's face. I would not have mourned if scatological humor died with the misanthropic Jonathan Swift. Grow up people, for God's sake. Granted, Dave Barry insists that the essence of comedy lies in the word ""bugger."" But he's a special case: A man with a God-given sense of humor who doesn't believe in God. I wish I had dollar for every ""hilarious"" scene of someone leaving a bathroom with toilet paper stuck to their shoes. It just doesn't get any funnier than that does it? Well, if you know your movie history, it certainly does: think of the work of Harold Loyd, Blake Edwards, Woody Allen, Buster Keaton, and countless others."
592,Shrek,8,29 November 2010,"Once upon a time, when Dreamworks actually cared about the film itself...","A grumpy Ogre and a talking donkey must venture to save a Princess and bring her back to a despicable Lord in order for the Ogre to reclaim his confiscated swamp...The original Shrek is better than most adults think, it has some very clever jokes that are aimed more at the people taking the kids to the cinema in the first place, it is also a reminder that Eddie Murphy was actually a funny guy a while back. Shrek cleverly toes the line between pleasing the kids and rewarding Mum and Dad for their patience.I'm on the fence about labeling it ""great"" though... There are a few moments that will have you reaching for the FF 30 seconds button, and a few jokes that will ""swooooosh"" right over your kid's head while you chuckle a little.This reputation is sullied by the rancid taste of sequels two and (especially) three, both blatant cash grabs that were more interested in pop culture references and shoehorning in rips from famous films and nudge-nudge nods to adults that were far more effective and classy in the original. I loathe everything about the Third film, which in desperation introduces the old reliable staple of babies, when all else fails...And now later this year we'll have a 4th. My Spidey-sense is already tingling...What you hope kids will learn: It's what's inside that counts.What they'll take away: Farts and burps are funny. (Well they are.)If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
593,Shrek,8,22 December 2009,Great Film Overall And Throughout.,"Being over 8 years old and still being watched in great numbers still, Shrek is a typical true love beauty and the beast plot, with the cast featuring a duo-ship of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy you know it going to involve adult/child humour for example, When standing outside Duloc Shrek make a comment on the castle and Lord Farquard size along with his 'dignity'. Being one of the greatest animations created this decade and quickly becoming a saga this is truly showing great potential amongst CGI animation and a personal favourite of mine, i recommend to all who enjoy common and sarcastic humour along with the witty banter that the 'sidekick' Donkey brings to this and the classical good vs. bad charade because lets face it, from the first 5 seconds of seeing Lord Farquard we now there is no major threat or competition even to Shrek."
594,Shrek,9,8 December 2007,Best Shrek movie.,"This is the first Shrek movie and like all the others it is the best one of them all. This is the best one because it is the first time we have ever seen Shrek and all the rest of the characters. It has lots of comedy. Let me tell you the comedy in this movie will make you fall off your seat laughing at it. The story in this one is really good because as I said before it is the first time we ever seen Shrek and the rest of the characters and it tell how they all met and they done that really good. I also love the voice choice like mike myers as Shrek, Cameron Diaz as princess, Eddie Murphy as donkey etc. So make sure you rent or buy this Shrek movie because it is really good. I am Sure you enjoy this movie and have a good time watching it.Overall score ********* out of ********** **** out of *****"
595,Shrek,10,23 June 2007,One of the best animated movies i've seen!!!,"This movie had all the ingredients to become a success...First it was a love story, and although an animated picture I enjoyed it a lot..Second the voices of the main characters were borrowed from very popular actors such as Eddie Murphy,Cameron Diaz,Mike Myers and John Lithgow...This movie was also an adventure, and it was fun to see Shrek doing things differently in order to accomplish his objectives... Also seeing a lot of characters from the most famous fairy tales was great , even if they don't play an important role in this story...Best of all, it was an interesting comedy who had a lot of funny scenes and made me laugh pretty easily, thus making this film very pleasant for me..."
596,Shrek,6,5 June 2007,Don't Watch it More than Once or Twice!,"I saw ""Shrek"" for the first time when it came out back in 2001, and found it mildly funny. However, the next time I saw it, the fun was all pretty much gone, and I saw the film for what it really was: not that great.""Shrek"" is the story of the adventures of an ogre named Shrek, played by Mike Myers. No surprises there. When his swampy home is invaded by fairy tale creatures, Shrek embarks on a journey with his new companion Donkey (Eddie Murphy) to find who is responsible. This journey leads him to the scheming Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Farquaad asks Shrek and Donkey to fetch him the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). This is where the story really begins. ""Shrek"" is basically a parody of fairy tales in general. There's a wolf in Grandma's drag, a ""terrorizing"" female dragon, three blind mice dressed like modern blind men, among many others. Unfortunately, the fun of seeing these caricatures and the way they interact wears off after a little while, revealing the film for what it really is: a clichéd fairy tale in itself. The plot is something we've seen a thousand times in the very fairy tales that the film tries to poke fun at.Still, ""Shrek"" is certainly fun for a while. The animation is really neat and unique, bringing out the actors who voice the characters. Also, there are some really funny bits with Fiona and Robin hood's band of merry men, as well as some chuckles about Farquaad's Magic Mirror.Overall, the film is pretty good fun the first time you see it, and does have some really funny moments. I'd recommend that you rent this one and buy the sequel instead.7/10"
597,Shrek,,20 May 2007,An unexpected success.,"Unlike the common fairy tales that everyone is familiar with. Shrek is a fairytale with new attitude and style.The story begins with and focuses on Shrek, an Ogre who enjoys living in his own swamp. People are afraid of him because of his looks. Because of that he lives alone. Right until a band of fairytale creatures came because they were forced off of their homes. Reason why is because of Prince name Lord Farquot who wants his kingdom of Dulock to expand more.Accompanied with a talking donkey, who is slightly annoying to Shrek. Are on a quest to meet with this Lord Farquot in getting his swamp back. Since the power hungry prince owns Shrek's land, he makes a deal with Shrek in rescuing a Princess Fiona for him. He wants to marry Fiona so he can fulfill in becoming King of Dulock. Shrek agrees with this deal and is about to have more than a quest to fulfill. And Princess Fiona is more than your average princess.I didn't expected this movie to be a big success. But I got to admit, that it's a classic for a CGI. Besides the unique storytelling, and humor, the visuals and texture are all well done. PDI, who made the movie did an excellent job in adding so much detail in all of the backgrounds. Every time you'd watch this movie, you'll notice small bits you didn't notice from before.I also like the use of parodies and in jokes on Disney. The choices for the main characters are clever. Including Eddie Murphy making the movie funny as Donkey. And Mike Myers fits the role of Shrek so perfectly.If you like mild humor comedies with action, and fantasy. Then Shrek is the right choice for that category."
598,Shrek,9,12 May 2007,A good animation film,"This is one of my favorite animated films, even though I like the sequel more. This is based on the book in case you forgot what it was based on. It's about this ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers, Austin Powers) who has to go on this quest with this donkey named Donkey (Eddie Murphy, Nutty Professer) that won't shut up. Then he meets Fiona (Cameron Diaz, There's Something About Mary), who at first dislikes but secretly likes her. But cocky Lord Farquad (John Lithgow, unknown films) wants her all to himself. Will they live happily ever after? I also recommend Shrek 2. It's a comedy-family film. I own it. So rent it, watch it, laugh and if you love it, own it. XD."
599,Shrek,7,1 April 2007,Great fun. SPOILERS,"Although I do not think it is the best computer-animated film ever, it is still a nice film to watch. I actually think that it is a little overrated. Still, though, this is a fun film. The voice acting is good, and I like the humor and story.Shrek is an ogre who lives alone in a forest. Then he meets an annoying donkey. Then his forest is overrun by mythical creatures. Lord Farquaad tells Shrek that if he rescues a princess named Fiona from a dragon he will get the creatures out of the forest. Shrek and Donkey go to a castle and rescue Fiona. They make their way towards Farquaad. Farquaad wishes to marry Fiona. Donkey then finds out that Fiona is an ogre at night. When they get back Farquaad almost marries Fiona but the wedding is stopped by Shrek and Donkey. Farquaad is then eaten by the dragon.This is a good film, but it is not the greatest.7/10"
600,Shrek,8,26 December 2005,A Good Film! (Contains Spoilers),"A good film! Enjoyable. A good family movie which was one of the best animated films I have ever seen. Really good family viewing. I bet families flocked to the cinemas worldwide to see this. It was well worth it! Good family film. Good acting and voice overs, performed well, good acting abilities from all, good one liners, good script, performed well, hit target audiences and genres it set out to achieve, really good and amazing. Slightly better than Shrek 2 as well. Well done to all cast and crew who put in all efforts to make this movie great family viewing. Well done, great for children. Overall, I give this an 8. Well done."
601,Shrek,6,29 June 2005,A green faeces belly flops into showbiz,"When I watched this animated film, I was always expecting it to be a huge sellout. And I was correct. Look at the proof: Stuffing a long list of good actors into 80 minutes; shoving a pop song into a portion of the film every five minutes. And the most perverse thing is, it's about a big ogre and his companion who can talk and is a donkey! Who is in love with a dragon! Seriously, the creators of this had better get a few tips from Toy Story and stop sticking sexual innuendos into any space they can find: ""Heh, I've gotta save me ass!"" Because this is getting old real fast.The best bit is the part with the gingerbread man, and it's the only part I actually laughed at instead of a little chuckle.""Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm the GINGERBREAD MAN!!!"" Lord Farquad is a legend, and no one can excuse him of that title."
602,Shrek,9,18 April 2005,Great movie,"I loved this movie! The characters look real and the actors and actresses playing them did a really good job. What do you get when you mix comedy, drama, some singing, a donkey, and an ogre? Shrek! I love the karaoke part at the end. Eddy Murphy singing ""Baby got back"" was great. And Mike Myers singing in the Shrek accent was funny too. This is definitely worth the rental price. I rented it quite a few times. It's one of those movies I actually don't mind watching with my little sister, even after the hundredth time. We had fun naming all the storybook characters. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Shrek says ""I've got to save my ass."" I thought it was funny because of the double meaning."
603,Shrek,,15 April 2005,"DULOC = ""Dull Orange County"" - home of Disneyland","Am I the only person who noticed that DULOC might mean ""Dull Orange County""? Disneyland - one of Disney's most recognizable assets - is located in Orange County California - a notoriously boring area. I read at least one other viewer's theory that the name DULOC is a reference to something related to Notre Dame University (Notre Dame du Lac). The basis for his conclusion was that one of the writers or producers went to Notre Dame and that the castle in Duloc was a replica of the chapel at Notre Dame. However, since the castle is more universally recognized as a stylized replica of Sleeping Beauty's castle from Disneyland - and given the number of Disney references throughout Shrek and Shrek 2 - I like my idea better. Does anyone agree with me?"
604,Shrek,8,30 March 2005,Truly the greatest fairy tale never told...,"I've lost track of how many times I've seen this great film. I believe the number is below ten, but I'm not even sure of that. It somehow never gets old, the jokes remain fresh. Every once in a while, when I get the chance to see this film, I sit down and my laugh 'till my sides ache. It's about time someone decided to make a spoof movie making fun of fairy tales... I mean, they have been around for a few hundred years. In this film you will see just about every fairy tale creature poked fun at, and it's hilarious. The plot is very good, and quite original, for being based so much on typical fairy tale formula. The pace is great, you're rarely, if ever, bored; even on repeated viewings. The acting is pretty much flawless, and the talented main cast create an impressive number of laughs throughout the film. The characters are nicely fleshed out and interesting, for being based so heavily on fairy tale stereotypes. The humor is excellent; the comic timing of the gags and jokes is impeccable, and Myers and Murphy make a great comedy team(quite astounding since, according to the trivia, none of the voice actors actually met each other). The casting is perfect, and that is something that really, really, REALLY needs to be in order for an animated feature. As much as I love Steve Buscemi, even I can tell that he was completely miscast in the Final Fantasy movie. The dialog is well-written, with plenty of quotable lines. The whole thing is full of very talented and clever writing, both in dialog and in general... many memorable scenes as well. There's plenty of great music in there as well... not really one single piece of music on the soundtrack that I dislike. No loud or annoying tracks, but good, old-fashioned quality music. Not much else to say, except that I urge you to see this film, unless you can't stand fairy tales at all(which would require more hatred for them than even I have, a feat nearly impossible to accomplish) since it is, in the end, a fairy tale, no way around that. Happy end and everything. So, if you're not sure, go check out a trailer or the memorable quotes page. I recommend this to just about anyone who is at least a teenager and who won't completely fall apart when they see fairy tales being made the butt-end of jokes. 8/10"
605,Shrek,9,29 March 2005,"Oh oh pick me, pick me, me , me .,me","This movie is excellent for people of all ages. It has a great storyline and the humor and jokes are really good. Eddie Murphy does a fantastic job as the voice of donkey. The characters are unforgettable and the music is really good. The Shreck in the swamp karaoke dance party is also awesome. I think the movie has a good moral to it to: don't judge someone before you get to know them;don't judge by what you see on the outside but rather look deeper on whats inside. My favorite character without a doubt is Donkey, he is really funny. Although I like the second movie too I think the first one is better personally. I would recommend this movie to anyone no matter what the age, this is a movie for anyone and everyone."
606,Shrek,,30 July 2004,One of the best CG films ever,"There's a good chance you're deliberately trying to kill Disney if you put together countless fairy tale marvels and then mash them to pulp. 'Shrek' is a fairy tale story from DreamWorks, starring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow. Shrek (Myers) is an ogre who lives in a swamp, not wanting to meet anyone, and dispatching the occasional band of torch-bearing villagers with consummate ease. Until a bunch of fairy tale creatures are relocated to his land by Lord Farquaad (Lithgow), a vertically-challenged tyrant who wants to cleanse his land of the magical creatures. When Shrek and Donkey (Murphy), a fast-talking jackass who tags along with the ogre to lead him to the kingdom, reach Farquaad's realm of DuLoc, they defeat all his knights. The Lord strikes a bargain with Shrek: if Shrek and Donkey can rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) from her dragon-guarded castle, he will give Shrek his swamp back. So the duo set off. 'Shrek' is unlike any other animated film before. Instead of the righteous, heroic protagonist of traditional Disney fare, the star here is a temperamental, rather unlikable fellow, it being his inclination to be hostile as he correctly thinks everybody hates him. Donkey is his only real friend, the one who forgives Shrek for his despicable behavior, as he is even astier to Donkey than he is to most others. Fiona is the typical high-strung princess, not taking kindly anyone who compromises her dignity, and a true believer in true love, something Shrek scoffs at. The animation is revolutionary, looking more realistic than anything before. However, in three years, 'Shrek 2' and 'Finding Nemo' have surpassed it. 'Shrek' is something for all ages, except for the overprotective parents who mind the occasional rude joke. On the whole, the comedy of the film is what makes it timeless. 'Shrek' is a must-watch for anyone."
607,Shrek,,5 July 2004,Finally...,"A film that lampoons the ever popular kiddy fairy tale genre! I don't know about you, but I've gotten pretty tierd of some of these stupid pixy dust piece of crap movies. I've been ready for something to blow it to pieces, and by the grace of the almighty god, we were given Shrek.*spoilers dead ahead*Like I said, Shrek makes fun of the run of the mill Disney fairy tale film. It's about this Oger named Shrek who lives in a swamp long ago. He lives in solitude (except for the occasional angry mob trying to kill him). Unfortuitly, for him and ""fairy tale things""-(from the film)across the land, lord farquad, who is basically in charge of the place, says that all the fairy tales people must be taken to the swamp of Shrek's residence. Well to say the least, Shrek is not happy about this, so with his new donkey friend (whom he saved earlier) they we're on there way to protest to Lord Farquad. They finally get there (by the way his castle is a Disneyland wanna be). Shrek and donkey stumble upon the ""royal arena"" where something is going on (im not quite sure what). Anyway, as expected, everyone is afraid of shrek, and Farquad orders his knights to kill Shrek and donkey. Well, Shrek and donkey end up in a WWF style fight with the kinghts that is just hilarious. Because of this, Fraquad sends Shrek on a quest to find princess Fiona (you see, the talking mirror from Snow White told him that he should marry her, another hilarious scene). If Shrek finds Fiona and returns to Dulock (the name of the kingdom)with her, he gets the swomp back. This is surly a classic film, one that was completely different and extremely funny. With an all-star cast (Mike Myers, Eddie Murhpy, Camron Diaz, and John Ligthow) this is a delightful movie that everyone can enjoy. Thank you dreamworks, this is surly your trademark film. By the way, Shrek was such a great movie, they made a new category in the academy awards because of it (best animated film), if thats not the mark of a legendary film, I don't know what is."
608,Shrek,9,15 June 2004,The greatest animated film ever made. YES better than Finding Nemo,"Who doesn't like Shrek. Well silly question. Most of us like Shrek and even though I think Mike Myers has been in some quite honestly $&""(! (I don't swear plus kids are on this websites)films sucha as the cat in the hat he is wonderful in this. Despit him playing the Scottish ogre who says ""dowwn"" instead of ""doon"" the proper Scottish accent he plays Shrek well while Eddie Murphy also known for appearing in bad films like Daddy day care and the haunted mansion voices Donkey the well ... donkey! is OK in this. A must see.8/10 Brilliant, brilliant and even more brilliant"
609,Shrek,8,7 June 2004,Do you know the muffin man?,"Shrek is a computer animated film starring Mike Meyers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, and the fabulous Conrad Vernon. It won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Film (by the way, Waking Life was unfairly unnominated...Jimmy Neutron?), and rightly so, even though Monsters Inc. was equally deserving. Shrek was not only one of the funniest Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Family/Fantasy/Romances you'll ever see, but it also holds an important message, especially in Hollywood from which it sprang. Shrek is a sort of rebel. Its statement is simple and clear: anything can be beautiful. You don't have to be doused in makeup and look artificially pleasing to the eye, which is so prominent in Hollywood and therefore prominent in America. Shrek states that beauty lies (yes...) in your heart. But besides its refreshing message and ending, it's also extremely funny. With countless fairy tale references, such as the muffin man, Pinocchio, Robin Hood, Snow White, little red riding hood, etc., this is one enjoyable and clever film. It does has its share of potty humor, but thanks to its ending, and its jokes, it has enough vulgarity to be rebellious and enough beauty to be wonderful.My grade: 8/10"
610,Shrek,5,22 May 2004,"This is a kid's movie.  Nothing more, nothing less.","I made the mistake of buying all the hype that ""Shrek"" was a film for all ages, a film with such wonderful and unique humor and vision that age would not factor into the viewing experience. Boy, was I WRONG. Let me make myself clear: if you are a parent and looking for a mildly amusing film that you can watch along with your young child, then by all means, ""Shrek"" would be a perfect selection. But if you are looking for a film to watch by yourself or with other adults, don't waste your time with ""Shrek."" Maybe this is obvious advice, but unfortunately I never received this advice. All I received was loads and loads of comments about how this film is entertaining for all ages and blah-blah-blah. So, if your age is in the single-digits, this film is for you. If not, there is very little to like about ""Shrek."" If you are dead-set on seeing a film that is charming and entertaining for all ages, see ""Babe"" instead."
611,Shrek,9,25 May 2004,"Funny, funny funny!","It's not often that you can sit and watch a great movie with your kids, one that works on two levels but this is one of the few that does this, and very successfully.At first, I really had no interest in this, what I thought, odd movie and did my best to avoid watching it for over a year. But, when the video was released, I did break down and rented it and am I ever glad I did. This is a great comic romp which both the kids and the parents can enjoy. Kids will laugh at the utterly funny story, characters and happenings while parents will get a good laugh at the throw back to some of their favorite flicks. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as usual and adds the most to this funny movie. Add the really great animation and you have a great watch for the family!9/10"
612,Shrek,9,16 May 2004,Very good,"I have to say I was completely awed by the amazing 3D animation in this movie. Built on that is a solid story about an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers) who is sent on a quest by Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) to rescue Princess Fiona ( Cameron Diaz ) from a fire breathing dragon so that Lord Farquaad can marry her and become king. Along for the ride is Donkey (Eddie Murphy). The voice acting is very well done (John Lithgow is my favorite) and the music and sound effects created a nice story book atmosphere. Cameo appearances by many classic fairy tale charcters also adds some laughs to the movie. This will, no doubt, become an animation classic in years to come."
613,Shrek,9,12 May 2004,A Great Comedy and Animated Film,"I loved Shrek. It might not be the best animated film but it does have incredible animation which is worth definitely the price of your money to see the film. The Gingerbread man scene was very funny and I loved the character's voice. The donkey played by Eddie Murphy was outstandingly hilarious. ""I'm making waffles!""  I do like the fights also. It's kind of funny how Shrek is so big, he just barely pushes those knights of of him very easily. Dreamworks finally makes an animated film that is great without copying Pixar's work like the films that are called ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"" But oh well. Surely you will have to see this because I know you will enjoy it as much as I did.9/10"
614,Shrek,,29 April 2004,No.1 Animation film of all time!!,"In my opinion, not only was Shrek a brilliant movie, it's also my #1 Animation film EVER! (except perhaps Shrek 2 when that comes out). Eddie Murphey is really funny as Donkey! It is my #3 Film of all time, with the Harry Potter movies in front. On the top 250, this is about #136. It should be somewhere like between 10 - 20. As it is so brilliant. These are my top 10 animation films.1.Shrek 1 2.Monsters Inc 3.Finding Nemo 4.Toy Story 2 5.Toy Story 6.The Emprors New Groove 1 7.The Lion King 1 8.TIE: Beauty and the Beast 1 , Hercules 9.Lilo and Stitch 1This is a must see for everyone!"
615,Shrek,,26 April 2004,This Could Change the World,"I'm not kidding. This is one of the very few fairy tale movies to actually practice the themes that it preaches. At the end of the movie, the story establishes that people don't need to be ""beautiful"" in the traditional sense of the word, but whereas other fairy tales fall short, and give some excuse to turn them both into rich supermodels, instead, Fiona continues to be an ogre, and the story ends on a ""happily ever after"" note with them still living in a swamp.Now, let's take a Disney movie as a contrasting example. Like, Aladdin. So at the end, the moral of the story is that Aladdin was a diamond in the rough despite being at the bottom of the social class barrel. But to live happily ever after, he needs to become a Prince.Shrek is of course renowned for its amazing visuals, which it certainly has in large supply. While the animation is superb with every character, I was especially impressed with Fiona, who was the most life-like among them, and certainly would give Aki Ross a run for her money. But along with all the visuals is an interesting story, dynamic and original character who manage to fit into the loose, generic roles associated with the genre (hero, damsel, sidekick) while defying the archetypes that usually tie such characters down. I was especially delighted to see the guardian dragon actually become a character and not just a story vehicle.As the result, we end up with an interesting, visually stunning, and wholly entertaining twist on the stereotypical fairy tale. One of the best movies of the year, and I fully believe that it should've been nominated for best picture. Unfortunately, the Academy, being so terrified of computer animation as they are, created the ""Best Animated Feature"" sub award so that they could take all animated films out of the running for best picture."
616,Shrek,,9 April 2004,Fun Movie!,"SHREKVoices: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John LithgowRated: PGGenre: Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Romance/Fantasy/FamilyStar Rating: ***** out of 5Shrek is one of the best animation movies ever next to the ones from Disney/Pixar! The movie Shrek, is about a ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) who everyone thinks he is ugly and mean. Until one day when he met Donkey (Eddie Murphy) who liked him a lot and didn't care whether Shrek was ugly or not! So then these fairy tale characters come on Shrek's property by Lord Farquad. So then when Shrek and Donkey go to talk him, Farquad then sent him to go rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). So then when Shrek finds out that Fiona is in love with Shrek, Shrek goes to stop her from marrying Farquad, who just wanted to marry her just to become king. So then Shrek and Fiona are now married! I thought the entire movie was just fantastic, hilarious and enjoyable for people of all ages.BOTTOM LINE: VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD!"
617,Shrek,8,9 April 2004,An enjoyable comedy,"-----------------------------------SPOILERS-------------------------------
The reclusive ogre Shrek lives by himself in a swamp which is suddenly flooded with fairy tale creatures the evil Lord Farquaad banished. Intent on getting back his solitude, the ogre seeks out the Lord and beats up his best knights, which prompts Farquaad to choose him for a heroic quest: To free Princess Fiona from the clutches of a dragon...While there could have been better animation at some points, the dialog was filled with gags (and there were a lot of visual gags to boot). The storyline is a bit simple, but this is alleviated by it deliberately turning many a cliché on its head. The only thing I have a gripe with is the donkey. While this is generally a fun character who has many great lines, he has been compared to jar Jar Binks, and rightly so. He lacks Jar Jar's immense capability to annoy, but he becomes tiresome after some time. I can not really comment on the voice acting, as I have only seen the German version."
618,Shrek,,4 March 2004,Best movie to have to watch over and over because of small children.,"My kids would watch the same movie 6 times in a row with out tiring, if I let them. I was forced into daily showings of Shrek, and I can honestly say I still love it! When NBC played it on air a couple weeks ago I'm missed my normal Sunday Night line up just to watch it. We're on our third VHS copy now because we wear them out. I know we should buy it on DVD, but my children scratch theirs too easy. Anyways, I think it's refreshing. I'd like to see more movies that can capture both young and old as this has. Even my grandma likes it! And Yes, I am fully aware of what makes it rated PG. My children see worse on prime time tv. So Excited about Shrek 2!!!!"
619,Shrek,,21 February 2004,Suggestive humor inappropriate,I felt that some of the humor was inappropriate for children.  Kids already seem to get enough of this on their own without having it put in front of them on the movie screen. I know this is obviously supposed to be primarily a children's film though also enjoyable for adults.  I personally would have enjoyed it more without the suggestive humor - knowing that my children were not being exposed to this negativity.  Don't get me wrong - I did enjoy the movie and thought it was very funny - it just had several parts that I felt were NOT appropriate for children.
620,Shrek,10,9 January 2004,Really funny.,"This is the best animated movie I have ever seen. It is not only good for children but it is good for adults too. I loved it, especially Donkey played by Eddie Murphy, he did a lot of the jokes. Mike Myers as Shrek was funny as well. I recommend this for both adults and children. I give it 10 out of 10."
621,Shrek,10,7 January 2004,A masterpiece,"Excellent movie. Nice plot, marvelous sense of humor, a lot of messages. That's the result of talent making use of digital graphic art. Probably aimed more to adults, in order to grasp all its flavor. Congratulations to all of the contributors. A masterpiece."
622,Shrek,8,16 December 2003,Surprising,"Eddie Murphy is notorious for his horrible movies. His base acting, humor, and overall style has smeared the face of movies with shame (see ""Pluto Nash"" for an example. However, this movie is surprisingly and refreshingly different from all other movies with Murphy in it. This movie compines plesant animation with a crisp and silly story line with a voice-over cast that is simply perfect for the movie. Even though it is ultimately a child's movie, it gives excitement and pleasure to whomever sees it and is solidly recommended to anyone who asks."
623,Shrek,,14 December 2003,Superb,"This movie is great for the whole family. It has laughs around every corner and has practically worn out my DVD player watching it so many times. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy especially propel this movie into a universal comedy, which will be around for all ages."
624,Shrek,8,11 December 2003,Sweetly cynical,"Sweet, yet cynical...beautiful landscapes and textures colored by Myers's ""If it's not Scottish, it's crap"" skit from SNL (not a good thing). A faerie tale wrought with sarcasm and jaded one-liners.This movie is definitely for the adults in the family. The children should be spared this tired, jaded, and cynical view of the world presented by our hero and his side-kicking ass.While the story is typical, the characters are very well developed and the computer graphics are fantastic. The background textures and skin tones are beautifully realistic and you can tell there were many great talents devoted to this production. The textures of the trees, the characters, and even the facial hair growth of the characters was amazing. Too bad they did not put more into the story to rate this wonderful CGI treatment.Unfortunately, they did not, and it shows. The tritely delivered one liners, the cynical philosophies, and the jaded presentation of love and self esteem should probably not go directly into the minds of America's children. There are enough sources for this negative kind of thinking, in my opinion, and the children do understand what is being said. Never for a moment should you be under the misconception that they are ignorant of the underlying meanings of these adult-based jibes and insults.I love this movie, myself. But, having been a parent, I can safely say that were there small children about, they would not be watching Shrek very often; if at all, until they were old enough to understand that there is a difference between cynicism and sarcasm, and that what is funny is very seldom what is right.All that aside, as an adult, I love this movie. The story, as I have already stated, is a bit recycled, but nevertheless, it is classic. Unfortunately, the fairy tale portion of this production is more of a fairy tail.Though I loved the Donkey. This character (done well by Eddie Murphy) was the comedian, bouncing the one liners off of Shrek's ""straight-man"" persona, leaving Eddie Murphy to get all the laughs while Myers's character (working from the murky depths of a horribly muddled accent) must remain in the dark and gloomy mode, as ogres are not known to be very social creatures.The messages here are plain and simple, right from the start: love yourself, friends have value, and be true to yourself. Good messages which do come through the sarcastic wit and cynical philosophies, regardless of the strong delivery of these devices, but perhaps a bit watered-down by the time it filters through into children's minds.This is nevertheless, a fun movie with good characters, a classic good vs. evil format, and strong visual effects generated by true artisans in the field of computer graphics interface. I love the inclusion of the Dragon as a non-evil entity. Dragons are far too often the symbol of evil incarnate; an erroneous and unfair convenience generated by the Catholic church of the first millennium. After the Druid priests were converted, their ties with Dragon kind had to be severed in order to fully control the followers of these priests. Thus the link between Dragons and evil was created, established, and used wrongfully in their persecution. I found it philosophically and theologically heartening.But I digress.This is a fun movie, if you can hear the soundtrack over the cheering of the executives behind this production, and can manage to feel uplifted by the love story as it filters past the cold-hearted jibes and cynicism found throughout.If you haven't seen it, do so. It's well worth the 93 minutes invested. Just screen it first, if you plan on allowing your kids to view it. As I said, some of the philosophies are a bit cold and hard to stomach.It rates a 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :."
625,Shrek,,17 November 2003,Do you know the Muffin Man?,"I gotta say folks, Shrek is the best animated film i've EVER seen! With actors such as Mike Myers and the hilariously unforgettable Eddie Murphy who could go wrong, and of course, there are the best quotes in it you could ever imagine- ""Ogres are like...onions..."" Shrek says as he tears chunks off an onion whilst looking for inspiration to shut the very loveable Donkey up, and, in my opinion the best quote; ""Stubborn Jackass!! Smelly Ogre!!"".  If you've not seen this film yet, you HAVE to! And i mean HAVE to! Oh and one more thing guys, this is gonna sound really sad lol, but i go around quoting Shrek alllll the time! So, just remember, ""...you gotta have friends...!""......."
626,Shrek,9,3 November 2003,Simply fantastic!,"On friday i watched Shrek again, aftre the first time i´ve seen it has been about a year ago. What shall i say. I enjoyed it even more! Maybe it is because i didn´t watch the dubbed german version, but the original language, with a great Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz, but with an absolutely outstanding Eddie Murphy! Eddy, stop making crap movies, you haven´t been that good since BHC! There are so many fantastic ideas and wonderful jokes, i could not stop laughing the whole movie long. I cannot wait to see Shrek 2. This is one of the best comic/animated movie ever!"
627,Shrek,10,20 September 2003,So funny one of my favorite movies of all times,"I love this movie! I have watched about 25 times! It is so hysterical you can't help laughing the whole way through it. And the computer animation is great! Also this movie has a great moral. I also love the music video with all the characters at the end which included different characters versions of YMCA, I Like Big Butts and others but not to much to be annoying. It's so funny. One of my favorite characters is the little gingerbread man his so cute!"
628,Shrek,,5 September 2003,Vastly over-rated,"The 1990s was a strange decade for the Disney corporation, one which saw huge commercial success in its first half, and creative bankruptcy in its second.  Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and the Lion King were a hat-trick of classics that matched critical success with financial reward, but what followed was a series of repetitive features which proved the winning formula was being so streamlined that nothing else remained.  In Pocahontas, Hercules and Tarzan, we saw only a misfit who dreamt of being understood and a sidekick or two ready to chip in with the one-liners.  Even the more satisfying efforts, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Mulan, were burdened with the same old formula.  The theme of the underdog and his sidekick had long been a staple of Disney's output, but there had always been something more, something that elevated it above its repetition.  Now the bare bones were being presented as the living, breathing whole, and the feeling of déjà vu was becoming increasingly irritating.With Disney's offerings looking as stale as one of Lincoln's home made baps, and with the arrival of computer-generated animation, its rivals had their best chance yet at defeating the sleeping giant.  But somehow the opportunity was not matched with films of sufficient quality; The Pebble and the Penguin, Anastasia, Antz, Titan AE and The Road to El Dorado did little to fill the potential gap in the market.  If the response to Disney's stagnation was slow it can be easily understood given that animated features take three or four years to produce, but, still, an opportunity was being missed.In the Spring of 2001, patience was rewarded with Shrek, a CG animation from DreamWorks which wooed the critics, busted blocks and snatched the first ever Best Animated Feature Oscar from under Disney's noses, leaving poor old Walt spinning in his grave faster than a bottle at a pre-teen sleep-over. It was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch it, ready to embrace the cynicism and subversive humour that had been praised so highly.The story of an irritable green ogre sent to rescue a post-feminist Princess began well enough, starting, as so many Disney movies have started, with a book of fairytales being opened and narrated in a non-threatening tone. Suddenly, Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers, tore a page from the book and wiped his butt with it - a promising start.  Unfortunately, it hinted more at its level of humour than at its subversive nature; the jokes begin in the toilet, and there they remain.  The jokes about belching were outnumbered only by the jokes about farting, both of which were abandoned only once, for the high-class humour of seeing Shrek being hit in the groin.Further disappointment came in its feeble attempts to ridicule Disney's monopolistic use of fairytale clichés.  If a film is going to rubbish its predecessors it has to be smarter than the ones it attacks, but Shrek should have a dunce's hat plonked on its big, dumb, empty head.  Like Scream and Galaxy Quest, it comes across as being ill-informed, pointing out some clichés while blindly serving up others with a short memory and a straight face.  Beyond that, the same old Disney sentiment it spends the first forty minutes rubbishing comes on thick and fast in the second half, where we learn that beauty is only skin deep, that friendships should be valued, and that blah blah bliddy blah.Beyond fairytale cliché, Shrek suffers terribly from a mammoth helping of movie cliché.  Jobbing writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio serve up a story of complete conventionality, making us endure such lines as `It's quiet... too quiet' and having their wafer-thin plot hinge on a half-overheard conversation, a plot device so old it was invited to God's christening.Its various faults add up to a missed opportunity, its subversive streak as unconvincing as Mike Myers' Scottish accent.  Disney has its faults - now more than ever - and it deserves to be ridiculed, but it has to be done by something altogether smarter than this.  After all, Shrek is the misfit who dreams of being understood, Eddie Murphy's Donkey is the sidekick on hand to chip in with the one-liners, the Princess teaches us that beauty is only skin deep, and nothing is more Disney than that."
629,Shrek,10,3 September 2003,Simply Marvellous!,"Ohmigod! Shrek is amazing! I am not usually a big fan of films like this but i thought Shrek was superb. The animation was excellent-opening up a new generation of dazzling special effects. The film was light, funny and a great remake of a classic cinderella type story. One of the best animated feature films ever made! 10/10"
630,Shrek,10,28 August 2003,"Wonderful Revolution of the ""Fairy Tale""","Talking about bad luck for Disney Studios, just in the year the Academy finally conceded to create the Oscar for animated picture, their Monsters, Inc (very good, by the way) had to run against simply the best one ever made by any other studio.Shrek is original, hysterical, delightful.It makes fun of practically all the fairy tales classics.
The prince is the bad guy, the ogre is the hero, the princess ridiculize her own stereotype.Even in the ""happily ever after"" ending the movie remains true to its nature.And, last but no least - the donkey as the sidekick is priceless. Eddie Murphy at his best."
631,Shrek,,20 August 2003,MUCH better than I expected,"*********** Possible Spoilers ***************I put off watching this for a long time after it was released because my impression of it from trailers was that it would be one long rude noise, so to speak.  Then we went to a friend's house and they put this on, and I watched it and was very pleasantly surprised.  There is a potty humor element, unfortunately, but it's not as predominant as I had expected, and the story is REALLY well-done other than that.  The jokes are funny, the characters are enjoyable, and the animation is great.  Most of all, I liked the ending -- a pleasant surprise in this world where looks are paramount. I'd love to see more like it."
632,Shrek,9,11 August 2003,Shrek rules,"If you, like me, are tired to death with Walt Disney's nerd movies and thought that Shrek was just another bad cartoon movie Shrek is just the pill you need.A classic childrens story with an adult twist. Mike Myers is far more funny as Shrek's voice than he has ever been on the screen (ok Wayne's world was funny) and Eddie Murphy is actually quite funny as long as you don't have to see him (sorry Eddie but I was a big fan back in days of Delerious and Raw). Shrek is the coolest hero ever. 9/10"
633,Shrek,8,9 August 2003,Refreshingly anarchic animated comedy(may contain MILD SPOILERS),"Shrek is a film which delights in making fun of the classic fairy tale's rites of passage with dollops of satire and a surprising amount of black comedy and (of course) a nice, sweet underlying message about beauty on the inside and never judging a book by its cover etc. etc.Shrek works so well because it is not specifically aimed at either adults or children and provides plenty of entertainment for both with the usual (rather crude) humour about flatulence, belching and so on to amuse kids and plenty of sly in-jokes and jabs at Disney that will raise a smile from adults.The plot of Shrek revolves around the eponymous title character who just happens to be a large green ogre.A loner with an inferiority complex, a stroppy attitude and bad breath, shrek certainly isn't the archetypal hero of a fairy tale, but none the less (or perhaps because of) he ends up being one of the more lovable creatures ever to be animated. Unbeknownst to Shrek however is the fact that times are decidedly turbulent for fairy tale creatures who are being systematically rounded up and evicted by the diminutive Lord Farquaad and unfortunately for shrek his swamp is the area they've been relocated to. Not content to share his home with Pinocchio, the three little pigs, tinkerbell and countless others, Shrek, accompanied by a talking donkey named er.. Donkey, sets out to speak to Farquaad and get rid of the 'squatters'. In the meantime Farquaad has chosen (under the advice of the magic mirror) to marry Princess Fiona (he chose her over Snow White and Cinderella), there is however a snag: she's imprisoned in a castle surrounded by lava and guarded by a dragon and for the pint sized Farquaad the idea of personally rescuing her is decidedly unnapealing. He therefore strikes a deal with Shrek: if Shrek rescues the princess he gets his swamp back free from the unwanted inhabitants. And so the adventure begins...........Shrek succeeds principally for two reasons, it's quartet of main characters and its humour. As previously mentioned Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers, not that you'd know; he adopts a Scottish accent which makes his voice almost unrecognizable) is refreshingly flawed and a welcome change from the bland heroes that populate cinema. Donkey(Eddie Murphy) is the stereotypical wise-cracking sidekick who is the films main source of comedy. The role is used in essentially every animated movie and the results usually vary from the good (Robin Williams;Aladdin) to the dire (Billy Crystal;Monsters Inc.) but Murphy is arguably the best yet (though I still think he is the weakest of the four main characters). Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is essentially a combination of the classic damsel in distress with the added twist of Diaz's 'Charlie's Angels' alter-ego which enables her to kick Monsieur Hood and his Merry Men's french butts in Matrix style slow motion Kung Fu. And last (but certainly not least) is lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) an old fashioned villain who, despite being devious and nasty, is not the cold embodiment of evil most films try to create.Of course there are so many repeatable lines of dialogue and endless visual gags that you could easily compile a 'greatest hits' selection (my personal favourite is Cinderella and Snow White brawling over a wedding bouquet). Like all fairy tales Shrek must have a happy ending, but this time there's an added twist(which isn't even hinted at until 2/3 of the way into the movie) just to make sure the movie maintains its freshness. The only slight quibble I have is the rather confusing contradiction in the film's moral sub-plot about how one should not judge people because of their physical appearances, and yet the film happily stereotypes the midget Farquaad as a Napoleonic megalo maniac, its by no means offensive but it left me rather bemused at what the film was trying to say.All in All an excellent animated feature (certainly better than the awful Monsters Inc.) I give it 8 out of 10 and strong recommendation"
634,Shrek,9,23 July 2003,Great story!,This is a fantastic story! The film is very well executed and is a fine addition to anyones film library. What makes this film truly great are the wonderful voices! These folks are all great professionals and their voices carry the emotions of the characters perfectly. I truly enjoyed this and plan to acquire it soon.
635,Shrek,10,13 July 2003,The best animated movie ever!!!,"Shrek is so funny, it has a great story and the look of it is amazing! The whole movie pretty much makes you laugh and the action scenes look spectacular.  One of my favorite 'eye candy' scenes is when shrek breaks a keg and incredibly realistic ale comes out.  I couldnt have asked for a better movie!!!  My whole family loved it, (it is my mom's favorite movie now), ALL of my friends love it and it is just an overall great movie.  I give it 4 out of 4 stars because; Amazingly good story Great Acting (I love Cameron Diaz and Mike Meyers any time on film, and they are great here, and I actually found Eddie Murphy to be hilarious for once. Plus all the voices work great!) Great effects, the whole movie looks amazing The sound effects and the music is great as A Must See Movie-literally!"
636,Shrek,,10 July 2003,"oh, shrek, shrek, shrek...","hillariously good movie that brings together all your favorite fairy tales and even a few mother goose stories, who would have thought such an innocent seeming movie would make you laugh so hard? then again, you gotta look at the fact that it stars usual multi-character mike meyers in the lead role as an... ogre??? yep, an OGRE, and BIG mouth eddie murphy as a donkey friend. somewhere in the middle is cameron diaz and john lithlow... odd combination, but the result is  very entertaining comedy fun for all ages. if at least one of these loving characters doesn't find a place in your heart, with all due respect, you must be dead."
637,Shrek,,11 July 2003,Great movie,"This was a great animated movie, with a good voice character Mike Myers.This is filled with good laughs!This is an enjoyable movie, and I recommend it to anyone who likes animated comedy10/10"
638,Shrek,,27 June 2003,Hilarious and Cute,"This movie is beyond adorable. This movie is a spoof on fairy tales, a feel-good movie, a fun movie to memorize, a movie that everyone would enjoy (though generally guided toward teen audiences)and basically just a movie you'll want to watch over and over again.Mike Myers, famous for Austin Powers, is making a comic comeback as a lovable, hatable Ogre who's life is turned upside down when he runs into a strange and talkative donkey (Wonderfully and naturally portrayed by Eddie Murphy) Set on a quest assigned by the great Lord Farquad (Hilariously portrayed by John Lithgow) to rescue Princess Fiona (adorably portrayed by Cameron Diaz) from a tower guarded by a flirty GIRL dragon.
I would reccommened this to anyone, especially those who like to make fun of fairy tales. This is the perfect topping."
639,Shrek,8,17 June 2003,"Definately an anti-Disney film, but has the same humble qualities to any pixar film","Shrek is truly a gem in the standards of animation, which it truly deserved any award that it received, especially the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Why? Well, it was just the best-animated film of that year!
A truly unique adaptation to a children's picture book, where in the book Horribly hideous Shrek leaves home and terrifies everyone he encounters in his search for his equally ugly bride. While the feature film makes this somewhat simple children's story into a hilarious anti-Disney animated comedy! Now, according to the film, our title character (voiced brilliantly by Mike Myers) is an agreeable enough ogre who wants to live his days in peace. When the diminutive Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) evicts local fairy tale creatures (including the now-famous Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man), they settle in the ogre's swamp and Shrek wants answers from Farquaad. A quest of sorts starts for Shrek and his new pal, a talking donkey (played brilliantly by the incredible comedian Eddie Murphy), where battles have to be won and a princess (Cameron Diaz) must be rescued from a dragon lair in a thrilling action sequence! This plot is the kind of entertainment that certainly made the film the beloved classic that it is today! This is definitely suitable for anyone that hates Disney films (so I will like it as I cannot stand their over-rated pieces of work) as this spoofs most of their films, from Pinocchio all the way to Mulan, was ironically Murphy was involved! However, I disagree that it spoofs Pixar, except spoofing the good A Bug's Life. But, to be honest I find Pixar branded Disney, just because this conglomerate presents their work is a bit pointless, as all the work of Pixar is ten times better then the stuff Disney spew out to the public throughout the years. But I do not just make a contrast to Pixar films because that it is done wonderfully in computer animation, or that one of its films, Monster's Inc., was up for that Oscar too, but because it possesses the qualities that make Pixar films excellent. First of all the humour, visually and verbally, great music, by earning Bafta, Saturn, and Grammy nominations to prove it, and family appeal, colourful characters for the kids and interesting humour and spoofs of action films for the adults!So what I can I say to conclude my review. Great Voices provided by a brilliant cast to one of the best films to be based on a children's book! In addition, with many Annies for its impressive animation, this film has plenty of awards to prove its brilliance! Overall, definitely an anti-Disney film but has the same humble qualities to any Pixar film!"
640,Shrek,9,3 June 2003,Truly the greatest fairy tale ever told,"This ogre-sized adventure is my favourite animated film. The ending is a bit slow and sappy compared to the rest of the film but other than that is brilliant. Shrek is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over - something that I usually find impossible to do.It's full of little subtle jokes that I don't manage to pick up on for a while and has some of my favourite actors in it - John Lithgow and Mike Myers.The storyline may not be completely original (not that it's intended to... the whole thing is making fun of previous movies) but it makes by with it's wit and charm.Of course I got the real expert on Animated films, my younger sister -to give me her opinion on it. It's her favourite too.9/10"
641,Shrek,10,26 May 2003,Inspired animation,"I'm glad I finally got round to seeing this movie and I was pleasantly surprised because Shrek has the guts to follow it's own path and doesn't feel the need to follow the same old formula's used by so many film makers today. Yes we recognise that it's essentially a love story, BUT IT HAS A GOOD SCRIPT and it's also about the battle to be brave. I hope that children do see how the fairy tale characters we love so much are set free by this film. They are able to express their individuality as we all should. Children are much tougher and much more intelligent than adults give them credit and it's views such as those that we hear in these forums which dull a child's mind.The 3D character animation is top quality for it's day, intelligent and often subtle. This film breaks a lot of boundaries previously uncrossed in family animation. Take your children to see it, talk to them about it afterwards and see why they like it - find out who they are! Shrek addresses the world we live in today, it celebrates film making and story telling and it has a wonderful, broad range of characters. If anything there wasn't enough time to pack it all in. It wasn't perfect, but it was very good and certainly A BREATH OF FRESH AIR."
642,Shrek,,24 May 2003,hilarious,i love mike myers. sure he's somewhat crude but he's still funny. now i usually don't watch animated movies unless they are disney. but i wasn't close minded on this one. disney makes good movies of course. why not other companies take a stab at it? a delightful comedy intended for both children and adults. i do think a lot of the humor is more for adults though. i was surprised to hear a few cuss words. children still love it though. aside from that..its a very good movie. 8 stars out of 10...........
643,Shrek,6,20 May 2003,"Okey, okey!","It´s okey, not great, not bad..........good ending! Mike Myers is great and Eddie Murphy pretty good! The kids love it.......................I think I´ll give it 6.78!!!!"
644,Shrek,,3 May 2003,The Dreamiest Dreamworks film yet,"Dreamworks is NOT one of my favorite movie companies. So when I went to see Shrek, I was happily shocked. Since I'm 18, I like to make fun of fairytales, and this is the perfect medicine for me. ""He huffed und he puffed und he--signed an eviction notice."" Hilarious, extravagant, 98%."
645,Shrek,8,29 March 2003,Very Good Animated Movie,"""Shrek"" is every bit as good as the classic Disney animation films (or at least many of them). Of course, animation has improved over the decades, ""Shrek"" being filmed using the new 3-D CGI. But animation is not what made the Disney classics great movies. It was the stories, the characters and the music. The full sweep of drama, comedy, and adventure that was available to live action, except with animation. These movies are for adults as much as for kids. ""Shrek"" is also in this class, although the story might seem a little thin and pedestrian. And the moral of the story, well it's been updated a bit to accommodate 21st century tastes. Nonetheless I recommend this movie for adults and kids alike."
646,Shrek,10,4 February 2003,"watch it over, gets better every time","I've seen it 5 times, my wife - 10 and the children - i don't know... For someone who loves movies and usually not the trivial ones that should mean something. I saw some of the comments in the forum and was surprised to a certain extent because it is hard for me to imagine that someone who has seen the film would classify it as ""children animation"" and would judge it by that criteria. Yes, children like it, it's fun for them, but I don't think they can get more than 1/3rd of the fine (and not so ""refined"") humor in this movie. Both Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers give lifetime performances as donkey and Shrek. Jokes are really nice, as well as at least a dozen of classical phrases that you can apply in any true-life situation. Animation is awesome and soundtrack is a big hit. not less than 100 out of 100! hhhhmmmmm, there's probably a serious reason why donkeys don't write :)"
647,Shrek,8,19 January 2003,a great good time,"This is a rollicking fun movie, full of gags, music, a princess, a dragon, an ogre, and -- best of all -- a talking donkey who steals the show.  Many of the gags are pretty gross (I admit I could have done without that), others are clever. (My favorite:  a sign in a field that says ""you are parked in lancelot"").  A thoroughly fun film, if you don't mind the gross stuff.  I rate it at ""8""."
648,Shrek,10,17 January 2003,The greatest fairy tale ever retold,"I never really want to watch animated feature, because I think it's only for kids. I ever noticed the fuzz about ""Shrek"", and from what I heard ""Shrek"" is a fabulous film. But it's still doesn't impressed me, because it's only an animated feature, right?And then, yesterday, incidentally I watched it on video, and (as you can guess) I was wrong, because ""Shrek"" is more mature than I thought. It has everything, comedy, action, adventure and romance. I know a fairy tale is usually a simple romance for kids, but in ""Shrek"", you will find a kind of mature love story cloaking in a sweet romantic comedy. I was really moving by Shrek and Fiona romance tale.The plot line is quite simple and rehash the fairy tale that we ever heard, but made by the fresh many fairy tale used to do, but in such a very extreme different ways! I just love it.Mike Meyers and Eddy Murphy contributed their voice with an powerful force. Cameron Diaz is really show her spirit and make ""Shrek"" more delicious to digests.10/10"
649,Shrek,,8 January 2003,Shrekin good fun!,"I was shocked how much i enjoyed this film. It's so well done. I like to pick flaws in things, it's my nature, and especially with films as i've done a degree in film critique, but there are many good points about this particular effort.I'm very sceptical about 'childrens films' with adult content, but was quite surprised and disturbed at some of the disgusting things which happened here. It wouldn't shock a child, im sure, but then i don't think they'd appriciate how crass some of the humour is. They would not get certain references either, i'm under no illusion about how in-touch children are, but there's definately a lot of adultivity here, and its good to see.My 30 year old girlfriend made me see this. I think that speaks volumes for it's audience, it's been in her regular rotation ever-since.In terms of plot, well, it goes down your average fairy-tale road, but with so many different citations its bound to raise a smile (if not just through youthful reminiscance alone).The settings are beautifully rendered as are the characters, the voice-overs are great (though Mike Myers ""Scottish"" accent is a little annoying as a Brit!), the film is just wholly good.Not amazing, but deffinately worth watching, a MUST (im sure) if you have children, and dont want to be bored with their regular drivel!"
650,Shrek,9,12 January 2003,Star rating: 5 out of 5,"Shrek is a 'fairytale' with all the traditional ingredients - a princess locked in a tower, a hero on a quest to save her, a scheming villain, true love leading to a happy (if somewhat unexpected) ending, and a supporting cast including everyone from a delightfully French Robin Hood to the gingerbread man.  However, Shrek is certainly not a traditional fairytale.  For a start, the hero is, by his own admission, a big, smelly, ugly ogre. Secondly, this is not only a movie for kids - much of the humour will only be fully appreciated by adults.  And Shrek will have *everyone* smiling, giggling and laughing out loud.  All of the characters have their funny and memorable quotes and scenes, but the best lines come from Donkey (although occasionally he seems to be trying just a little too hard for comic effect). The computer animation is stunning and with a just a little imagination you can see that the characters somewhat resemble the actors who provide their voices.  There is definitely a bit of Eddie Murphy in Donkey anyway.  It is perhaps the attention to detail that is most impressive - the facial expressions are just fabulous.   Shrek is a must-see film, because almost everyone will find something to like about it (although perhaps not those who like their fairy tales to be predictable and perfect).  But as Princess Fiona ultimately learns, 'perfect' is an illusion and only once you accept who you are, can you live happily ever after."
651,Shrek,8,29 December 2002,Change of Mind,"When I first walked in to the movie theatre, I was skeptical. I knew it was an animated cartoon-like film, and I was convinced it was going to be stupid. However, I quickly changed my mind and found myself enjoying myself. It was a cute and laughable movie, and I think anyone would enjoy it."
652,Shrek,7,3 January 2003,"Funny, but not as witty as expected","I heard since this movie came out on how funny this movie was with its adult themed humor, but I avoided it because it is from the same people that brought out Antz.  I finally gave in and saw it.  This movie is funny with some laughs, it also had a good story about inner and outer beauty.  The characters and voiceovers by Mike Myers and Eddy Murphy were hilarious. Even the ending gave a bittersweet ending instead of the usually happy one.But I did not find it clever or witty enough with the pop culture references.  It seems many were just reference for the sake of it instead of taking a sharp jab.  As for many of the Disney characters, too many were just there again, for the sake of it with their few seconds of screen time to do its thing so that we know who they are.  It is not that they didn't do anything with them, it is just that some were quite duds.  They could have done something smarter or a lot more hilarious with pop culture references and Disney characters, but they did not.The concept of inner beauty did not quite gist either, since the portrayl of King Farquaad as a short person signifies somehow his stature is what is lacking and he somehow has to compensate for it.The film tries to attract young audience by gross humor instead of wholesome characters like the do in Disney animations.  In doing so, it probably took a shortcut in the developing of the story.  The building up of the relationship between Shrek and the princess involves her showing she is not a prissy by burping in front of him.To sum it up, it is a funny movie with some heartwarming central story. Good for the teenage crowd, and decent for the adults."
653,Shrek,8,2 January 2003,Surprisingly good!,"I have had this movie for a few months now, but I didn't really bother to watch it, because I just didn't think it'd be that good. Well, seems I was wrong, once again, and that Shrek simply blew me away.I see it as a fairy tale movie about fairy tales, but also about our life. You get all the so called elements of a fairy tale, like magic creatures and beautiful romance scenes...big castles and horrid dragons. Just that this movie is a parody of the fairy tale world. Of course, a parody that remains a fairy tale, but through this different vision we get the fun out of it.The story is quite simple, and yet it has more ""layers"" than you'd expect. We get three characters, Shrek the ogre, Donkey (the donkey heh) and Princess Fiona, the one with two faces and the dragon. All four are lonely, but in fact they form two pairs. Initially in both pairs we see some clear opposites:Fiona beautiful, Shrek ugly; dragon huge, donkey small. But these differences come just from the aspect of these characters, and not from what they really are. Their meeting represents the end of their loneliness.There are a lot of scenes from other fairy tales, as this movie is actually based on them. It may lack in originality at times, if you really want to hear that. But it compensates through great humor. Also, there would be this nice town of lord Farquaad, named Duloc. It represents a town that seems perfect, but you just have to take a sharp look at it and notice how horrible life really is there. The people are being controlled by their small, yet horrible lord. Like the viewers that are present at a show - they see ""applaud"" they see ""laugh""...it's what they see and what they do because others tell them. It's not something you can rely on. It's a manipulated society, something which does happen in our world too...much too often sometimes. It's not right to say we have a flawless film on our hands, still it is a movie which many will enjoy, and most important will probably make you feel better. Isn't that what movies are about? Or at least in some high percentage..."
654,Shrek,,1 January 2003,great movie!,"From beginning to end this movie is great.  The voices and animation are awesome.  Eddie Murphy aka donkey is a riot in this movie. This movie has action, and comedy if you are a fan of those movies then you will love this movie.  After you see this movie just once you will want to see it again and again."
655,Shrek,10,20 December 2002,Hilarious,There is no doubt about it this has got to be one of the funniest movies ever.I saw the movie on tv and then went out and bought it.My favorite charactor was the donkey.The music was great! A must see movie for the entire family.
656,Shrek,,16 December 2002,WOW! Surprisingly good!,"Woo, not many bad things that I can say. At first, I was reluctant to see this movie because I was trying to grow up, and I thought that it was for kids- even though adults thought that it was great. However, I finally did see it, and WOW! was I shocked! It was excellent! Funny, interesting, and great songs all make this movie one of the best that I have ever seen. The actors who did the voices were great, the animation was also great, and I will mention the songs- well chosen. I especially loved the karaoke at the end. I've seen it three times and am still not bored of it. If you're planning to see it, well, do so and get it!"
657,Shrek,9,17 December 2002,Get better with every viewing,"I must admit that I was not very overwhelmed the first time I saw ""Shrek"". It wasn't as smart and heartwarming as I thought it would be and it had a mean edge to it's story and characters. Well, that was my first viewing. Another five or so viewings later I am willing to hail this movie as the masterpiece it is. True, it is not as cute and sugarcoated as your average Disney-saga, but now I consider it a big bonus. Instead you have some amazing characters who interact better than most live actors, a great but simple-to-follow story and lot's of funny lines and moments. And there ARE some heartwarming episodes! All the voices are superb in there parts, with an added bonus for Eddie Murphy (his best part in YEARS!) and John Lithgow. And I do like the interwoven fairytale creatures, especially the Gingerbread man whose ""torture"" is a hilariously funny scene. And Shrek himself is a truly likeable fellow even if he is somewhat of a slob. The animation is amazing! The best part is the rescue of the princess with it's firebreathing dragon and all (also a funny scene). The ending ,with the escape from the dragon's clutches, is pure ""James Bond meets Indiana Jones"" with a score to match and even the use of slow-motion! A delightful mix of suspense and humour! My only, minor, complaint is that the movie is too short!! But you do get a bonus after the feature to treasure :-) A MUST-SEE for children of all ages!!!!!!"
658,Shrek,5,14 December 2002,Cute Story & Characters we can care about! 4.5 Stars,"Like ""Ice Age"" I found myself watching and watching this new animated epic which quickly became a favorite of our family, children and adults alike. For some reason my wife thought this film might be too ""something"" for our youngest [age 3] to enjoy appropriately but like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", the adult jokes go over the toddlers heads without so much as an expectant look. Part of what makes this film so good is the way it lampoons the usual cliches. Somehow in the process Shrek seems to avoid those overdone tired cliches by suspending our disbelief and redefining the genre in a way we may not have expected [for a change] and moving the power of the story up a notch, keeping pace with the soaring technologies and budgets now available to bring these epics to us, the audience. Also, like ""Ice-Age"", the plot really moves cleanly and concisely along and does not get caught up in song. Disney can make the songs work for the plot, but who else can have us humming ""The Bare Necessities,"" 35 years after it was released in ""The Jungle Book"" by a singing Bear? In Shrek the ending is satisfying though it would be much like ""Beauty and the Beast"" ending with Belle becoming a beast too! Yes, you'll just have to see it and we'll all have to see the sequel coming out in 2004 and hopefully it will be a sequel to match Toy Story 2, minus the music of course."
659,Shrek,10,28 November 2002,"A Film I expected to hate, but is one of the best films ever!","This is one of the best films, ever! Ya gotta understand, with all the media-marketing hype and the terms ""family oriented"" and ""Kids Film"" I grew to dislike this film, without seeing it. That was until I saw it all the way through for the first time on cable tv. Lesson learned: ignore the hype, view for yourself, make up your own mind.That's when I found out, this is a wonderful film for children, families and adults. Smart, witty and funny, a brilliant re-tread of fairy tales that will live on for a long time, to be included with all those ""other"" well-known timeless fairy tales.Shrek the Ogre, as voiced by Mike Myers was wonderful. He had all the elements, kids like. He's gross, he's loud, he's green and ugly. But he also possessed many traits adults liked, he was valiant and he had a heart. Everything a movie hero is made up of!I'm with everyone here as I cannot stop loving Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy. He should have won an Oscar for this. His vocal comedic stylings with this animation was brilliant, you cannot help but love Donkey.Princess Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz, was also wonderful and who could forget, Lord Farquaad voiced by the ever talented John Lithgow. I cannot tell you how hard I laughed throughout this film...and I loved the ending...I loved the ""twist"" of Princes Fiona and how, at least in this telling of the beautiful Princess fairy-tale story, beauty and love is in the eyes of the beholder.This film is a Dreamworks animation division triumph. Mr. Katzenberg out did himself in producing this one, an excellent choice and project well done. The Animation was superb. For those who don't believe me, take a look at ""Donkey"" during the film, or Lord Farquaad's hair for example. This type of Computer Animation is so ""scary"", you just KNOW real actors now have a ""shelf life"" and in the coming decades, this technology will advance and become a Hollywood norm. Good or bad as this ""shelf life"" for real actors may be, I am just commenting on what a great accomplishment, great entertainment and I hope as the technology progresses, it is used ""with"" and not ""instead of.""Anyone who hates this film, in my humble view, has a personal problem with it..because as far as an achievement, it is a great one, it is a spectacular film for all audiences -- loaded with adult jokes but in keeping it in line for children, which keeps everyone interested and very much entertained. Bravo!"
660,Shrek,10,27 November 2002,One of the best ever,"This movie offered nearly everything anyone could hope for.  It had the much disliked villain, the damsel who was a tomboy and needed to give direction to get the work done.  The work of Eddie Murphy and Michael Meyers is superb.  Everyone would have loved to have a pet like the donkey, but for the less than sociable Ogre.  He lived truly up to the character who dreaded the meetings with anyone but himself, but yet fell in love!  There was so much cuteness in this movie: the gingerbread man, the dating game, the talking mirror, the donkey, the dragon even had its tender side.  The writing is superb, even giving the characters a chance at directing the show.  This movie sets the barometer for any animated movie that will reach ""all"" ages.  I've never seen anything animated that is as appealing to all ages.  Can't wait for the second movie.  Rock on."
661,Shrek,10,18 November 2002,Quite Possibly The Best Animated Movie of It's Time...,"Shrek had everything, humor, adventure, romance, and it was also good for all ages. Little kids could enjoy this along with teens and      s. Some of the humor was above the younger viewers head and the      s found these parts funny. Shrek (while many aren't) was a good animated film, and you don't find a lot of good animated movies. Classics like this come once every couple of years. (Some animated classics include Beauty and the Beast and Monsters Inc.)     The only thing I have against Shrek is the fact they are making a sequel. The first one was very, very good, but many movies that were good the sequels... well they sucked. This does not happen in all cases though. Some (i.e. Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams and The Godfather 2) pulled of a box office hit sequel.     If you have never seen this movie you should check it out. I give it a whole hearted 9.5/10!"
662,Shrek,10,9 November 2002,One of a kind - Excellent,"I'm not big fan of Disney type movies. So I avoided going to see this thinking that it was just an over rated kids movie with good animation. Well the cast and script couldn't have been any better.  This movie is simply a gem.  If you have any doubt look at the cast of voices ... Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz.  I never realized the overall significance of the script or voices in a movie.  Obviously the animation is state of the art, but the voice acting credits here can't be overlooked.  So when you combine it all you create a true classic for the ages.  I know they will be doing a sequel, but this is going to be hard to top or even equal. This one is worth watching several times. I can't imagine any one not finding this film entertaining."
663,Shrek,,5 November 2002,Excellent!,"This film set out to make fun of just about every sappy ultra-Disneyfied children's movie that has  ever been made, and it blows them out of the park! From the main character being deliberately  different from the usual sword-wielding dunderhead to the villain being a very short noble with both an inferiority complex and a colossal ego, this film is its most appealing, simply because the hero  and heroine are such unlikely people! I won't give anything more than this away, by all means - watch  the film! :-)"
664,Shrek,9,2 November 2002,"One of the top 5 movies of 2001, an instant classic!","Shrek shook the world as an instant classic for young and old.  Breaching the top 5 best movie list of 2001 came this animated comedy- who knew?  The jokes were so well written and the movie has a hidden message about love that hopefully everyone caught while enjoying this new classic of the 21st century. A, **** out of ****, 9/10"
665,Shrek,7,30 October 2002,Wonderful movie,"I've watched this movie several times now and one thing I can say is that it is wonderful.  The voice casting was well done, the comedic timing nearly perfect, and the animation wonderful.  This movie had me laughing almost all the way through it.  Who says you can't poke a little fun at the established fairy tales and get away with it?  This definitely does and has some good lessons that do NOT come away as preaching.  On the pywrit scale of 1-10, this one gets an 8."
666,Shrek,10,28 October 2002,BRILLIANT MOVIE!!,"Before I had actually gone to see the film I thought it was just going to be one more of those garbage animation movies.  When I FINALLY rented it and watched it, my eyes were popping out of my head.  It was a way better movie than I thought it was going to be.  The plot was boring, yet the graphics and sound and comediac theatrics were perfect.  Personally, I give this movie a 10/10 due to the fact that the producers truly did put all that they had into this movie."
667,Shrek,9,19 October 2002,Well I'll be Shreked!,I went into this movie thinking it was going to be horrible. I hadnt watched a children's movie in so long I had almost forgotten they were good. I bought this movie and it had me laughing and hooked all the way to the end. It has a very good plot and holds through on most storybook happy endings. I recommend this to children and adults.
668,Shrek,,17 October 2002,Original and smart!,"Disney has often followed on a set of ""guidelines"" to making all of their films work: a beautiful princess in some kind of peril (ie: Sleeping Beauty is under a spell to make her sleep, Snow White ate the poisoned apple, Cinderella wants to go the ball, etc.).  These films often work on some level, but originality is often lacking in fairy tales, which always come from some source.  Plus, they teach lessons that don't exactly behoove the viewer, often the impressionable young child (lessons in infatuation--what fairy tale didn't have some prince with a superiority complex wanting to be king, and spotting a beautiful girl from across the room, and saying ""She's the one.""????  You NEVER see Prince Wonderful courting Lovely Lady around, do you?  Ok, ok, I'll get off my soapbox now.  ""Shrek"" completely goes against the grain in terms of fairy tale concepts by adding a whole new twist to the genre, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is an ugly green ogre living in a ramshackle house in the swamp by himself, without a care in the world.  When Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) banishes all ""fairy tale creatures"" from the land, Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy), who talks too much, escapes from his owner and the clutches of the people who are taking him away, and goes to Shrek's swamp and begs Shrek to take him in, and Shrek unwillingly does just that.  When all the fairy tale creatures are dumped on his property, Shrek complains to Farquaad. Farquaad, a diminuitive lord with a superiority complex, wants to be king, and after consulting his magic mirror, he sees the woman he would like to have for his bride, and tells Shrek that he will remove the fairy tale creatures from his property if Shrek can bring him his future bride, Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz).This movie is probably one of the funniest animated movies I've seen in a long time.  I'm a Disney fan, but I've strayed from their ""fairy tale"" pictures due to a lack of interest, and have geared my interest to different (and original) animated stories.  This one is truly original in every way, even though it recycles familiar fairy tale characters (the 7 dwarfs, Pinochio, Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, etc), but in a humorous way.  The actors themselves (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow) are great in their parts, and the supporting voices and characters are what makes this film great.  There are so many inside jokes that this movie would tend to fly right over a child's head.  there are also alot of sight gags that the viewer would easily miss the first time around.I don't have one absolute favorite scene, because this whole movie was hysterically funny and smart.  However, some of them stand out in mind. The ""gingerbread man"" was classic, with the famous cookie lying on a cookie pan, legs broken off, with a glass of milk next to him.  His ""tourture"" was getting dipped in the milk and the threat of his buttons getting ripped off. When Farquaad tells him to confess, Gingerbread Man screams ""Eat me!"" and spits.  Another great scene was the ""Merry Men"" singing their song, which turns into the suspended-motion scene from ""The Matrix"" with Fiona lifting into the air in the ""karate-kick"" motion, the action freezes, the angle rotates, and Fiona kicks two Merry Men at the same time.  The part with the magic mirror was also hillarious.  I like how the mirror was honest with Farquaad, informing him that ""he really wasn't a king, and this isn't a kingdom,"" to which Farquaad gestures to Thelonious as to what happens to a ""lying"" mirror (Thelonious punches a small handheld mirror), and the mirror counteracts ""...but you can be king,"" and shows three different women, ""Dating Game"" style.  The scene at Farquaad's amusement park was hillarious, especially with the ""It's a Small World""-esque puppets singing.This was a great film, complete with a great cast, and is a fun story. This definitely breaks all those rules that fairy tales tend to set (and believe me, rules were made to be broken).  I am anxiously awaiting the sequel in 2004, and highly recommend this to everyone and their 5th cousin once removed (LOL!  just kidding). This is a great story of romance and wonder, and it is sure to be a hit for years to come.Donkey: Hi, Princess. Fiona: It talks! Shrek: Yeah, it's getting him to shutup that's the trick!Ok, maybe I'll take this as advice.  See ""Shrek,"" you won't regret it!!"
669,Shrek,10,5 October 2002,"Excellent Film, All Around Great!!!","I loved everything about this film!  The animation alone is worth watching! I read a few other reviews on this site and a few of them said that they weren't impressed with the animation?  Are you serious?  What is wrong with you?  This animation is absolutely mind-boggling!  I think people that say they aren't impressed with the animation are people that have NO idea how much time, effort and work it takes to create just a single frame of this film (although, I'm no expert either, but I can at least imagine how hard it is).  Anyhow, don't listen to these people, the animation is excellent!!!The voice-acting is great on all accounts.  Mike Myers does a great Shrek, Cameron Diaz plays the perfect Princess Fiona, John Lithgow is awesome as Prince Farquaad, and Eddie Murphy completely steals the show as Donkey.  It really pains me to read other reviews and read that they didn't think the film was funny?  I don't know what to say to these people, I thought the film was hilarious!!!  Just different tastes I guess.I think this in one of the few films these days that can be enjoyed both by younger kids and adults, there's a lot of good stuff to this film.  I thought this film was excellent and can't wait for a sequel (hope it's good though).  I hope you enjoy the film when you see it, and you will!  Thanks for reading,-Chris"
670,Shrek,,30 September 2002,Crying from laughter. Very funny animation and movie.,"Shrek is what you would NOT call your average romance comedy. You would call it an above average, with some hilarious lines and scenes in it. I really do enjoy this. As Mike Myers voices Shrek, Eddie Murphy voices the donkey, Cameron Diaz voices the Princess Fiona, and John Lithgo voices Lord Farquad. A delight. 10 out of 10!"
671,Shrek,9,13 September 2002,HILARIOUS!!!!,This movie is AWESOME!!!! It's very funny and it has something for the whole family. In fact this movie reminds me of Animaniacs because like that show this is a movie where the parent and the child laugh at the same scene for two different reasons. 4(****)out of 4(****)stars
672,Shrek,8,11 September 2002,Possibly the best computer-gen. film ever!,"When Steven Speilberg took on the co-ownership of Dreamworks, I bet he never thought that he was going to have some of his biggest success using Mike Meyers (voice of Shrek), Eddie Murphy (voice of Donkey), Cameron Diaz (voice of the Princess), and John Lithgow (voice of Farquad).  Not that that matters much because if this movie didn't get you laughing till your gut hurt...than you must be a corpse!  I don't think any of us would have thought that the four of these talented stars could make us laugh if put into a sound studio together!"
673,Shrek,8,29 August 2002,Brilliant,"This was an excellent take on an old fairytale. The animation was superb and the performances were excellent, especially from Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Mike Myers was also good but I was baffled as to why he had made Shrek Scottish! There were so many sequences in this film that made even the hardest nosed adult laugh, none more so than the Rip-off of the Matrix and the karaoke sequence at the end. Very funny."
674,Shrek,10,17 August 2002,Excellent movie for any audience young or old,"I have now watched this film with family and friends, aged ranging from 2 to 75, even at the same time, and all enjoyed!  Extremely well written, with quite witty dialogue and absolutely excellent graphics and story line.  If only all ""kid movies"" could be this rich in quality.  Everyone would watch them!"
675,Shrek,,11 August 2002,HILARIOUS MOVIE!,"*May contain spoilers*Watch this movie. It's awesome. It's funny. Need I say more?I watched it in theaters with my sister, and I couldn't stop laughing. Although, I don't enjoy fart jokes as much as most people, it was still an awesome movie. I've rented it so many times, and I never, NEVER will get sick of this movie.I've always thought that Disney was the best movie-maker ever, but when I sae this, my thoughts proved me wrong. Eddie Murphy is a HILARIOUS actor and was perfect for the part of donkey.When I saw trailers for this, I thought, ""Yeah, this is a kids movie, FOR SURE!"" But when my sister took me to see, I was proved wrong, yet AGAIN! Like Dreamworks other movie, ""Antz"", this movie is good for the whole family.I laughed so hard at Lord Farquad, and how *ahem* let's us use the term small in height he was! The jokes are hilarious and please, please, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!! If you don't, I'll shoot you ;)This movie deserves an 11/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
676,Shrek,,7 August 2002,"Remind me what's so good about this movie, please.","I do not see what makes this movie so special. It's stupid and, truthfully, disgusting... but then again I wouldn't think anything more when the main character's voice is Mike Myers. I really want to know what people see in this movie. It's pointless! Am I the only one how thinks this movie should, well, jump a cliff without a parachute. It's not funny, it just tries to be! If anything, I say this movie doesn't deserve half of the ratings it gets. This movies OKAY for a, what? Seven-year-old? Yes, that sounds about right. Maybe and eight-year-old too. Let me just say, I would rather suggest ""Barney"" then this movie... and don't make me get started on ""Barney"" also!!!"
677,Shrek,8,11 August 2002,Another great movie for both kids and adults,"Shrek is one of those kids´ movies that adults are sure to enjoy as well. Many of my friends (I´m 19) saw Shrek before me and they all said it´s very good. Now I finally decided to rent the film and watch it myself. I´m glad I did. The movie´s hilarious! Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy, is the best character and he´s sure to make you laugh. Another great character is Lord Farquaad, played by one of my favorite actors, John Lithgow. He is such a fantastic performer, just watch The 3rd Rock From The Sun and you´ll know what I mean.       It´s no wonder that Shrek became a massive box office hit all over the world. Disney´s not the only studio that can produce good-quality family entertainment. Ice Age is another proof of that (I´ve only seen the trailer, but what a trailer that is!). Shrek actually pokes fun at many familiar Disney figures, but it´s not like Jeffrey Katzenberg is mocking them. I guess he just wanted to show his old pals at Disney that there´s a new player in the game and that´s DreakWorks & Co. Shrek, one of the best family movies out there, gets 8 out of 10."
678,Shrek,,23 May 2002,A New Spin on the Fairy Tale.,"Visually stunning and technically impressive, but somewhat over-rated animated flick that makes fun of itself way too often. The princess is to be rescued by an ogre and a wise-cracking donkey after being forced to by an evil king who has kicked all fairy tale creatures out of their land. But she does have a secret that few could have guessed and the film tries to warm the heart during its final act, but by that time it was nearly too late. ""Shrek"" is one of those odd films that uses smoke and mirrors to make it seem a lot better than it really is. It is a good film, but to me it was much weaker than recent Disney films that have used similar animation techniques (""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""A Bug's Life""). Its story-telling is a bit out-there and that is the main problem I had with the film. It is also more adult-oriented as many children will not understand the gags and many adults will be turned off by some of the situations and dialogue. ""Shrek"" is historical as it is the very first winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar, but in time ""Shrek"" could be more of a curiosity than a classic. 4 stars out of 5."
679,Shrek,8,20 May 2001,Fascinating and amusing summer fare,"Shrek is the 2nd animated film from the PDI/Dreamworks team which before brought the public Antz.  While that was directed towards adults, now we have this- Shrek (by the way, a little inside joke is that Shrek is yiddish for fright).  A new comedy for kids and adults.  And surprisingly, it works for both.While the film brings a unconventional (with a conventional formula) story in the mix, it's best parts are with the animation skills by the people at PDI, but also with the voice talents: Myers brings a keen type of Fat Bastard voice in Shrek (some lines also sound like they came from Austin Powers movies); Murphy shows that if he starts to run out of good movies, he can always go to voice overs; Lithgow has not been this good in years and Diaz may be annoying at times but is cute throughout.  As is the film which is so far the most workable (as I would call it such) in the summer regime and my first real recommendation for this season.  A"
680,Shrek,10,27 August 2003,Animation will never be the same.,"Animation has taken some great leaps in recent years. Because ofthe Simpsons, it has become more popular and taken moreseriously as ""more than kids' stuff"" because of computertechnology, it has become quality art instead of just flippingpost-its. Shrek was a very groundbreaking film in 2001. Because of it'sengaging storyline, beautiful plot, funny, multi-faceted charactarsand impressive animation, it finally broke the barrier that animationwas not just cartoons and thin plots, but that it could be takenseriously in a movie, so seriously in fact that because of Shrek, theBest Animated Film Oscar category was created. I love Shrek. It's my favourite movie. I've defenitely seen betterfilms, but Shrek remains number # 1 with me. I can't wait for thesequel!"
681,Shrek,4,20 May 2001,"Good storytelling, lousy story","Any movie that needed to have it's own brand of Baskin Robbins ice cream is not likely to be selling itself on it's own merits.  Despite all the time and money that was spent on Shrek, it fell far short of the accomplishment it could have been.In its technical aspects Shrek excelled.  The animation is fluid and precise.  Shrek's human characters are animated well enough to make Toy Story look primitive.  The donkey is particularly impressive. Rarely has an animated creature been so emotionally expressive with it's entire body.  The movie obviously had good storyboarding.  Each scene portrays the subjects with skill and style.  Shrek's fairytale world is a visual delight.  From the impressive sunsets to the lively forest, and from the dazzling stained glass windows of Farquaad's fortress to the swirling lava and foreboding decay of the dragon's castle, Shrek's colorful environment is fascinating to watch.In contrast, the script is largely a disappointment.  To be sure, Shrek does have its funny moments.  There is a notably amusing and well deserved mockery of Disneyland as Shrek and his donkey companion enter Farquaad's town.  However, the majority of the jokes fail miserably. Shrek has a decidedly unamusing preoccupation with fart jokes.  Much of the humor of the movie seems to rest on the curious assumption that potty talk and other crudeness are inherently funny.All four of the main characters display startling inconsistency. Shrek is ferociously fearless in tackling a pitchfork-wielding mob, a fire-breathing dragon and small army of armor-clad knights.  However, in the midst of this he also quickly gives in to Farquaad's requests and is easily intimidated by an angry Princess Fiona.  The Princess wavers between a helpless damsel being carried around by Shrek, and karate trained superwoman who can single-handedly defeat a band of thieves. The dragon repeatedly switches between trying to kill the main characters and being friendly to them with little or no explanation.  The donkey shows, perhaps, the most consistency with his unceasing, mindless chatter.  Eddie Murphy, as the donkey, does an excellent job of being as annoying as possible.  Mike Meyers brings a measure of balance to the Shrek character despite Meyers's well done, but out of place, Scottish accent.
At several points the dialog breaks down into pure tackiness. The relationship tension between Shrek and Fiona, spawned from a hackneyed misunderstanding, is fit only for a bad soap opera.  Much of the dialog has a childish feel despite the PG-13 rating that was earned by the occasional use of obscenities.  The discussions among the characters become, at times, blatantly preachy. The banal presentation of such moral lessons as ""don't judge by appearances"" is reminiscent of didactic Saturday morning cartoons.The plot is plain and predictable, but suffers the most from its tendency to gloss over poorly explained points.  Add to the triteness of the plot top 40 tunes to accompany it, WWF style combat, and a Matrix reference and Shrek can be seen for what it really is: just another conglomeration of pop-culture entertainment ideas.  While pretending to be a new and different perspective on fairy tales, Shrek has nothing to offer but overdone, worn-out themes."
682,Shrek,8,13 March 2003,So far the best animated film I have ever viewed,"Shrek is a great tale that follows an ogre named Shrek and a donkey, that won't shut up, named Donkey and their adventure to save a Princess in a castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. When they find the castle the fire-breathing dragon turns out to be a female and falls in love with Donkey. They rescue the Princess and then they head to a village called Duloc to deliver the Princess to Lord Farquaad. He is the one that sends Shrek on this journey to rescue the Princess, so he can marry her to become a King. Shrek interrupts the wedding of Lord Farquaad and Princess Fiona because he loves the Princess. Princess Fiona awaits a kiss from Shrek so a curse that was put on her by a witch would be lifted from her. The curse turns her in to an ogre every time the sunsets and the only way to lift the curse is to have true loves first kiss. But she stays an ogre to show children that true beauty comes from within. Shrek and Princess Fiona get married. Lord Farquaad is eating by the fire-breathing dragon, and she falls in love with Donkey, and vise versa. Everything is great in the end. The animation for Shrek is fantastic. No other animated film that I have viewed is as good or better. Ice Age, Toy Story 1&2, and Monster's Inc. are very fine animated films, but not Shrek quality. The film is also funny for kids and adults. A lot of little comments in Shrek that is meant for adults, that little kids won't get. The animation along with the story is why I give Shrek * * * ½ {out of 4 stars} & a 8/10."
683,Shrek,7,16 July 2001,Applaud its intentions and ambition.,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 'Shrek' in its tagline calls itself 'the greatest fairytale never told'. This is because it's not really a fairy tale at all.  We first see Shrek in a makeshift doubleyewcee reading a conventional fairy-tale.  The latter is set up as something archaic, sappy and nothing to do with a real-world represented by the 'modern' music that introduces Shrek and his irreverent attitudes.We are expected to laugh with him at old-fashioned fairy tales. Throughout the fairy tale rules are overturned - the ogre gets the girl; the beautiful princess turns out to be, er, less conventionally attractive; the dragon metamorphoses from fierce Godzilla to cuddly love-struck Gadzuki.  But by destroying the fairy-tale archetypes, 'Shrek' destroys the resonance of the fairy-tale, and its p.c. finale, while very moving (I welled up at least four times during 'Shrek'; so much for anti-Disney) does not make an impact because it's not true to a 'poetic' truth that reflects real life.  A smelly ogre is not going to cadge a rich babe because she fortuitously turns into a smelly ogre herself - the rich, young and pretty tend to stick together.
The conventional fairy tale Shrek and the implied audience mock actually has powerful stuff the film ignores - the virginal princess seeking a first kiss that will rescue her from a dragon guarding a castle.  These things - princesses, kisses, castles, dragons are powerful, age-old metaphors for sexuality, patriarchy, socialisation etc.  By undercutting their symbolic function, Shrek undercuts the reason they were so potent for so long in the first place.  I am not saying Shrek should pay obeisance to the altar of the fairy tale, but the likes of Angela Carter and Jan Svankmajer have shown what is possible when you explore fairy tales and their dark undercurrents, especially sexual (most of Perrault's fairy tales were instructive morality, sexuality and socialising tales for young girls).This is not to deny the genuine pleasure offered by the film, just to suggest why it didn't plumb my depths like the best Disney (who, like a certain soft drink, seem to have a special formula that is inimitable and unmockable, little as we'd like to admit it).  The characters are lovely, and so is Mike Myers' Scottish accent.  John Lithgow, looking like a miniature Laurence Olivier playing Richard III is such a hoot it's a shame there isn't more of him (arf!).Individual scenes are priceless - Shrek's swamp as dumping ground for fairy tale refugees, a sequence full of irreverent (if dubious political) glee; the sublime Dimco sequence, revealing its source's charmless, totalitarian monumentality; the whole Robin Hood sequence, complete with French outlaw, wonderfully daft song (I wanted more songs!  Sorry) and unproariously funny 'Matrix' spoof.Visually, the film isn't the revelation I'd heard it was - maybe my local has a lousy screen, but I didn't see anything particularly amazing about the donkey's hairs, and the animation as a whole had the stiffness, as well as the charm, of old woodcuts.  There were some glorious exceptions - the sunlight dappling the forest as our heroes return home from the castle; the gorgeous moonlight vigil; the awesome dragon castle sequence, the only time the film gets to the Gothic terror of original fairy tales, with its rubble, noble skeletons and fast fireballs."
684,Shrek,5,9 July 2001,Call me an Ogre,"I am not sure I understand why this movie was so well received by critics. It is an ok movie, but there is not an original idea or even a coherent story. It relies almost entirely on references to other stories, movies and even companies (Disney), and the animation, while technically impressive,lacked any ""magic"" or true beauty.Also I was turned off by its blunt attempts at appealing to both kids and adults (with a sledgehammer approach) and the way overblown music.So call me an Ogre, but please don't make me watch this again..."
685,Shrek,10,13 December 2010,Sad Bird Scene,"In that bird scene, that actually made me cry! Earlier, I watched it and I started crying, especially when the bird exploded! Like, I started to get bits of tears in my eyes, and then when that bird exploded and died, I burst out crying!!! (starts crying)Poor bird! I loved him! Fiona shouldn't have sang that loud if she knew that was going to happen!Why did they even have the scene be like that?! They're such horrible people for doing that! I'm an animal lover, and I love animals no matter what!And when that bird started chirping to Fiona's singing, I started to cry a little bit too. Because it sounded so beautiful and touching; so beautiful that it softened my heart!WHY DID THEY HAVE THAT BIRD EXPLODE AND DIE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?WWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!R.I.P., Bluebird <:_("
686,Shrek,9,10 February 2016,Shrek Maybe Ugly But Here He Sparkles with Charm and Irreverence!,"Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green, obnoxious ogre who bathes (and gargles) in mud, is notoriously flatulent and makes a candle out of his earwax. He knows perfectly well he's not welcome in polite society and just wants is to be left alone in his swamp. But Shrek has a couple of problems. One is a stubborn, trash-talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has latched onto him and the other is the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow, subtly underplaying), who has dumped all the disenfranchised fairytale creatures of the land in Shrek's backyard. So the Seven Dwarfs hauling a dead Snow White around in her glass casket, the Three Bears, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf and a horde of other beloved Disney characters turn up in the swamp of our misanthropic ogre and spoil his view with their squalid refugee camp. Shrek cuts a deal with the nasty Lord to get his solitude back: Rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz, surprisingly amazing) from the castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon and his land will be cleared of the squatters. So the reluctant ogre goes on his quest, with the yammering Donkey at his side. They encounter the dragon, which has a soft spot for donkeys, and rescue Fiona so that she can marry Farquaad. Things then get complicated, and quite adorable, as Shrek finds a soft spot for the lady. But the Princess does not only have real chemistry with the ogre, but also a dark secret of her own.Some wise guys sure had a blast making Shrek. That's certain. You can feel the snap, crackle and the pop of creation here as talented animators take a classic story and twist it to make fun of both fairy tales and the Disney behemoth. No one has attempted to take the starch out of these beloved icons, never with such wicked glee. ""Though she lives with seven men, she's not easy!"" barks Shrek about Snow White while Cinderella is called ""a mentally abused shut-in""  with riotous irreverence, they lampoon every once-sacred characteristic of the nursery kingdom. Whether any of this is actionable is for the courts to decide. But in the court of public opinion, it's hilarious! You can almost picture the makers giggling as they come up with non-stop wisecracks, stopping only to groove on the computer images they've made. From the lush countryside that Shrek roams through, to the amazing, textured faces on each of its characters, Shrek is a stunning achievement. The animation is used subtly and intelligently, with great humor, never pushing things further than the technology will allow. Its musical scenes are unusually powerful, its wit remarkably vicious, its central love story genuinely touching.What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers. Shrek may be a mean, green halitosis machine, but it doesn't take long to love him, warts and all, thanks to Mike Myers who reprises his Scottish accent to great comic effect. Eddie Murphy steals every scene he's in with equal parts bounce and warmth as the yakky Donkey and practically gallops off with the movie.With improbable finesse, Shrek buffs up some of the oldest tropes of storytelling and then gives them a mischievous tilt, so that we appear to be watching a celebration of a genre and a sneaky subversion of it at the same time. It is an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication!"
687,Shrek,8,15 January 2016,One of DreamWork's Finest,"Shrek really speaks volumes to what DreamWorks can bring to the table as this is a very compelling comedy. Nowadays comedies have fallen flat and are rarely able to hit home instead of the foul zone. But Shrek and DreamWorks has such clever talent that the originality of the idea automatically makes this a one-of-a-kind comedy. Shrek would also begin DreamWorks' run as a real and legit animated film company. In fact legit is an understatement to what an impact this film has had on popular culture. As today it is regarded as one of there finest along with How to Train Your Dragon, and Kung Fu Panda. Shrek offers a mixture of laughter and satire, while also throwing in some drama and action. The voice talent is one thing DreamWorks knows how to do, and every single character is voiced by a major celebrity. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, and Cameron Diaz, heck even Larry King has a role in this. I was so excited to see the second film, but that's for another time. Now to grade. Animation: A- Voices: A Characters: A Comedy: A+ Music: B Overall: A"
688,Shrek,8,1 July 2015,Shrek And His Merry Men,"I watched this film recently with my sister as part of our Dreamworks Movie Marathon. Shrek is a great fantasy-adventure film. The characters have good arcs, the sets are great for a fantasy film, and the movie does an excellent job at building the world surrounding our main characters. This is seen through the small details of the minor characters (the fairy tale creatures), and the Robin Hood scene in which characters are introduced and never mentioned again. World- building. The friendship between Shrek and Donkey grows very well, and is the high point of the film. I definitely must say this movie may entertain kids, but the script leans heavily toward innuendo and is clearly directed at an adult audience. This is not at all a detriment, it gives the movie the grit it needed to be a successful action/adventure film."
689,Shrek,8,5 June 2015,Original Fairy Tale.,"Shrek (2001): Dir: Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson / Voices: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow, Vincent Cassel: Computer generated pleasure that violates all of those fairy tale clichés that we grew up with. Shrek is an ogre secluded in the woods who scares anyone who disrupts his life. Lord Farquaad could become King but only if he has a Princess. He sets his sights on Princess Fiona who is secluded in a castle guarded by a dragon. Shrek accepts the task in order that all the fairy tale characters that have landed on his property be rid of. Conclusion is questionable depending on one's preference towards Fiona. Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson have familiarized themselves with the clichés and exploit them. Mike Myers voices Shrek who dislikes human contact but takes upon this task in hopes to regain his privacy. Eddie Murphy brings hilarity to Donkey whom Shrek saves. Donkey will become involved in a twisted relationship by the conclusion. Cameron Diaz is hilarious as Fiona whose personality is feisty but she conceals a secret. John Lithgow voices tyrant Farquaad, a little man attempting to conquer big things such as torturing the Gingerbread Man. Vincent Cassel voices a French version of Robin Hood, which should impress upon the legacy of Errol Flynn. Wonderful and original images make for a laugh-filled adventure that exposes all others. Score: 8 / 10"
690,Shrek,10,23 May 2015,One of the greatest animated movies ever made,"I hadn't watched this movie for a while,I re-watched it a couple of weeks ago actually and when I did, oh boy, it was excellent, the animation might not be the best (Monsters Inc for example, Ice Age as well) because it's before them actually but the story was unpredictable and heartwarming at times.The characters and their voices are great, Mike Myers as Shrek somewhat gives him that ogre touch,Eddie Murphy as Donkey is very funny, Cameron Diaz as Fiona sounds perfect and John Lithglow as Lord Farquaad is pretty good and Lithglow's voice fit him.Overall, Shrek is an excellent and perfect animated movie that hit all the right notes and instantly becomes a classic"
691,Shrek,9,15 December 2012,I think I'm actually a believer in this classic from my childhood,"Looking back at my childhood when I watched Dreamworks Animation's traditional animated films like ""The Road to El Dorado"" and ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"", I usually remember watching this in theaters and officially loved it ever since. The reason why I'm giving this a point below a 10 is because while Lord Farquaad is a likable villain, he isn't the best non-Disney villain like most out there, but that doesn't matter.All you need is a nice and original story to make it memorable to watch. Successfully portrayed as an epic tale of pop culture references about a lovable green ogre who befriends a loud-mouth donkey on their quest to rescue a princess from a deadly dragon in a castle, this movie has captivated my heart for as long as I can remember.The animation is beautiful and colorful with some nice detailed backgrounds on the castles, the forests and such along with terrific character animation. The characters are likable especially Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and others and thanks to a great voice cast like Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow, they made me not to forget them. The music from John Powell and Harry Gregson Williams is poignant with some moments that have emotion especially it's great action cues (Escape from the Dragon, for example). Some of the humor is great too and never, and I mean, never have I stop laughing at every single one of them.Overall, Shrek came near to become a classic, but is by any means an epic CGI film that will always be watched again & again to either make you laugh or cry. It will always be *this* good."
692,Shrek,9,20 March 2011,The perfect un-fairy tale fairy tale,"Shrek is truly a movie that stands alone. If you've never seen the film, take every fairy tale you heard growing up, throw it into a pot, add a large amount of humor, some adult innuendos, a fabulous cast of characters with the perfect voices, and you get a movie adults and children alike will love. The movie is a giant parody of many fairy tales centering on the gruff, but oh so lovable ogre Shrek (Mike Myers). In order to keep his swamp and end the harassment by the larger-than-life ego and personality of pint-sized ruler, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), Shrek must save Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon guarded castle.There are so many subtle themes running through the film that although laced with sometime raunchy humor can still teach impressive stories to the viewer. One of the strongest themes was that not everything is what it seems. Stereotypes are so misguided, even in the mythical, magical world of this silly un-fairy tale. Love being blind is also another theme throughout the film.While on his quest to end the harassment from Farquaad and other humans, Shrek meets many interesting characters. Most notably, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) enters Shrek's life as an annoyance, but ends up becoming a true best friend. Together, Shrek and Donkey trek to the castle and along the way face trials and tribulations that expose how unfair and untrue many stereotypes can be. Shrek as an ogre is supposed to a horrible, killing machine, but in all reality he is just an ogre who wants to live in peace in his swamp. He doesn't like to use his ogre traits because he doesn't want to be seen as exactly what people ""think"" he is. Donkey has seen a life of hardship; however he keeps an upbeat and happy perspective about life. His personality perfectly opposes Shrek's and together their antics make for a hilarious adventure.Princess Fiona again proves that not everyone or everything is as they seem and is a true testament to inner beauty being more powerful than outer beauty. After being rescued by Shrek and Donkey, the three set off back to Duloc and face interesting challenges that help each realize that there is more to each character than what they originally perceived. Through these travels Shrek and Fiona overcome the odds and find that true love doesn't always come in the form we're shown in fairy tales. Much like other animated films, such as How to Train Your Pet Dragon, the characters learn to be their true selves and follow their hearts.The lighting and setting in the movie provide an amazing backdrop for such a hilarious, action-packed film. There is so much detail to each setting in the film from Shrek's swamp to Duloc to the castle Princess Fiona is locked away in. The film truly looks like real life turned into animation, with the same attention to detail as Disney's Finding Nemo. The lighting brings to life not only the vibrant colors, but each scene. Younger viewers get a sense of whether the story is taking a dangerous or lighthearted turn through the use of lighting and shadows. Despite being the home of an ogre, Shrek's swamp is bright and full of life, proving that the ogre living there isn't a cruel, human-killer. The colors in the film are also visually stunning. Shrek and Fiona's green have become a favorite of mine.Shrek is a very fun, lighthearted animated movie that still serves to take on themes about being oneself in a world full of stereotypes and preconceived notions. We all learn that it's okay to let our inner ogre shine."
693,Shrek,10,20 August 2009,The best in the series.,"Shrek is one of the best animation films i've ever seen. It's incredibly inventive and has great humor and great performances. Mike Myers is great as the ogre Shrek. If it wouldn't of had his name on the front cover I never would've known it was him. Eddie Murphy is fantastic as Donkey. Donkey is the highlight of the film, pretty much. Donkey is the best character in the entire trilogy, no character can top Donkey. There's also Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, who I liked also. The last person is John Lithgow from 3rd rock from the sun. Lithgow is great in this also. With such a great cast, great cast, clever comedy, and many other things, Shrek is one of the best animation films ever. It's second place behind Ratatouille and tied with Finding Nemo. This is definitely Dreamwork's best film. Usually, films from Dreamworks that are nominated for best animated film don't win. Pixar is usually the Oscar winning one. But Shrek actually did win best animated picture, because it's fantastic. It definitely deserved it.The Plot: Shrek is a big green ogre who is hated by everyone and just wants peace and quiet. But his life changes when all of these fairy tale creatures are found on his swamp. So to get rid of them, Shrek goes to Lord Farquad and begins his quest to find Princess Fiona, who Farquad wants to marry so then he can be King. But Princess Fiona isn't quite what he expects."
694,Shrek,10,12 December 2005,Rollicking Family Entertainment,"""Shrek"" is even better rollicking family animation fun than ""Chicken Run"" released earlier in the year.I loved not only the satirical references to Disney movies, but to Disneyland itself, as well as to other classic movies like ""Wizard of Oz,"" all sly jokes to entertain the adults on top of the jokes the kids will get. Did the plot point of an evil chief of state banishing the fairy tale creatures have to do with Disney no longer using fairy tales as animation inspiration? The voice overs are terrific, Mike Myers with a Scottish burr, John Lithgow as a delicious villain (even if the short stature jokes run counter to the love people despite how they look theme), and especially Eddie Murphy who even tops his sidekick role in ""Mulan"" for his jackass here.Perhaps this was another dig at Disney, but there was no original music, instead clever covers, including a surprising use of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" as done by John Cale, originally from the Leonard Cohen tribute album ""I'm Your Fan"" (though it's Rufus Wainwright on the soundtrack CD), and the Proclaimers as a Scottish touch (though not ""500 Miles"" oddly enough though it would have fit the particular scene better). The finale cover of ""I'm a Believer"" practically drove me out to the record store to pick up the CD, which I did a week later. I even stayed for a second showing to see the finale again, as my son had recommended seeing it twice.(originally written 6/15/2001)"
695,Shrek,9,10 December 2005,I love this movie because its so funny.,"Shreks voice really goes with his image,so does donkeys and all the rest of the casts. I like the this movies genres which are adventure/animation/comedy family/romance/fantasy. This is the first movie I know that has won 28 awards.Shrek is an ogre who has to find Princess Fiona for Farquaad who wants to be a king.The reason that Shrek obeys this command is because Farquaad is a very senior man.With the help of his friend a,an annoying donkey Shrek sets out to look for Princess Fiona who is cursed because of her beauty.Her curse is that after the sun sets in the sky she turns into an ogre like Shrek and Shrek marries her when he finds out about her being an ogre and she makes herself turn into an ogre forever."
696,Shrek,10,21 September 2005,A modern animated parable:too good to be true,"Wow! Shrek won't let you stop laughing/crying. This is a movie that never gives you a single slack moment, interspersing the absurdly hilarious with the deeply touching.Eddie Murphy is, well, Eddie Murphy, as brilliant as ever. If you see the talking donkey, you will wonder if it's actually Eddie Murphy acting in a suit. I believe the donkey (who is referred to throughout the movie as simply Donkey) is the greatest animated character in History, even considering Disney.The ending, though perhaps a tad bit allegorical, delivers a moral well suited to and much needed in modern times. I will not give it away, except to say that it is a message that traditional fables never express, usually contradict.The original music score is sheer brilliance, for example ""Halla Louia"". The quality of animation, keeping true to DreamWorks standards, is excellent.Overall, It's one of the greatest animations of all time, in the same rank as classics such as Fantasia, Beauty and the Beast etc. I'm surprised to see it rated lower than Finding Nemo."
697,Shrek,8,7 February 2005,Beautiful and funny,"My view on animated film is rather divided i would say. I don't have anything against the media although i find the movies are often not very enjoyable. This has changed a bit with Pixars movies, and of course this one.Shrek is an ogre living in a swamp. Suddenly his wonderfully desolate swamp gets filled with fairy-tale creatures though. It seems that the prince who runs the land has decided to rid it of all fairy-tale creatures. So now they have come to hide in Shreks swamp, disturbing his peace. Shrek goes to the prince to complain, and ends up being sent away on an important mission.The first thing that strikes me about this movie is how wonderfully animated it is. It's simply stunning! The animation technique here seems to be focused more on realism than the one used in Pixars movies. This gives Shrek a more textured look, almost like you could touch the characters with your hand.The second thing that strikes me is the wonderful sense of humor. Seldom has an animated movie been done with such exquisite feeling for what's funny and what's not. Also they have managed to make this extremely enjoying both for adults and children. Pixars movies are good but i always felt they were more directed at children, this however contains enough nods to things an adult understands more than a child, which make it fun for the whole family.In short, i found this movie to be wonderful. The sense of humor, the stylish look, the funny characters, the nods to fairy tales and the world that has been created. All this combined make this one of the most entertaining movies in it's genre. I rate it 8/10."
698,Shrek,9,2 February 2005,A splendidly creative spoof on old fairy tales and recent movies,"Shrek is one of those movies that looks like just another kids' movie, but is really intended for adults. Shrek has a great cast including Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as the donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as Lord Farquad. Shrek has very stunning animation, brilliant humor(even some humor for adults that kids won't pick up on), and an involving storyline. Everything about Shrek is some kind of reference to a fairy tale, but there's also plenty of references to modern day movies that anyone could pick up on. Shrek was a great break through in animated movies.(Spoilers) The story follows an ogre who seems happy with his life, but is really a lonely spirit and is in need of someone to be with him. One day he befriends a chatterbox donkey, who won't leave him alone. That night, a bunch of fairy tale creatures also show up in Shrek's swamp seeking a home and a place to stay, because the evil Lord Farquad forced them there. Shrek goes on a trip to Lord Farquad's castle, along with Donkey as his guide, so that he can make Lord Farquad send the fairy tale creatures go back to their homes. After getting to his castle and getting involved in and winning a WWF type of tournament, Farquad makes a deal with him, and sends Shrek on a quest to save Princess Fiona from a tower guarded by a dragon. If he completes this, he will get his swamp back.This movie takes all of the fairy tale formulas and messes around with them, creating what was described as a ""fractured fairy tale."" There are several references to recent movies, and in some ways, the beginning of the movie reminds me very much of the beginning of The Hobit. Around the middle, the plot reminds me of the plot in The Big Lebowski. And of course, there are several references to Indiana Jones, The Matrix, and I could go on forever, but if you want a better idea, then watch the movie.This looks like a kids movie, but in some ways I think that this was intended more for teens and adults. Kids can still enjoy the bright animation, and there is kid friendly humor. This is what I think of as a real family movies. I think that genre has been defined the wrong way, because every time you see something that is considered to be a family movie, it's intended for kids eight and under. That is what you would call a children's movie, a family movie is something that even the adults and teenagers will be able to watch and enjoy.If you somehow missed this during its years that it has been around for, then see it now. And you can watch it some night, with everyone around the television."
699,Shrek,7,29 December 2004,Give it an A for effort,"The field of animation has come to be regarded as strictly for children, which makes it all the more surprising when a gem like Shrek tries to aim for something other than the lowest common denominator. Indeed, this is almost a return to the days when fairy tales had something of a moral, and often a good one. The problem, as so often happens in animation, is that the performance of the characters is often reduced to a singular note after a certain point. Thankfully, the note they do play is pleasant to the ear, so to speak, for the most part.Mike Meyers really ought to consider doing voice-over work full-time. His performance in front of the camera has reached a point where he seems only able to portray stereotypes, and even his stereotypes all seem alike after a while. Behind a microphone, on the other hand, his performance becomes a whole different story. Granted, he doesn't sound like anything more than Mike Meyers trying to sound Scottish, but he does it well enough that the voice fits the character. The rest is sold by the exquisite animation. A critique of Ralph Bakshi's attempt at The Lord Of The Rings stated that while simple, subtle gestures are harder to animate, they are much more effective. Shrek is a case in point.Eddie Murphy is ponderously annoying as Donkey, the sidekick. This is where one of the fundamental weaknesses in Shrek becomes clear. There is nothing Shrek does with Donkey that he cannot do without Donkey. Granted, the scene with Donkey and the dragon is funny, but aside from that moment, Donkey's schtick gets terribly annoying in a hurry.Cameron Diaz, like Meyers, proves that she is easier to take when she is behind a microphone rather than in front of a camera. The character of Fiona, and the story behind her, is one of Shrek's crowning touches. The reason why she fears to be seen during the evening is explored with more satisfaction in the sequel, but it says something about the usual fairy tale canon.In the end, however, Shrek is just too short. Ninety minutes is not enough time to explore characters with such potential. I realise that the film is primarily marketed at a child audience, but there are numerous other films aimed at such an audience where character development, rather than short attention spans, has been treated as a priority. Or perhaps it is just economical use of the screen time. Much of Shrek's screen time is devoted to in-jokes about fairy tales and such, when a bit of time explaining exactly *why* Farquaad is such a killjoy would have done wonders.Nonetheless, I gave Shrek a seven out of ten. It isn't the best animated feature I've ever seen, and there certainly are better fantasy stories out there. What Shrek has going for it is that it doesn't take itself more seriously than the material demands. And unlike many that make this claim, it can truly keep all members of a family entertained. Such is getting rare in this day and age where ""all ages"" excludes anyone whose age can be measured with two digits."
700,Shrek,8,24 December 2004,The first CG-animated film to beat Pixar at their own game - 83%,"The second film I've viewed today (well, it is Christmas Eve - what do you expect?) is also considered something of a classic and has also made a tremendous impact in it's field. And while it may share similar themes, the one thing ""Shrek"" is not is ""The Lord of the Rings"". What it is, however, is a highly entertaining animated movie crammed with enough to satisfy the kids as well as cynical adults (that's you and me, dear reader).The film tells the story of a reclusive ogre called Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) living in a faraway kingdom, populated by brave knights and fire-breathing dragons. However, not everything goes to script. Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is conducting a witch-hunt of all fairy-tale creatures such as the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio and a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy). Soon, our heroes set off on a quest to rescue the fair maiden Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) who, like Shrek himself, isn't all that she seems.This was, arguably, the film that woke Disney up. It broke the company's monopoly on animated feature films and although it wasn't the first, nothing as commercially successful as ""Shrek"" had ever been seen before. It even goes so far as to mock Disney's rose-tinted view of the world, Lord Farquaad's castle bearing a striking resemblance to Disney's theme-parks. If ""Shrek"" hadn't been able to back up the talk then it would be for nought. But it does and it does it very well. It's witty without being patronising, wonderful to look at without being overly cute and entertaining for people for all ages - something Disney hadn't been able to do until it began partnering with Pixar.Credit must go to the voice cast who do a fantastic job with the characters. And although it sticks in my throat to admit it, I didn't mind Eddie Murphy as he was considerably less annoying than he has been in the latter stages of his career. You could say that Donkey has the best lines and although he does go on quite a bit, you don't mind so much because he's funny. Unlike, say, ""Daddy Day Care"". What I find interesting is that Disney don't have a response to the challenge. With ""Antz"", they realise ""A Bug's Life"". With ""Finding Nemo"", Dreamworks SKG counter with ""A Shark's Tale"". With ""Shrek"", Disney has no answer and that is a sign that a film is truly unique and special. I would recommend most people to watch ""Shrek"" at least once. If you think it's a kid's film then you'd be right. But at the end of the day, aren't we all kids at heart?"
701,Shrek,10,24 December 2004,Great,"The genius of this film is amazing. The way that the comical yet thought-provoking story line keeps the viewer involved and amused at the same time. It has such a charming fairytale story behind a funny, amusing shell which is almost guaranteed to keep viewers of all ages enthralled. It's not without its faults though. The comedy occasionally goes too far and you soon begin to see how Shrek gets so annoyed with Donkey as he is just SO annoying sometimes! That said, the film is a masterpiece and I would recommend it to anyone due to the shear entertainment factor, original story and great characters. Very clever film in many ways but be prepared - if you are looking for a serious film, look elsewhere although it has a few moral thoughts behind it. If you want side splitting entertainment, watch it - you'll love it!"
702,Shrek,7,12 September 2004,"The Original, not always the best !","I waited for the shrek 2 so as to give an opinion on this one. I liked the two better.Shrek has become a worldwide standard in animation technology.The characters are beautifully animated and the textures, while not as good as the 2, are nonetheless beautifully done !The plot is well ""directed"" as well, you never get bored and get transported by the story, watching as you go, enjoying the show.One little note: I found the french version of the movie well above the English one. I don't know how it was possible, but the french voices where more adapted to the characters and the feelings where much more sincere. Eddy and cameron should watch closely and learn."
703,Shrek,10,8 September 2004,Donkey is an Outstanding Character!!!,This movie is perfect for all ages which is what all excellent movies are. The jokes are actually really clever and original which is pretty rare these days. Mike Myers does an outstanding job as the voice of Shrek and I also thought Cameron Diaz was excellent as Fiona but the best voice of all without a doubt was Eddie Murphy's Donkey. The lines of this character are just outstanding and when you add to that how well they are said by Eddie it just makes for the perfect character. If you try and imagine this movie without Donkey it's actually a pretty flat and boring film with very few decent jokes and clever lines. Don't get me wrong Shrek has some stunners but they just wouldn't work as well without Donkey.
704,Shrek,10,5 July 2004,I think it my comments reflect the movie well.,"The directors of Shrek are Andrew Adamson as co-director who did BATMAN FOREVER, A TIME TO KILL and BATMAN and ROBIN. Vicky Jenson as the other co-director who did FAMILY TREE and SHARK TALE. The genres are Adventure / Romance / Animation / Fantasy / Family / Comedy.In a faraway land called Duloc, a ruler but not yet king, the small Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) has banished all the fairy tale characters from the land so it can be as boring as he is. However, there are three characters that will stand is his way. The first is a smelly, green ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers), his faithful steed, a Donkey (Eddie Murphy), who will do anything but shut up, and the beautiful, but tough Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) whom Lord Farquaad wishes to make his wife so he can become king of Duloc.My favourite character is Donkey. I like him because of his scene of humour and a habit of always getting in trouble when Shrek needs him most. Donkey is one of those characters that never shuts up, he can sometimes get very annoying. Sometimes you just want to get rid of him but then he saves your life so you keep him following you.The animation in this film was quite amazing and it must have taken the producers a long time to get the film to this standard. Some of the scenes are almost realistic with the scene with the dragon it really looks like it is about to come down and take you into the screen. I didn't find a single fault with the animation in this film and it was breathtaking the amount of hard work put into this amazing film."
705,Shrek,7,7 May 2003,What the...?,"I thought the whole point of the movie, that is to turn Disney Fantasy archetypes and cinematic myths upside down with bad taste written all over it (on purpose!), was pretty clear to anyone. I thought the moral aspects were obvious either. I was wrong!... incredible.From the comments I've read around here, many people simply didn't get it. It's quite amazing, as I don't think the movie is ambiguous in any way. Weak plot? Bad taste? Sure, guys, it's the point! Can't you simply forget about your beloved archetypes, your hunger for ""beautiful"" stories, and look at the film for what it is, with fresh eyes? Gee, there's even a intelligent moral point for children, i.e. heroes aren't necessarily beautiful or rich! If Fiona stays an ogre at the end, it's to demonstrate this! The filmmakers want us to love Fiona for what she is, not what she looks like, unlike the Disney productions, in which heroines don't have any choice, they HAVE to be gorgeous (even when pretending the contrary, as in ""Mulan"").I never thought I'd have to explain this, it's so obvious. To my sense, people who only see bad taste and bad plot in Shreck have identity problems. They've been bread on Disney's productions and cinematic archetypes and myths, they consider these things as sacred, as a part of themselves, they take it personally, as if Shreck made fun of THEM (which is, to a certain extent, true..). Some may even be jealous of Fiona because they've been told since their childhood that heroines MUST be beautiful, so why on earth is Fiona a heroin though I'm not? Don't take it personally, it's the PROCESS that Shreck makes fun of, not you guys and gals.One could describe, in a way, Shreck as being an UNfairy tale... and that's the good thing about it. In its insanity, Shreck is among the most sane movies I've seen so far.Shreck is a parody of all modern cinematic myths, encapsulated in a pseudo-fairy tale as a mere pretext. Shreck is a movie-referential and self-referential clever story about the way people look at movies and the way they warship and praise cinematic myths, and that's the fun of it. The way people react to Shreck is quite interesting. It makes the movie even more meaningful, though I doubt the filmmakers were ever aware of that.Now I'm not saying Shreck is a fine piece of art, and I can understand some critics I've read about the ""cool"" aspects of the movie. But I personally think that Shreck IS a good movie, and the interesting story it tells is not in the plot itself, it's in the WAY this ""weak"" plot is told... Thumbs up to the crew.Well I know that for many of you all this was already obvious.Substance  7/10Technical aspects   8/10Artistic aspects  6/10Entertainment   9/10Overall 7.5/10"
706,Shrek,1,9 July 2001,Let's make fun out of Disney... NOT!,"Well, at least a good idea. But when it comes down to the movie, they made a Disney movie themselves.The dialogues are simple and every single joke is explained in detail for the brainless. Mike Myer's voice doesn't fit the character of Shrek at all. John Goodman's would have been much better. Too bad he was already the peasant in Disney's ""The Emperor's New Groove"". Eddie Murphy was funny in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" more then ten years ago but not anymore.""Shrek"" is altogether a ROMANTIC(!!!) comedy (Disney) with a lot of ""good-heart-ugly-looks""-moral (Disney) and a predictable happy end (again, Disney). It is a computer animated masterpiece (stunning visuals) for older couples, who just don't get Toy-Story-like fast-paced cartoon humour.As I like to call it: A remake of Disney's ""The Beauty and the Beast"" with three or four toothless jokes and with the worst, most disturbing, least fitting soundtrack EVER!!!If you want to have fun with CG-movies, go out and rent Toy Story 1 and 2 and Antz."
707,Shrek,7,16 July 2016,All hail the Ogrelord,"To be perfectly honest, when I first saw this movie, I didn't like it in the slightest. Overtime, the movie has grown on me. It is not the G.O.A.T of animated movies. Not even close. But for what it's worth, it's Dreamwork's crowning achievement.And yes, this is out of all of Dreamwork's other movies that I enjoy, including Mega-mind, Rise of the Guardians, and Madagascar (the first one, not the sequels). Speaking of sequels, Shrek surpasses its sequels in multiple ways, especially the last one. That is something you can only say for a few choice movies, like Finding Nemo, The Lion King, and How to Train Your Dragon. Shrek 1 is just that good.I know, you're probably looking at this review like ""Where are my memes? I must have my ogre memes!"" Sorry, but serious review... okay, semi- serious. Mars Bars. There's your meme. Now go away.Memorable, enjoyable, and lighthearted, Shrek will exist and excite for years to come."
708,Shrek,,11 December 2014,A misunderstood animated feature.,"For some god awful reason audiences pay top dollar for ""Shrek"" films. There's been four of these tragically awful works put to screen, each one raising higher anticipation than the next. ""Shrek"" does a fine job spending big bucks to place a different type of story out there with a hidden love. I say hidden because ""Shrek"" is one of the more gritty animated features with a PG rating of all time. Instead of crafting gorgeous visuals with heartfelt to the point of tears stories like Disney Pixar, Dreamworks went for an original story that was not only extremely agitating but ruthlessly dull. Sure, everyone if special no matter if they're an ogre or an annoying donkey. How hard is it to figure out? We could guess where the heart was coming from based on the poster, except the heart never really comes. I will say ""Shrek"" has some of the biggest and well-suited actors you can get for an animated film. An ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers), in order to regain his swamp, travels along with an annoying donkey (Eddie Murphy) in order to bring a princess (Cameron Diaz) to a scheming lord, wishing himself King. Pretty clever, huh? Not really. The story fails in a scheming scheme of rudeness and action. Each scene if more obnoxious than the next, leaving you either in love with this dim-witted story or ready to skip the next sequel Dreanmworks throws at us due to having no other creative ideas like Pixar or other animated film companies."
709,Shrek,6,15 April 2001,Great for kids and adults,"Shrek is an ogre living in a swamp.  He enjoys his solitude, enjoys scaring off the villagers who try to roust him out, and enjoys a nice bowl of eyeballs for lunch.Enter everyone in fairydom (major fairy tale cameos here).  Lord Farquard is clearing the fairy folk off his land and resettling them... in Shrek's swamp.Shrek and Donkey (a talking donkey Shrek accidentally saved from the resettlement squad and now can't seem to get rid of) go off to get Lord Farquard to get all these people out of Shrek's swamp.  The result is a bargain.  Shrek will rescue a cursed princess from a castle in a lava pit that's guarded by a dragon and Farquard will remove the fairy folk from the swamp.It's a cute movie and there are definitely some funny scenes.  It feels like they did a bit of tossing in everything but the kitchen sink when it comes to parodying fairy tales, some modern institutions, and even The Matrix, but the bulk of it works and what doesn't can be forgiven in the face of the many laughs that do come along.All in all, a good cuddly date movie if you've got an evening free, and a good family movie for the weekends.  I'd give it a 7/10."
710,Shrek,7,3 June 2001,HILARIOUS!! A MUST SEE!!!,"This movie was funny from the beggining, it has great character voices, nicely done smooth graphics, and tons of laughs. I'm not gonna give you the whole plot, but i'll tell you it's definately a must see.(By the way, the rumors of Chris Farley doing the voice of Shrek - they're true, he had signed on to the contract before he died, and Mike Myers took over for his friend afterwards.)"
711,Shrek,10,25 September 2017,smarty,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold It's a cool place and they say it gets colder You're bundled"
712,Shrek,9,1 April 2017,Amazing Animated Movie. Would definitely recommend.,"Plot Overview: Shrek(Mike Myers), an outcast ogre, and Donkey(Eddie Murphy), a donkey, embark upon a quest to save Princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz) from a castle when their swampland is threatened.Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky JensonStarring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron DiazOverall: This movie is a fantastic animated movie and one of the best non-Disney animated films ever made. It helped create a new Oscar! The first movie to EVER win Best Animated Feature Film should show the greatness of the films. It's a perfect Disney parody and I wholeheartedly recommend it.Good:1. Both Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz are excellent as Shrek and Princess Fiona respectively.2. Eddie Murphy was, without a shadow of a doubt, the star performance as Donkey and proves that the sidekick can greatly outshine the hero. Not to say Shrek is a bad character but Donkey is just plain excellent.3. The story is a unique take on the typical fairy tale and takes every opportunity to mock fairy tale archetypes which I admire. It's a parody but it's not over the top like with the likes of 'Scary Movie' or 'Hot Shots'. It knows the line between fun and stupid and rides that line perfectly.4. There are numerous underlying themes throughout this movie which give it more of a heart than other parodies and cements it as an all time great animated movie.5. Shrek and Donkey's chemistry is nigh flawless and they go together like tea and biscuits. They are undoubtedly one of the greatest sets of animated buddies.6. The writing here is awesome and the humour works so well. It's a parody but knows they're is a line. It pokes fun at tropes and Disney in general but also delivers plenty of other humour that many people can enjoy.Bad:1. Lord Farquad is such a dull and uninteresting villain and does take away from the movie as a whole. With a better villain, I would call this a true 10/10 animated masterpiece but this flaw does affect the whole movie and knocks it down a peg.2. The lip syncing could be a little dodgy at times and the animation quality looks dated.9/10Would Recommend."
713,Shrek,9,30 December 2016,A romantic fairy tale with a difference,"Set in a world of fairy tales where fairy tale creatures find themselves persecuted by the unpleasant Lord Farquaad there is a big green ogre named Shrek. Shrek lives alone in his swamp; which is just how he likes it so he is less than happy when all the fairy tale characters turn up saying they are there because of Lord Farquaad. Shrek goes to see him, along with Donkey, a talking Donkey who Shrek finds annoying. Once there Farquaad tells him that he can have his swamp back if he goes on a quest; to rescue the Princess Fiona from a tower which is protected by a fire breathing dragon. She is waiting to be rescued by her 'true love' so is rather surprised to find herself rescued by an ogre. As they head back Shrek develops feelings for Fiona and it emerges that Princess Fiona is subject to a witch's curse; when the sun sets she is a very different person.This animated fairy tale has become a modern classic thanks to the way it plays with traditional tropes and incorporates elements of many classic into its story. All too often a beautiful damsel in distress is rescued by her handsome Prince Charming and if for some reason he is less then handsome her kiss will free him of that curse and make him perfect not here though. Shrek is an ogre and he is staying an ogre and Princess Fiona well you'll have to watch the film. There are lots of laughs from start to finish and a good but not overstated message about the nature of true beauty. The animation is top notch with great character designs. These characters are voiced by familiar actors; most notably Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and John Lithgow and they do a fine job bringing their animated characters to life. The humour is likely to appeal to all ages; a few gags might be a little crude but these are likely to go over the heads of younger viewers. Overall I'd say this is a great film that can be enjoyed by everybody."
714,Shrek,10,27 December 2016,really good,"its a excellent film with great comedy. donkey is the best. I think Shrek is really great for different ages. Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy-comedy film directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debut. It features the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow.. It is loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book Shrek!, and somewhat serves as a parody film, targeting other films adapted from numerous children's fantasies (mainly animated Disney films). The film's soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, Baha Men, and John Cale (covering Leonard Cohen).The film grossed $484.4 million at the worldwide box office, and an estimated 47 million tickets were sold in the US. Shrek also received promotion from food chains such as Baskin-Robbins (promoting the film's DVD release) and Burger King. It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humour to appeal to children. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice-over performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's main (and title) character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010"

716,Shrek,10,18 November 2016,Definitely a Masterpiece!,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. I used to watch it when I was younger and recently I re-watched in Blu-ray, and i remembered why i used to love this movie. In my humble opinion , almost everything in this film is sensational... From the music and the soundtrack to the chemistry between the main characters, the plot and the incredible animation for a 2001 film (15 years ago). A great film for children and adults too... Full of adventure, comedy and magic as every good animated film should be. So if you have not watched this movie yet, what are you waiting for? Watch it in high definition and get excited and have fun at the same time. (PS: Sorry my English)"
717,Shrek,8,31 October 2016,What happens when you put Disney and Looney Tunes in a blender? You get Shrek,"Shrek is a perfect example of a movie that blends the character driven nature of a Walt Disney Animation Studios film and the satire of of a Looney Tunes cartoon.To critique this movie, I will start with the bad, as usual, then end with the good.The Bad: 1. Uses some humour clichés like, fart jokes, for example. 2. Takes a slightly overly crude direction, but it doesn't make it a bad film, fortunately.The Good: 1. Gorgeous animation that has a nice balance of looking cartoony and realistic at the same time. 2. Easy cast of characters to like, like the cantankerous titular character, Shrek, the talkative donkey, Donkey, the feisty princess and love interest, Fiona, and the evil and oppressive villain, Lord Farquaad. 3. Humour and satire, for the most part, has a nice balance of not being overly politically correct and not being mean spirited, likewise with The Simpsons and Looney Tunes. 4. Beautiful film score courtesy of Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell. 5. Excellent voice acting courtesy of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow.Overall, Shrek is a great and timeless animated film with likable characters, lovely animation, good comedy, great voice acting and a wonderful film score."
718,Shrek,9,18 October 2016,In review,"Lord Farquaad has taken over Shrek's swamp with fairy tale creatures and the only way Shrek can get his swamp back is if he goes and saves Princess Fiona from the castle she is locked up in because Lord Farquaad has his heart set on her. As you can tell already Shrek is a fun movie mainly for younger kids, but people of all ages have grown to love this movie. A big green ogre who slowly falls in love with a princess isn't really anything common for a romantic fairy tale, and that's why this movie has been considered a favorite by so many people. The movie Shrek puts a completely different spin on how fairy tales are usually written, and I think that this movie really has impacted what fairy tales are l Dreamworks animation did a great job animating the movie Shrek with creatures from other fairy tales like, the 3 blind mice, the big bad wolf, 3 little homeless pigs, and it is all put into one movie. It puts a whole different spin on these characters, the big bad wolf is lazy and lays in Shreks bed all day, and the homeless little pigs are only homeless because the wolf blew their houses down, but they are all friends in Shrek. I think it's awesome to see all of these different movies combined in one. Everything anywhere you look during the movie would have a ton of detail. When you watch Shrek for the first time, you see an ogre for the first time. The animation really shows how big and sometimes scary Shrek could be. It really helps set up the plot of this movie. Another thing that I think was done really well in Shrek was the use of songs and people dancing in the movie at random times. It really catches the attention of a lot of the people in the audience. The music plays a big part in the movie and it really helps get across what the characters are feeling, for example when Princess Fiona sings so loud it blows up a bird, and Shrek and Fiona are starting to fall in love with each other, which you can also tell because they blow up different animals for each other and use them like they are balloons. For an ogre, I guess you could say that is an act of love.If you are sick of the fairy tales that are all about romance and love stories, then I recommend watching Shrek. It is fun for people of all ages and it won't leave you disappointed."
719,Shrek,10,7 August 2016,The best animated movie ever,"I don't think an ogre based movie could be more funnier than this one. No doubt It won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Film. It's a great tale about an ogre shrek and a donkey. I'd say that donkey is the most funniest character of all the animated movies that i've watched yet.It's a story that begins with and focuses on shrek, an Ogre who enjoys living his life alone in his own swamp. He goes on a quest with this donkey named Donkey who keeps talking endlessly to rescue a princess named Fiona from a dragon. She was waiting there to be rescued by a kiss from a charming prince to lift the curse from her. This movie contains a lot of fairy tail characters which makes it hard to focus on just one.The 3d effects in this movie are awesome as one could expect from dreamworks production. Star casts are Mike Myers, Camron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and John Lighthow who made this movie more delightful that everyone can enjoy. One of the thing that i liked about this movie is its music which is really spectacular and a lot better than other animated movies. The animated sceneries are really beautifully colored and characters are very lifelike.The ending of this movie is a perfect happy ending. Without a doubt this movie is totally worth to watch. A great movie experience for all the animated movie fans!"
720,Shrek,10,23 June 2016,When DreamWorks reared its ugly head...,"You know the Simpsons joke of the blue-haired lawyer representing Disney whenever a public domain's character is impersonated, well this running-gag reflects a general feeling that all the princesses, little pigs or fairies belong to Disney, and no one would dare or care of touching them, not to make the lawyers sharpen their nails anyway.But once upon a time a studio named DreamWorks, whose works' dream was to kick the the round-ear giant's butt by playing his own game without the same rules. So their movie starts with a book (just like in Uncle Disney's classics) whose first pages tell us about a princess victim of a spell, and waiting for her savior in a high dungeon guarded by a drag nonsense, shouts the reader, tearing the page and leaving the toilet a few seconds later. Well, what he did with the paper might be the extreme way to describe DreamWorks' attitude toward Disney, from us who consider Disney and fairy tales as alter-egos.But by parodying all its fairy-tale darlings, it's less a thumb nose on Disney that an irreverence setting the tone of the future of Animation. Before ""Shrek"", movies like ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"" or ""Ants"" evolved in very cartoon-like universes and only 3D enhanced their originality. Once the novelty was over, films like ""Dinosaurs"" would feature dazzling and realistic environments. But who remembers ""Dinosaurs""? ""Shrek"" had distinctive characters, and great technology to define their movements, fur, skin or body language, but more than anything, it had a terrific story to tell.For all these reasons, it was the first Oscar animated feature winner, beating ""Monsters, Inc."" from pioneer Pixar. Disney paved the way to 3D animation with ""Toy Story"" in 1995 yet it is its foremost rival that gets the seminal award. Both would be listed in the American Film Institute's Top 1 Animated movies, and ""Shrek"" at eight position is the only non Disney film. While there's no doubt that Disney had the lion-share of recognition on this field, I'm convinced that the enthusiasm, energy and perfectionism that was put in their later works were boosted by DreamWorks' affront in 2001.""Shrek"" might look like an anti-Disney film, but it's for Disney's own good, an invitation to use, simple stories involving a great deal of fun, friendship and a well-balanced dose of adult-oriented humor, with enough simplicity on the surface to appeal to children. Pixar would later beat DreamWorks on that game but in 2001, ""Shrek"" was the triumphant story, the hero is an ogre, the sidekick is a donkey), the villain is a Kingdom ruler who's not a king yet for technicality, and the princess is a princess but with more style, character and pep than all the other Disney princesses put together. ""Shrek"" takes into a very familiar universe, but gives it a sly edge, a saucy and raunchy humor, and still affords the luxury to have a sensibility.The secret of ""Shrek"" is to exploit the one thing Disney would never do, making adult humor and mocking its creation. When Shrek and the Donkey discovers the castle of Sir Farquard, they wonder if he's not compensating for something, later this is used again, and makes the gag twice funnier. The Disney bashing is less tricky and has never been as efficient as when Princess Fiona hums a song with a bird, with such high-pitched octaves he poor creature explodes. That alone was funny, but that she uses the birds' three eggs to make a breakfast is just the bit of genius that justifies all the film's reputation.And indeed, the magic of Shrek is to use familiar situation for different outcomes, whether the dragon in the castle or a Robin Hood gang, the film always finds a way to surprise you, hell, can you even imagine that milk being poured on a glass will mean that a Gingerbread is about to be tortured? ""Shrek"" is surprise after surprise, and yet manages to get more archetypal when needed to, because it doesn't let the laughs guide the story, but develops a sweet and tender romance between Shrek and Fiona who have more in common than they think.Indeed, Shrek only terrorizes people to precede their reaction and not be hurt by their feelings. Princess Fiona is no typical either, and the charm of the film is to learn more about these characters as the plot advances. And ""Shrek"" finds the perfect balance between gags and drama, so that it turns into one of the all-time greatest romances, spanning three more sequels while sequels to fairy tales have never been Disney's strong suits. But you can't have a character like Shrek or Fiona or the Donkey reduced to one simple film, especially considering the time it took to make them grace the silver screen.The project started in 1994, the same years than ""Toy Story"", except that it took more time for DreamWorks to get the job done, Shrek's part was recorded with Chris Farley but it would finally be Mike Meyers to take the role and give it a slight Scottish accent. Eddie Murphy was given the role of a lifetime by injecting his zany persona to the most happy-go-lucky, optimistic Donkey ever, and more than honorable mentions to Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, or John Lithgow as Farquaad. Like in ""Toy Story"", the choice of voice-actors is part of the marketing and can be sometimes distracting, except when the story is so absorbing. That Donkey's voice is Eddie Murphy's is secondary in relation to his hilarious one-liners.""Shrek"" showed the light to the future of animation, but beyond its influential significance, ""Shrek"" is a standout animated classic, the only one I can recall, with a twist ending. I still remember, in the theater, I didn't like the ending, until I realized it was the perfect one. How many movies, animated or not, can contradict your feelings, but for perfect reasons?"
721,Shrek,10,21 December 2015,Best Animated Comedy of This Generation,"Shrek, More Like KekI just saw the movie Shek and I wanted to write a review, so here I am...the movie was such a craaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzyyyyyy journey, from the swamps to the cops chasing the protagonist Shork through in a castle far far away. The antagonist Lord Fartcod, is a male with a maximum height of 3'4"" and a swaggy horse named Kooky, to counter Shork's sloth Donker, who is obsessed with corn dogs. I own the movie on the special VCR collector's edition that has Leonardo DiCaprio playing the part of Gingivitis, the gingerbread man, I think this is a very nice edition...however the part of the three blind mice was played by Macaulay Culkin which I think was a very bad idea, but that can be forgiven by Seth Rogen's role as Kooky. My favorite part of Shek is probably the part were (spoiler) Donker is walking on a bridge over lava and he falls but is saved last minute, by Kooky's cousin Gorby....Donker and Gorby realize their love and stick together. The musical score by the band The Spice Girls, with the main theme song of the movie being Wannabe (Shek's lover). Overall I think Shek is a fantas-tickle movie being the best movie of the CENTURY...11 out of 10."
722,Shrek,10,2 December 2015,In love with a Fairytale,"2001 was the year of fantasy and adventure movies. Including the animated fairytale Shrek. Or a modern fairytale with pop culture references. The movie has a Soundtrack too. That soundtrack includes a lot of classics like Hallejujah. In this movie Shrek the ogre must go on an adventure to get his swamp back from an evil lord. On his journey Shrek meets with a donkey and a princess. The twist is that the princess is an ogre too. In the end the lord tries to marry the princess, but he gets defeated. So Shrek gets his swamp back, and gets married. The beautiful music and background animation spices this movie up that got a well deserved Oscar.10/10"

724,Shrek,,13 May 2015,Perhaps my favorite prince and princess story,"I love this movie, it's funny, clever, entertaining and fun for the whole family, but another thing i love about it is the message it leaves for the viewers as well, as unlike many Disney movies, in Shrek you can look and smell like an ugly ogre and still find your true love.This movie may be one of my favorite animated movies out there and i would highly recommend watching it if you already haven't.The only thing i dislike about this movie is the duration, at only 90 minutes, though not too short compared to other animated movies, it still left me wanting more. Luckely for me and others who felt just the same, there are several sequels out there so there's more to go."
725,Shrek,9,30 April 2015,Shrek,"Shrek is a brilliant movie that appeals to EVERY age out there. Shrek has often been made into kids toys and given to kids as presents, while on the other hand is my 70+ year old grandfathers favorite movie ever. The story is about a mean ogre who just wants to be left alone. Shrek does not like the fact that the king has banished all mystical creatures to his swamp. So Shrek becomes friends with simple minded donkey and leaves to talk with the king. The king realizes that this strong ogre is the perfect person to find his princess and save her from the scary dragon. When Shrek does so he falls in love with the princess and needs to find a way to stop her and the kings wedding.I have given this movie a 9 out of 10 because it is hilarious, well written and full of great voice actors including Eddie Murphy. In conclusion this is a great movie and will be shown for years to come."
726,Shrek,7,13 January 2015,A Solid Entry in the DreamWorks Canon,"An ogre (Mike Myers), in order to regain his swamp, travels along with an annoying donkey (Eddie Murphy) in order to bring a princess (Cameron Diaz) to a scheming lord, wishing himself King.""Shrek"" is possibly the most successful cartoon from DreamWorks, or at least the one that really launched the brand. Now it seems a bit overshadowed by other entries, including ""How To Train Your Dragon"", but clearly they knew what they were doing with the computer-generated medium, and knew how to craft a story from classic elements.Some have said it is best to forget the film had sequels and just focus on the original. Whether or not this is a fair view, it does not matter. No sequel, good or bad, can change the original. And this is a strong original and allows for plenty of exploration of the world."
727,Shrek,9,22 October 2014,Laugh Out Loud Comedy,"For an animated comedy film based on fairy-tales this movie is outstanding. I never knew my childhood fairy stories could be so funny. I laughed out loud so hard when I first saw this film I had tears streaming down my cheeks.I'll admit it: I'm still a sucker for good old-fashioned fairy-tales. I love a good comedy as well. So Shrek is my style of humor. It is one of the cutest stories and animated films I've ever seen.Shrek is not just for kids/teens - most film loving adults that I've talked movies with loves the Shrek film series. So, if you have not seen Shrek yet then you are missing out on a very funny flick.9/10"
728,Shrek,10,25 July 2014,My Favourite Movie,"Great design, inclusion of excellent quotes great movie must watch . The best characters such as Eddie Murphy mean a great movie here and there, there is some giggles and excitement a.This movie is definitely one which engages the reader deeply into the movie Overall I believe It is a Great movie and if you haven't watched it you will miss out On thebgreatest movie on all times. Love love love Shrek. Donkey as Eddie Murphy a great role in the movie he is so finny and deeply engages you in many times you will think you are donkey. By far out of all Shrek this is most definitely the best one because it has the involvement of many characters which make the movie more interesting the new ones are just the same but have lest."
729,Shrek,9,6 July 2014,"""For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.""","Shrek is Dreamworks biggest and best film franchise with 3 sequels, various specials and 1 spin off. But whilst the sequels are good, none even compare to the original. This is a masterpiece in both animation and writing to make one of the earliest and best CGI animated films.This film keeps making me laugh no matter how many times I've watched it. Throughout it mocks just about every typical fairytale cliché, parodying every detail from the brave dashing knight being a big ogre to the helpless princess being a kick ass chick with attitude. Ironically in their parodying of the stereotypical fairytale romances, it also creates one of their best. Shrek and Fiona are such a perfect couple. Every moment they're together it just feels right. Whether they're bonding over being outcasts or just because of their love of weedrat stew the pair just feel perfect for each other. What puts it above the regular Cinderellas and Snow Whites is that they are both very real characters. Both characters have brilliant designs that have extremely detailed and realistic faces so we always see how the feel. Also they have unique personalities to ensure they stand up from the bland hero and princess formula. Then there's Donkey who makes most of the films funniest moments. Just like Williams with the Genie in Aladdin, Murphy makes this role his own with his fast talking voice suiting Donkey perfectly. Shrek remains one of my favourite films of my childhood. Everything from the soundtrack to the voice acting comes together to make this a great film for the entire family."
730,Shrek,,23 May 2014,Shrek (2001),"Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy-comedy film produced by PDI/DreamWorks, released by DreamWorks Pictures, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, featuring the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. It is loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book Shrek!, and somewhat serves as a parody film, targeting other films adapted from numerous children's fantasies (mainly animated Disney films). The film made notable use of popular music; the soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, Baha Men, and John Cale (covering Leonard Cohen).The rights to the books were originally bought by Steven Spielberg in 1991, before the founding of DreamWorks, when he thought about making a traditionally animated film based on the book. However, John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to DreamWorks in 1994, the time the studio was founded, and the film was put quickly into active development by Jeffrey Katzenberg after the rights were bought by the studio in 1995. Shrek originally cast Chris Farley to do the voice for the title character, recording about 80%90% of his dialog. After Farley died in 1997 before he could finish, Mike Myers was brought in to work for the character, who after his first recording decided to record his voice in a Scottish accent. The film was also originally planned to be motion- captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to get PDI to help Shrek get its final computer-animated look.Earning $484.4 million at the worldwide box office, the film was a critical and commercial success. Shrek also received promotion from food chains such as Baskin-Robbins (promoting the film's DVD release) and Burger King. It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humour to appeal to children. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice-over performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's main (and title) character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.[2]Shrek established DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in the field of feature film animation, particularly in computer animation. The film's success prompted DreamWorks to create three sequels, Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and Shrek Forever After, two holiday specials, Shrek the Halls and Scared Shrekless, and a spin-off film, Puss in Boots. A fifth film, planned as the last of the series, was cancelled in 2009 with the announcement that the fourth film would conclude the series. The film's success also inspired other merchandise, such as video games, a stage musical and even a comic book by Dark Horse Comics"
731,Shrek,10,15 May 2014,Shrek,"Shrek is one of my favorite childhood movie. The first movie is the best movie, I think. Then comes the fourth, second, & then third which I don't like & I haven't seen the entire thing yet and don't plan on it either.I think shrek is a funny, great movie for the family to see. It has comedy for everyone.The best character is donkey. The funny, loyal, annoying, talkative adorable best friend.I also love how they include all the other fairy tales in this movie and how they kind if make fun of them all to."
732,Shrek,10,13 May 2014,"Truly a ""Shrekcellent"" Thriller","""Shrek"" is a charming tale about a lovable green ogre (played by Mike Myers, famous for his acting in the ""Austin Powers"" series) who wants to be alone in his swamp. One day, however, an evil lord named Farquaad (played by John Lithgow) enforced a law that bans all fairytale creatures. The now homeless creatures seek refuge in Shrek's swamp, which as you might expect, irritates our hero. Shrek teams up with a talking donkey (played by the always amazing Eddie Murphy) to confront Farquaad. Farquaad agrees to give Shrek his swamp back on one condition: that he bring Princess Fiona (played by Cameron Diaz) to him so he can wed her. Shrek agrees and he and Donkey are off to the tower to save the princess, but encounter a dangerous fire-breathing dragon! Donkey uses his suave looks and personality to woo the dragon. Shrek rescues Fiona, and over the course of the movie, they begin to bond and grow closer to each other. But all seems ruined when Shrek misinterprets Fiona and Donkey's conversation about ""not wanting to marry a beast"", as its revealed that Fiona is actually an ogre herself! Shrek heroically sacrifices his home and current life to gain a new, better one with Fiona in an amazing adventure.The movie is hilarious, full of humor for both the children and the parents, and all around a jolly good time. The cast is fantastic and I'm glad they all returned for the sequels, which are all just as good as this masterpiece. Shrek is clearly a force to be reckoned with. I can't recommend it enough.11/10. Go get it now."
733,Shrek,9,29 March 2014,Super fun family movie,"Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green ogre happily living alone. Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has rounded up all of the kingdom's magical creatures into Shrek's swamp. Shrek wants his isolation back. It doesn't help that he is now followed by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Farquaad wants to have Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so that he could be a proper king. So Farquaad strikes a deal with Shrek. If Shrek rescues Fiona, Farquaad will return Shrek his swamp.This is simply a super fun family movie. Shrek is an unconventional hero, and Fiona is an unconventional damsel in distress. It turns some of the superficial aspects of fairy tales on its head without straying from the emotional truths. In the end, they are all about finding true love. And this movie is a reminder of a funny Eddie Murphy that is too often missing in his recent movies."
734,Shrek,10,30 December 2013,Classic,"Shrek is an irascible ogre who lives in a swamp and enjoys his isolation. Much against his will, he is pressured into journeying with a donkey to save a Princess from a dragon. The journey turns out to be one of self discovery.Let me say at the start that I am not a big fan of Mike Myers' voicings here. He is OK, but I've heard better. Having said that, everything else about this film is perfect. It would be very good as a straightforward fantasy adventure, but when you factor in the constant, and spot on, potshots at movies in general (and Disney in particular), it raises the game substantially. Factor in CGI of a standard not previously seen, non-stop gags, exhilarating action, and inspired voice talent - especially Eddie Murphy - and you have a classic.I repeat - a classic, and highly recommended."
735,Shrek,10,2 September 2013,"The Perfect Family Film,","Shrek is a fantastic movie with a great and really original storyline with a brilliant voice cast and some really lovable and unforgettable characters.The movie is easily one of the best family films ever made,there is plenty of jokes that will make the whole family laugh,and also plenty of subtle humor that only adults will understand,also the story isn't too dark for children or too childish for adults and there's a lot of not so subtle digs at Disney as well.Mike Myers,Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz all did a fantastic job and as much as I watch this movie and its sequels I never get tired of it,and Donkey is one of my all time favourite fictional characters.I would highly recommend Shrek to people of all ages,as a movie for the whole family,a comedy and just a beautiful animated film.When an ogre's swamp is invaded by fairy tale creatures,Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) must head on a quest with a talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) to save Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) from the dragons castle so she can marry Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) and get his privacy back in his swamp,but he gets more than he bargained for on this journey."
736,Shrek,6,4 July 2013,Eddie Donkey rules.,"Well, of course I have seen Shrek before and I remember liking the crude humor and positive vibe of it. But seeing it again years later... I must have noticed back then, but this time some of the appalling graphics were simply off-putting. Also, the story isn't all that 'together' as it seemed before. And then the s-load of song intermezzi... some were okay, but there were just too many of them.But there are some very positive notes to make also. Shrek himself and (especially!) Donkey are just fantastic characters, as well as a load of (supporting) characters as well, for instance Farquaad (the ugliness of his graphic design is fully 'in character') and Gingerbread Man. Fiona? She has her moments, surely. Dragon? Not so much. A lot of the crude (and less crude) humor is still quite charming though, and some sentimental touches ring nicely through.Not as classic as I had remembered it, but all in all enjoyable, mostly because of Eddie Donkey."
737,Shrek,9,3 May 2013,Beautiful Movie,"This film is very good animation.I am big fun of Shrek.I don't like swamps but I want a house similar to the home of Shrek.Shrek is angry in fact he is brave and kind giant. Donkey must be serious.If he isn't serious, he will put in trouble.However,I love this characters.Film effects are very amazing.this film's animators are very amazing people.We have a lot of animation movie but some animation movies are the worst of all.But Shrek isn't bad.On the contrary, it is one of the best.In may opinion, Shrek is beautiful movie.Shrek can have 9 out of 10"
738,Shrek,8,30 April 2013,A perfect mix of fairy tale and sarcasm,"DreamWorks Animation and their groundbreaking technology fused into this romantic comedy is worthy of all of the praise. All of our favorite Fairy Tales Creatures and even Disneyworld itself aren't safe from some good natured ribbing in this satire featuring a cartoon ogre named Shrek (voice of Mike Myers). His sidekick arrives as a talking donkey (voice of Edie Murphy) while Lord Farquar (voice of John Lithgow), overplayed to perfection, boorishly covets his perfect world of Duloc and needs to marry a Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) to be their King. Myers heroically shines as Shrek, but it is Murphy, the proverbial ""third wheel"" with his comic ramblings and constant need of reassurance, that steals the show"
739,Shrek,9,5 March 2013,Legendary,"This movie is legendary.I am big fan of Shrek.I love swamps.Shrek is maybe arrogant in fact he is soft- hearted.Donkey must be serious.Because he is very talkative.If we judging by animation this movie is epic for animations.I love characters.Sound recording is very amazing.The Sound recorders is very amazing people. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and a lot of amazing characters.Every animation film has problems.It same again and again.Every animation film has 2 main characters and these characters offended at middle of film.When first main character at trouble.Second main character came and save him.And they peace with each other and this is my problem with child films.But they are funny at same time.Fairy tales are very suitable for animation films.It made children's imagination very amazing.Anyway Shrek is beautiful film in my opinion.Shrek can have 9 out of 10"
740,Shrek,8,6 October 2012,"""Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming?""","Colorful animation and entertaining vocal characterizations make ""Shrek"" a fun picture even if the message is a retread from dozens of stories, movies and yes, even fairy tales. Judging people before you get to know them is never a wise way to meet someone new but we do it all the time. So it's not a bad idea to run into someone like Shrek and Fiona who have to grapple through their own insecurities to inspire young and old alike with a teachable moment of tolerance and love.Aside from that, Eddie Murphy's Donkey is a sketch, and it's uncanny how the actor's personality permeates through the character. He had me rolling in that scene after Shrek discovers Fiona's secret and he gets into that eye twitching jag. I still remember that scene pretty vividly even a decade after the picture's release, and it was the one I was eagerly anticipating while watching the film again today.As far as the adult humor goes I'm of mixed opinion because kids today grow up too quickly as it is, and I don't see what value there is for a Gingerbread Man to challenge an adversary to 'eat me' the way he does here. Donkey's exclamation of horror at Shrek's occasion of flatulence is another example, but then I think back to my days at Scout camp and the way everyone reacted to the same type of thing, so I don't want to get too critical. In other words, boys will be boys, and Donkey was just being one of the boys so to speak.You know what else was cool - the musical selections that went with some of the action. My favorite was that revved up version of 'I'm a Believer' near the end, punctuated by Murphy's 'I believe, I believe, I believe' at a staccato pace. The music was just the right accompaniment at just the right spots to make the picture all the more enjoyable. Other animated films would be green with envy."
741,Shrek,8,31 August 2012,"Shrek's funny plot, and top notch animations makes this movie great.","Shrek is fantastically animated, with a stylish and unique story. Even the voice acting is terrific, but I don't recommend this movie to everyone, even if It's great and worth.Shrek is hilarious. The plot is interesting and brings you laughs. It shows the fantastic story of Shrek, a monster that every human hates. I will only say that, nothing else. While the story is great, and funny, I don't recommend this to everyone, because rarely, but critically the story might be not worth for some people, and they might think It is dumb. But, Shrek is brought mostly to laugh, and I'm really glad that I liked the story, and I didn't thought It was bad.Great voice acting and fantastic animation makes this movie a great movie. I was enjoyed seeing the animations, and laughing by the hilarious plot, and characters. The voice acting, especially, makes the movie funny.It's worth, and great, buy it, ENJOY IT!8/10"
742,Shrek,9,7 May 2012,"""The greatest fairy tale never told""","When I was a kid, Shrek used to be one of those films where I kept watching and watching. It never grew old and tiring, it never seemed to let up. It was the best movie ever back then, I was transfixed in a world where anything happens.. So years later (yesterday, to be exact) I watch it again. I wanted to get that feeling of pure nostalgia, understand the moral of the story, and most importantly understand those adult jokes! And with all this build-up, you must agree, Shrek still holds up.What I loved best about Shrek was how it was a satirical view of fairy tales. Each setting, line, and situation mimicked some fairy tale of some sort. We have the clichés, but Shrek knows what they are and puts them in the shredder, creating the perfect piece of imagination. The plot wasn't spoiled, or rotten, it kept going and never let up. Now when I was a kid, I never understood any of the jokes, and you know back then all you were laughing at was the slapstick humor. Now, nowadays, the jokes were comedic gold! I'm surprised at how much adult jokes were hidden underneath, making this one of the riskiest animation films of all time. And that's a good thing. Shrek was sarcastically funny while Eddie Murphy's Donkey kept coming and going with fast-paced, witty lines that never let up. I enjoyed every piece of their dialog exchanges. So we have the good plot, the great jokes. What more could this film contain?! It contains one of the key things an animation needs: heart and soul. And Shrek has every bit of it. One sequence (with Hallelujah playing in the background) was one of the most heartbreaking sequences in animation history. But Shrek knows how to sort out the two. Shrek isn't a joke-filled mess, nor a heartbreaking sob-story, it's a perfect blend of them both, then some. Shrek isn't the best animation film ever, but it sure is one of the best! Those who look down on animation as kid's escapism, think again. Shrek knows how to satisfy all sorts of ages, and does a perfect job of doing so. Shrek IS the greatest fairy tale never told. 9/10."
743,Shrek,10,29 April 2012,great,"I saw ""Shrek"" for the first time in the TV.I wondered this movie.So I watched Cartoons.I really liked this cartoon.I watched Shrek for 7 years. Shrek is a delightful comedy.Anyone watching this film with his family.This is one of my favorite animated films.Kids love this cartoon.I watched this movie many times. The story, the characters, the voices ...I don't bored this movie.Shrek is very cute and romantic.I recommend this film to everyone. Shrek is original, delightful.This is a fantastic story. It stars Mike Myers(Shrek), Eddie Murphy(Donkey), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad), and many others. I congratulate them."
744,Shrek,10,21 April 2012,Brilliant throughout the whole movie!!!,"Shrek is funny,brilliant,and a little suspenseful. It's about an ogre and a donkey who save a princess from a castle guarded by an evil dragon. The princess was cursed by an evil fairy godmother and every night she turns into an ogre, but every night she waits up in the top of the tower and is hoping that her true love will come for her and break her curse by kissing her. Instead an ogre named Shrek comes with his pal named Donkey and saves her. Shrek kisses Fiona (the princess's name) and turns Fiona into an ogre forever, but Shrek and Fiona end up falling in love and they all end up living happily ever after.Please watch the movie because it is a must see!"
745,Shrek,10,19 March 2012,Wonderful Fun!,"""Shrek"" is a fantastic animated movie. It stars Mike Myers(Shrek), Eddie Murphy(Donkey), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad), and many others. This comedy is rated PG and lasts for an hour and a half but you'll be laughing long after that.The sequels were good too, but this is the classic that started it all! This is a story of acceptance. The comedy isn't complex, the jokes may not seem to be to original but they definitely make you laugh out loud. Shreck is an ogre, a mythological creature who is fierce and ugly, who's solitude is disrupted when a talking donkey wanders into his life. As soon as this happens a group of other mythological creatures happens to come along and take residence in his swamp. Furious with his life being interrupted, Shrek decides to go to Lord Farquaad and demand that his swamp return to the way it was. When he arrives Lord Farquaad gives him an offer. ""Rescue the Fair Princess Fiona and I will return your swamp to the way it was."" On his quest Shrek and Donkey encounter mishaps and merry men which will make your stomach hurt from all the laughing. I don't care for animated movies that have dancing and singing, but I couldn't pull myself from this movie. I enjoyed this movie and think you will too."
746,Shrek,9,5 March 2012,A classical tale of a unique hero,"We've all grown up watching and hearing fairy tales such as Sleeping Beauty, The Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and a countless list of others. What if all that was parodied in one big film? That's Shrek for you. Shrek not only gives you hilarious glimpses of all these fairy tales but also tells a beautiful story..Shrek, a loner, a creature who is not only a rebel but is also hated by society because he's an ogre, wants his privacy more than anything else. However, the evil king has sent all fairy tale creatures to Shrek's swamp and Shrek doesn't appreciate it. The king makes a promise to Shrek, that if he goes and rescues the King's bride to be, he will give him his swamp back. There starts the journey of Shrek accompanied by the annoying, talking donkey.Shrek is entertainment from start to finish. The film has brains, but more importantly, it has a heart.The lines are witty, amusing, put a smile on your face. The chemistry between Shrek and Donkey is a high point of the film. Another high point is the surprise in the movie involving the princess.All the voice overs are perfect. Mike Myers is great. Eddie Murphy is hilarious. Ditto for the others.The animation is first rate.Overall, a fun film which puts a smile on your face by the end of the screening.One of my all time favorite animation films."

748,Shrek,10,10 September 2011,Shrek (2001) - Ogres + Donkies + Princesses = AWESOME FAIRY TALE!,"""Shrek"" is the revolutionary stepping stone of DreamWorks Animation. It tells the story of an ogre named Shrek, who goes on a daring journey with a talking donkey, to save a princess from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava. Along the way, Shrek learns about love and friendship, and to not be judged for the way we look before you know that particular person. ""Shrek"" is one of the most beautiful, heartwarming, and hilarious pieces of animation I have ever seen in a long time. The hilarious casting ensemble of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, & John Lithgow provided incredible animated performances that stole our hearts forever. Every moment is to die of laughter, especially when the movie is like a parody to the classic fairytale children stories. From the enchanting storyline, the groundbreaking animation, to the wonderful characters, ""Shrek"" is a loving story that should be told and remembered for a long, long time. ""Shrek"" is one of the best animated movies ever, and it should remain a classic for years to come. That's quite an accomplishment for an ogre story. ""Shrek"", in my review, ""an enchanting motion picture, fun for the whole family""."
749,Shrek,,17 August 2011,Fairy tale spoof that is very fun and entertaining to watch for the whole family,"This is a simple fairy tale like story that is one of the best CGI animated movie for the whole family. It's just fun from beginning to end, even now it's known as a movie that set the mark for future CGI animated movies. I especially liked how it mixes a lot of fairy tale characters into one movie, without it being forced. It's a short and yet entertaining journey for the whole family that is most definitely worth seeing with the whole family. The modern feel of the movie with the olden times setting is done really well and the humor works with the great cast of characters. Not going to give anything more away, but I will just say even with repeated watches it's still good. I still think this movie is slightly overrated but it's still a pretty darn good movie.8/10"
750,Shrek,10,4 July 2011,Great movie!,"I think this movie is awesome. The characters are genius and the animation sure looks to have took a long time and a lot of effort in it. I love the romance between Donkey and the dragon. This movie sure took lots of imagination and I appreciate that. My congrats to the Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson. You did a great Job! The soundtrack is also... wonderful, amazing. In my opinion, the best voice award goes to Antonio Banderas, who did a great job, such as the rest of the cast. So, I made this video dedicated to Donkey's love: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQruHQhRYAEnjoy ;D"
751,Shrek,7,1 June 2011,The one that started them all,"The first Shrek is perhaps one of the best family films produced in a long time as it combines all the elements of humour, warmth and good storytelling that these films need.The voice cast is top notch and there are perhaps more magical moments in this film than there were in the rest of the Shrek franchise put together.Dreamworks spotted an opportunity and that is why the Shrek story was milked for so long until much of the magic that made this first film so good was lost. All the Disney bashing is uncalled for as well because without Disney there would be no Dreamworks.This film will remain a favourite for families for generations because the messages are so timeless. What will date it though are all the pop culture references (many of which already are dated) and that may stop the film being as beloved as such classics such as Snow White."
752,Shrek,10,16 May 2011,Worth watching every time,"I first saw Shrek opening weekend in 2001 and have loved it ever since. It starts out by making fun of the storybook approach with Shrek reading out loud and using a page from the book as toilet paper. It then follows with Donkey potentially being sold with many other fairy tale creatures. Shrek involuntarily comes to the rescue as Donkey is trying to escape. However, Donkey will not leave him alone. So Shrek makes him a deal where he can spend one night at Shrek's home. However, Shrek looks outside to find all the famous fairy tale characters are at his swamp. He finds out that Lord Farquaad evicted them and sent them there.So it's up to Shrek and Donkey to meet Lord Farquaad and make a deal to get rid of the fairy tale characters and have his swamp back. Lord Farquaad makes him a deal that if he wins a tournament, he must retrieve Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded castle in the highest room in the tallest tower. However, Shrek is in for something else after he rescues Fiona.The whole plot is just genius at making fun of the fairy tales we have all heard growing up, and at the same time, being its own film. Mike Myers is great at bringing his own style of humor to the title character. What I also like about Myers's performance is how he brings his own emotions and making them Shrek's. Eddie Murphy is also brilliant at bringing his style of humor to the part of Donkey. The best part of Murphy's performance is how he makes his lines memorable.I enjoy the script and seeing the story unfold as we peel back layers of the characters and who they are. It makes me think of one of Shrek's famous quotes in the film: ""Ogres are like onions. We both have layers."" The film has so much funny dialogue and a great story. I find that the movie is still worth watching 10 years later."
753,Shrek,6,9 April 2011,"Far from being just another Mickey Mouse animation; Shrek is a good natured, well pitched animated film which ticks enough boxes.","Shrek begins with in a fanciful, overly romantic tone as what we assume to be an off screen narrator speaks in warm voice whilst dictating to us the words accompanying the images of your more stereotypical fairy-tale novella. After a few pages, it's revealed the narrator was, in fact, the titular character turning the pages before we hear him scoffing at such literature and verbally dismissing it as nonsense. What follows is the tearing out of a page from the book in order to use the item, now rendered a loose discarded piece of paper, for other such activities too crude to mention here; a plain-as-day rejecting of such unreal narrative notions and elements in order for other usages after the establishment that such notions do exist. While hinting at revision, one cannot deny that by the time all things have been said and done and the film has reached its emotionally charged climax, 2001 digitally animated comedy Shrek is, in hindsight, all too keen to resort to such codes in order to push home its would-be emotional drive. The film never really struck me as the great; fun-for-all; computer animated glory-fest is has done to others, but more-so as a decent adventure film with its politics all in the right place and an effective buddy comedy toing and froing between three very distinct, very irregular but highly characterised central performers.When the door to the outhouse in which the titular Shrek resides during that opening swings open revealing our lead, we get a good look at both the large green Ogre that Mike Myers voices and the sort of life he leads for the first time. Inhabiting a secluded swamp in the not so dense forest of an enchanted land, the beast has a grotesque but functioning way of living which sends up many-a human traits such as the brushing of one's teeth; preparing meals and taking showers thus burring lines between what might constitute as anthropomorphism and a character in a narrative framework you could just as easily humanify  in a world rife with both human beings and distinct fictitious, fairy-tale/nursery-rhyme characters, Shrek beclouds is the bridge between the two predominant interspecies. He lives a lonely life, but one which he very-much enjoys; a peaceful one, despite being somewhat ferocious but a functioning one despite the isolation. Early on, it's established the height he has over human-beings as well as the problems he appears to have with those of an authoritarian ilk; the fear-factor Shrek possess arriving in-tow and giving him a mark advantage over most.Around him sees a land ruled by the tyrannical, imperialist Lord Farquaad (Lithgow); a man besotted with rounding up each and every anthropomorphic character, ranging from Pinnochio to the three blind mice, that plagues his kingdom so as to place them in a ghetto-like locale which just happens to double up as Shrek's lonely pad. Farquaad inhabits a walled in central hub named Duloc, which sports a Disney World-like entrance, in which he distributes his evilness; the torturing of innocents and the ruing of not having a partner seemingly his day's norm. With the bad news dished out and a severe disrupture to Shrek's already established world looming, the ogre takes it upon himself whilst aided by Eddie Murphy's motor-mouthed Donkey, whom through one means or another stumbles into his life, to venture out and deal with this problem in the most direct and no-nonsense of fashions. However, Shrek's arrival at Duloc to see Farquaad only complicates matters when the ruler offers him the chance to rid his land of the creatures so as to retain his old ways if he so manages to bring Pricness Fiona (Diaz) back from a dragon guarded tower so as to marry him.The journey back to the kingdom following the obtaining of Fiona sees the film hint at some rather unorthodox traits that Fiona may sport, her ability to interact with the world around her in an uncanny fashion leading to later reveals. All of this gives way to the film's chief politic: that it's better to be who you are and admit to it than cover up and attempt to be somebody else, and in sticking true-to-yourself, you will eventually find more in the form of happiness than you would living a surface lie. There can be little doubt the team behind the film put an awful lot of effort into proceedings; the film sporting numerous moments that display their eye for detail, an instance in which the overly powerful lead accidentally yanks a door handle clean out of its hinges upon impatiently dragging a character from where they were in a room to the exit one of them  made even funnier when we realise that character is wittering on with poetic but humorous waffling, a slight instance which is easy to miss and yet has had precise craft to it. The film is a middling effort, a short and sharp and breezy tale of a somewhat self-centred lead operating with a free-spirited and friendly supporting character whose livelihood is itself in jeopardy; the reoccurring question as to whether the lead will be able to achieve a sort of parity as well as see the error of his ways essentially what's being tested. Its messages and ideas are explored in a routine and passable enough manner, the bulk of it fairly simplistic without exploring any particularly brilliant territory, but it isn't without charm nor some genuinely amusing or indeed heartfelt moments even if it is running on adrenalised formula."
754,Shrek,9,14 November 2010,Very Amusing!,"Shrek is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. It's up there with the wonderful Pixar films. I think this will be an iconic movie for ages to come. I didn't enjoy it that much when it first came out but that was nine years ago. Now that I saw it again, this movie is very amusing and enjoyable.This is about an ogre whose mission is to stay away from humans. When his swamp is infested with fairy tale creatures, he and his new buddy Donkey travel to a castle to rescue the Princess Fiona and take her to the Lord Farquaad in order to get his swamp back.The characters here were wonderful. My favorite character is this movie and the whole series in fact is Donkey. Eddie Murphy certainly did something right this decade. Camerion Diaz has a wonderful voice as well.Overall, this is a wonderful animation movie. The animation is beautiful and the CGI works well with the film. I rate this film 9/10."
755,Shrek,7,23 October 2010,Shrek-tastic,"Shrek tries to take apart every cliché that Disney and other animated pictures have build upon. And for the most part it works that way. Unfortunately they do not stay true to that formula, heading back and using those same clichés as the story moves along. But on the other hand, does it make this a bad movie? Of course not. And you would have to a very bitter cynic to not like it at all I guess. Or not like animated movies in the first place. Taste is different, so maybe there are other reasons too. I can only tell you, that the voice talent on hand, the animation and the story as it is, are really good. I don't like to refer to Pixar, because it is unfair to every other animated picture ... but again this does not mean I didn't enjoy it. It's a fun little picture for the whole family"
756,Shrek,10,14 October 2010,the revolution of animation,"This movie is worth watching because of a lot of reasons of which I will name a few:1 It's beautiful graphics that had never been done before in that detail.2 The story is very original.3 The comedy in the film is very good, not a lot of cheap laughs.4 The voice acting is perfect, very good choice of actors.5 Instead of watching part 2 and 3, you'd better watch this one 3 times.6 This film really is a family film (a lot of movies are placed in that genre although they really are only fun for kids)."
757,Shrek,9,12 October 2010,Great family entertainment!,"Lord Farquaad is searching for a wife. Because of a complicated situation he needs a mate so he can qualify as king of the land. The 3-foot-tall despot has already banished all the fairy tale characters from his land, resulting in a mass of familiar bedtime figures. Shrek and the obnoxious Donkey factor in when Farquaad concludes that he needs dragon-slaying assistance. The woman he wants is the beautiful Princess Fiona, who's imprisoned in a castle by said dragon. To cut a deal to keep his house, the antisocial Shrek accepts the mission, except he falls in love with the princess he's been ordered to find!""We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles!"" Since Shrek Forever After will be the final chapter in the series, I've decided to watch the past Shrek movies starting with where it all began: Shrek. The story is brilliant and original and puts a modern spin on classic fairy tales. The characters were instantly lovable and were a joy to watch, especially Donkey, who is voiced as the brilliantly funny Eddie Murphy. The voice acting was fantastic and their voices fitted the characters perfectly, the cast couldn't have been any better for their roles. The animation is brilliant with bright colours and great designs. With some hilarious scenes and funny jokes and one-liners, Shrek is a success and is definitely guaranteed to keep the kids' attention as well as the adults.I really enjoyed Shrek and I think that the writing was fantastic and it definitely achieved its target to keep adults and children happy. The jokes were brilliant and the story was great as well and I laughed all the way through the movie. Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz were perfectly cast as their characters and it was comic viewing to watch their characters. Eddie Murphy was just fantastic and memorable as Donkey and was probably the funniest in the whole movie. All in all, Shrek is a family movie that shouldn't be missed by anybody!

758,Shrek,9,21 September 2010,The male version of Enchanted,"Shrek is a 2001 computer animated comedy that tells the story about a grumpy ogre (MIKE MYERS)who lives in a swamp. He befriends an annoying ass named Donkey(the hilarious EDDIE MURPHY). As his place is under attack by some fairytale creatures like Snow White,The 3 little pigs and the bad wolf,Cinderella etc Shrek goes to Dulock to see the King Farquad who sents Shrek and Donkey off on an adventure to rescue a princess named Fiona(CAMERON DIAZ) who is actually an ogre. As Shrek saved Fiona from the guarded dragon and on the highest room in the tallest tower he begins to see a different side to her and you can tell what's going to happen. Every time I watch this movie I think of it as the male version of Enchanted as they both take the mickey out of other fairy tales like Snow White,Sleeping Beauty & Cinderella and they both contain hilarious sidekicks Donkey in Shrek and Edward & Pip in Enchanted. I loved Shrek since I first saw it back in 2001 and my favourite charcther would be Donkey or Fiona, Shrek comes in after that. I'll give it a 9/10."
759,Shrek,8,27 July 2010,The Fact That It's Been Copied Ad Nauseum Doesn't Diminish Its Freshness,"The fact that pretty much every animated film released now has a slangy and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor threatens to diminish somewhat the luster of ""Shrek,"" but people should remember how fresh and inventive this film seemed at the time of its release. It offered a new kind of animated film for adults that even Pixar hadn't yet mastered (though Pixar's level of sophistication would soon skyrocket and leave the ""Shrek"" films in the dust).Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and especially John Lithgow do terrific voice work, and the animation itself is stellar. ""Shrek"" won the first ever Academy Award given specifically for an animated feature, besting Pixar's ""Monsters Inc."" Grade: A"
760,Shrek,10,2 July 2010,ogres rock!,"I remember seeing this when was little with my family. We were on holiday in Whistable, i think it was, and it was raining so we decided to got to the cinema. We almost saw something else, but after much arguing we agreed on seeing Shrek. Now, how pleased am i that we did that?! I'd never seen a film like it, it's funny beyond belief, the characters are brilliant and basically this film is genius! Even now, years on, i enjoy getting a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar and watching shrek with my family. It's a hit with all of my family, and it's safe to say that i haven't met someone who doesn't like it. The idea of trying to find a happily ever after is something that has been played with for a long time; Only shrek, for me, does this in o convincing, hilarious way. I love ogres now. Just as well really. Because most men are ogres... Jokes!!!!!!"
761,Shrek,10,27 June 2010,Great Fairy Tale movie,"Like I said I have loved fairy tales, even as an adult. And I even don't mind a fractured fairy tale like this great film...Though I never like parody.The film is about Shrek, an ogre who likes to be alone. Until his swamp is now overrun by all manner of fairy-tale creatures, driven from their homes by the obsessive, tyrannical Lord Farquaad. Determined to get his swamp back, Shrek is given a deal by Farquaad, that he will give back the swamp if he (Shrek) goes to save Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded castle. So with a talking donkey-friend, Shrek sets out to the dragon-guarded castle to save the princess. That's all I am telling you, it would spoil things.I love it when Shrek yells : ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP?!"" And you know, Farquaad reminded me of Chronicles of Narnia's Miraz - ridding the land of all magical things. And that is all I could say about this film - it is awesome!"
762,Shrek,8,21 May 2010,Wickedly funny!,"Few films are as wickedly clever as ""Shrek,"" and even less are universally considered family films. Watching a movie this good makes us wonder why Hollywood puts out such crappy family movies that no one likes (for example, last fall's ""Old Dogs,"" which while unseen by me, was attacked by critics with viciousness unseen by anything other than a Uwe Boll movie). Whatever the reason, ""Shrek"" is a hysterical send-up of fairy tales (and just about everything else you could think of). And it's oddly touching.Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a grumpy ogre who lives alone, and that's the way he likes it. Unfortunately, one day a bunch of fairytale creatures move in...and they won't leave. After a series of hilarious plot conventions and send-ups involving a petite wanna-be king named Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), Shrek has to go and rescue a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a castle (in which, of course, a fire-breathing dragon has taken up residence) if he wants his swamp back.""Shrek"" gave birth to the never ending series of movies where the sources of comedy where potshots at pop culture, famous movies, and what not (one could argue that ""Scary Movie,"" which came out a year before, opened the door, but this film was more successful). As tired as the spoof genre became, there's a reason why it became so successful: this movie is flat-out funny! While ""Shrek"" is infamous for its jabs at Disney movies, they're not the only things in the film's cross-hairs. Everything from reality TV to theme parks is skewered mercilessly, and nothing escapes the film's grasp. What's especially funny is that it's entirely suitable for all members of the family (though some of the very young may not get a few of the jokes).The voice talents are perfectly chosen. Mike Meyers is perfect as the title character, mixing grumpiness with vulnerability, and with more than a shadow of self-doubt. Even though Meyers makes the role his own after taking it over from Chris Farley after Farley's death, Meyers still keeps a little bit of Farley's trademark energy. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Donkey, who's mouth rarely stops moving. He may not be the brightest bulb in the bunch, but he sure is funny. Cameron Diaz is no stranger to comedy, and that suits her well here as the princes that is not what anyone thinks. She's a feisty ""loaded pistol"" who's read a few too many fairy tales. John Lithgow may be the least famous member of the cast, but he's still hilarious as the arrogant (and tiny) Faarquad.Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson keep the tone light and fun, but with an air of mischief. They also take the time to create superlative visual effects. The animation is gorgeous and varied, realistic, but still cartoony. However, sometimes the lip movements noticeably don't match up to the words (like sometimes they start slightly before the words come out).Hilarious, but with a heart, ""Shrek"" is a movie for the whole family to enjoy again and again."
763,Shrek,10,12 May 2010,A wonderfully original animated film for adults as well as kids,"Utterly original, wonderful animated film, with great voice performances by Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy, written with lots of adult wit and humor. Amazing, hip use of music (including John Cale's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'- how's that for obscure?). You don't have to be a kid to love it, or have kids to rent or buy it. Charming, sweet, funny and romantic. On DVD, try and get the (now inexplicably out-of-print) widescreen version, so you don't lose chunks of the lovely visuals on the sides of the frame."
764,Shrek,8,10 February 2009,watching the first SHREK as a young adult,"I watched the first SHREK last night in over 4 years and I completely forgot of how funny this movie really is. Although I knew the plot and knew what was going to happen next, I was still laughing at almost every scene.This movie brought back my good old child memories. However, it also brought back the memories of the SHREK sequels. SHREK 2 was still very funny, but it was not as brilliant as the first. But for SHREK 3, I think that is where the whole franchise went horribly wrong.I still consider SHREK a classic movie, changing the animation genre completely. It brought a whole new audience to the genre and told people that animation is not only for little kids."
765,Shrek,7,9 December 2008,It was totally Fun and Comedy,"The movie was totally fun and comedy. Amongst the animals, Donkey was very funny. When, Shrek and Donkey are in the castle, that scene is totally thrilling and awesome. In that scene, the dragon was totally awesome and cool. Lord Farquaad looks like a pucca villain. When, Donkey is talking to Shrek at the beginning of the movie, that time Donkey is very funny. When, Shrek is fighting with the Knights, that time Shrek is totally cool. When, Fiona is fighting with the bad people, that time she is totally awesome. When, Shrek and Donkey are crossing the bridge, that scene is totally funny. The last scene is totally thrilling and funny. Even, Shrek is also funny. Even, the castle which is located in the fire is very awesome and cool. The Dragon is totally awesome in the movie. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Shrek""."
766,Shrek,10,15 November 2008,An Oustanding Film for All Ages,"This film reminds me of the classic Bugs Bunny films that were made in the 50's and 60's: they were hilarious for both kids and adults. It must be difficult to make such a film to satisfy both demographics, but ""Shrek"" succeeds in leaps and bounds.This film, unlike the one that followed, has fairly clean humor that both kids and adults will appreciate. The sequel made a reference to the Pinnochio character wearing women's underwear. I cannot see how that is funny, maybe it was inserted for the West Hollywood audience. The older, better comedians like Jackie Gleason used to say if you have to resort to blue humor, then you aren't funny. I think the writers resorted to these desperate tactics on the sequel because it just wasn't nearly as funny as the original (but yet it made more money, go figure).I think Eddie Murphy's performance made the difference of the film. His lines and his delivery were classic (""You have to warn me before you crack one off like that. I had my mouth open too""). Mike Myers was excellent too. John Lithgow's Prince Farquaad was outstanding as the diminutive, egomaniacal prince.The film was supported by the straightforward plot and the excellent musical selections, the latter which included some fairly obscure tunes that fit in so well with the storyline. The love story is sweet and simple, easy for kids to understand that physical appearances are less important than character, yet still touching for adults.Sometimes, the most subtle jokes are the funniest: as Prince Farquaad approaches the torture room, his tiny status is made apparent; when Folonius breaks the small mirror to threaten the magic mirror; the parody of Disneyland; and when Fiona pushed the wedding cake figurine of Farquaad down to its appropriate height. I also loved the ""Dating Game"" parody, a joke which was probably lost on people born after 1980. This is a classic enduring film and is definitely on my top 50 films of all time."
767,Shrek,,28 October 2008,The underdog in all of us....,"What makes Shrek ""1"" work is the simplicity, believable characters and the ability of the audience to connect emotionally (heey, there is underdog in everyone of us).Of course, saying ""reality check"" on the animated characters wouldn't be politically correct, perhaps ""parody"" sounds a good alternative. The obvious references work very well (all in good humour).The lead characters get adequate screen time and hence well etched out - Shrek, Fiona, Donkey. The me me. me. character Lord Farquaad is alright.The vintage characters are placed well (Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Gingerbread Man, Bear, Blind mice, Magic mirror, Three pigs)  the thing is that they don't go overboard. Its like ""nice to see them around"" and ""what have they been upto"" kind of feeling.And yes, the songs are quite good."
768,Shrek,8,1 October 2008,A Great central character makes Shrek enjoyable,"As a book is opened, and Shrek tells the story of a prince and a princess and utters the words ""Like that's ever going to happen"" does the film engage the audience and set the tome for a thoroughly enjoyable family adventure with good comedy, interesting protagonists and an entertaining narrative.When we first see Shrek's appearance we instantly gasp, but are instantly laughing and amazed as the credits role and observe an Ogre in his natural habitat, bathing in mud and eating gross things. This opening is very inviting and invites us into an unknown world and the life of a different character that is far from your average looking everyday hero. Shrek, a big and nasty looking man, is a symbol, an icon if you will, of defying odds and true hope. A sweet and tear jerking moment comes when he says ""They judge me before they even know me"" a real landmark for animation and appearances, and how they can be deceiving. Shrek, obviously different from other heroes, has this unique quality that makes him so likable. Despite his gross habits, we can identify with him on a personal level, being alone and at a distance from others, and this ideology of defying odds and appearances is one main reason to watch this film.Plenty of animations lie on physical comedy to entertain, but Shrek uses intertextuality to gain most laughs. Watch out for parodies of Disney classics, the matrix and others that will make you chuckle. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is by far the funniest character, being so hyper and enthusiastic that it's almost unbelievable.When we first see Princess Fiona, we are laughing by the sheer ideology of her and her long awaited rescue.Though after a while the plot becomes slightly predictable and over dramatic. However there are twists and turns in stock to keep away from the conventional narrative which is always a good thing.There are a few dry spells and the humour isn't always funny but nevertheless Shrek is one heart warming animation with a different hero whom we can all identify with."
769,Shrek,8,27 September 2008,"May have gone downhill a bit for me with my last viewing, but it's still a fine accomplishment from DreamWorks Animation","This was a very successful effort from DreamWorks Animation when it was released in 2001. I didn't go to see it in theatres, and don't think I knew about it until late in 2001, after it came into stores. I remember around then being asked it I had seen the movie, but the answer was no, I think until shortly before Christmas that year. When that happened, I remember I was not disappointed. I'm not sure whether I saw the entire thing from start to finish between then and this year, but I did so a couple nights ago (I know that was the first time in quite a while), and I don't think I liked it quite as much as before, but I think it came close.Shrek is a green hermit ogre and who lives peacefully in a swamp, and is generally feared by others in the land. However, one day, he meets a talking donkey in the forest who is running from captivity, and unintentionally saves him. After this, Donkey, who has no friends, begins to follow Shrek back to his swamp, and the ogre has finally met someone who isn't afraid of him, though the chatterbox donkey will find that Shrek is very unfriendly. That night, Donkey has to sleep outside, and Shrek soon finds that his swamp is crowded with fairy tale characters! He tells them to leave, but learns that they can't! They have been banished by the evil Lord Farquaad, and have no other place to go! So, Shrek sets out with Donkey to talk to Farquaad and get his swamp back. Farquaad wants to become a king, and plans to marry Princess Fiona, who is trapped in a dragon's castle, surrounded by lava, waiting for her true love, so he makes a deal with Shrek. If the ogre rescues Princess Fiona for him, his swamp will be back the way it was. Shrek immediately accepts, and sets out with Donkey to the dragon's castle, determined to get his swamp back, but on the way back with the princess, unexpected things happen! The last two DreamWorks Animation efforts I watched prior to watching this one again were ""Shark Tale"" (which I had seen before), and ""Madagascar"". Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, is sometimes funny, but his chattering can sometimes be a bit much, with lines such as, ""And then one time I ate some rotten berries. Man, there were some strong gases seepin' outta my butt that day!"" I may not have found the character as amusing as I did before, but the parts where he gets on Shrek's nerves tend to be good for laughs. Shrek, with a voice provided by Mike Myers, can also add to the humour, such as around the beginning with the way he suddenly appears in the presence of a bunch of hunters, talks to them about ogres, and scares them off, and other scenes where he shows his anger. The film does have some gross-out gags, including much of the opening sequence, and Shrek pulling earwax out of his ear to use for a candle. I didn't care much for those, but fortunately, there aren't too many of them. Aside from the humour, there are also some moments of excitement, including Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona running from the dragon and trying to get back across the bridge over the lava! There are also some deep, maybe touching moments, such as Shrek telling Donkey why people look at him the way they do, and the struggling romance. Last but not least, unsurprisingly, this 2001 animated feature has great 3-D animation, something I can usually say about these CGI animated films. This effort from DreamWorks Animation isn't exactly one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen, but it still has its charm, that's for sure, and I can see why it was so successful. I was a teenager (fifteen years old) when I first saw it, not long after it was first released on video, so I obviously don't know what it's like to see it as a kid. However, it seems the movie has been enjoyed by kids and adults alike, so I guess it's one of those movies. Many people have seen ""Shrek"" in the past seven years, and it seems it hasn't been forgotten, not that it deserves to be. If you still haven't seen it, but a rather humorous, clever, well-written animated feature, parodying numerous fairy tales, sounds like something that's right up your alley, and you don't mind a bit of crudeness and toilet humour, then I see no reason why you shouldn't watch ""Shrek"" the next time you get the chance, since it hasn't failed to please most people who have seen it, it seems."
770,Shrek,,6 September 2008,"Absolutely Great, Magical!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Shrek, Shrek, Shrek. What can i say? This movie is great. The characters are all CGI but it's done very well. Although the actors are limited to just voice, they do a terrific job.Especially Eddie Murphy. He is in a league of his own when it comes to comedy. He's the perfect man for the perfect job. He's the main comic relief. Mike Myers doesn't have many punchlines, but he manages to keep his character(Shrek) interesting. Cameron Diaz has done a pretty good job as the Princess. I like the film a lot and am happy that I watched it when i got the chance.Overall, a great film in many respects."
771,Shrek,9,5 September 2008,Charming fun from an unexpected hero,"Whereas Pixar always focused on good, clean family fun in its pictures, Shrek came into the spotlight because Dreamworks decided to skew the jokes a little more towards the older audience, while maintaing the basic family-friendly atmosphere. It worked, and Shrek was the film that proved it didn't take Disney/Pixar to create animated box-office gold. This first movie in the series still holds up well. Some of the pop culture jokes are instantly dated (this was done when everyone had to do a Matrix spoof), but others like the jabs at Disney are still hilarious. It helps that at its heart, Shrek still has all the usual fairy tale elements, albeit twisted. Myers, Diaz, and Murphy turn in top performances. And some of the dialogue is quite memorable (""Ogres are like onions""). The DVD has some decent extras, as well as a sampling of DVD rom games that are better than most extras of this sort. It's still not a really loaded set, but it's good for a family release and worth looking into."
772,Shrek,8,29 August 2008,Shrek,"The storyline is amazing, the dialogue is quik and witty. They have a truly allstar cast doing the voices with Michael Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and John Lithcow. Some of the scenes are comedy at its best and like the entire dragon scene and the scene in the beginning with all the faires. I must admit that I was like really unsure whether I would like this movie at all. It did not sound at all like the animated movies that I usually like to watch. But to my big surprise I love it. The music is also very good even though some of the songs are a bit cheesy. Yeah it is very different from movies like Finding Nemo, Shark Tale and the like but it is still an amazing piece of work and just as good. This movie I highly recommend."
773,Shrek,9,20 August 2008,Quality entertainment,"An excellent comedy, entertaining for kids and adults alike. There are those who have criticized ""Shrek"" and its sequels for it's crude humour, but that, to me, is where ""Shrek"" scores. Adults can enjoy the 'adult' humour while kids will just take in the visuals and enjoy the slight story as well as take in the moral of the story, which is, you can only be yourself and people will like you anyway. The joy in Shrek is not only the visuals though, but in the script and acting. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow are having fun with their roles! They clearly sounded as if they were enjoying theirselves here. Cameron Diaz, in particular, who in other movies just grates, makes a perfect anti-hero princess. John Lithgow has a great old time with his Lord Farquaad,and the sly references to Disney make this a perfect antidote to all those cutesey-pie kiddies movies we've been inflicted on in the past!"
774,Shrek,8,19 July 2008,"Hilarious, a job well done.","This is the first of the very popular and very famous Shrek films. In fact, there is about 60% chance that you - yes you, right there, have watched it already. If not, I have to tell you that you're missing out on a good opportunity for laughing your head off (not literally, obviously, or otherwise I would have killed myself about 50 times already) and entertaining yourself.If you have not yet watched this, you'll probably know what happens, anyway. There is an ogre called Shrek who is rather ugly and everyone hates him, which is not totally surprising. When every single fairytale creature (like the seven dwarfs and the three little pigs) is turned up in his swamp, Shrek decides to make sure that they leave. Along with his new companion, an annoying donkey (voiced by the very good Eddie Murphy), Shrek goes off to find the person who placed all the fairytale creatures in his swamp...Very fun for the whole family, I recommend this to EVERYONE aged 5 and above, otherwise there will be little point to watching this film (you may not get the jokes if you are under 5). Most people who have watched ""Shrek"" enjoy it and if you have not yet watched it, I hope you find it as good as I did - or better! Enjoy ""Shrek""! :-)"
775,Shrek,10,2 July 2008,An ogre- sized adventure for the ages,"An ogre-sized adventure for the ages,Shrek is one of the best animation films ever made and watching it will make you agree.It is fun not only just for kids but for the entire family.The film basically sets the story of the Shrek storyline.As the name implies,the story is about an ogre by the name of Shrek(voiced by Mike Myers) who keeps to himself until one day when another creature,Donkey(voiced by Eddie Murphy) inadvertently gets saved by Shrek when he is getting chased by minions of Lord Farquaard(voiced by John Lithgow).In order to not be bothered again,Farquaard makes a deal to Shrek: save Princess Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz) who is held captive in an abandoned castle by a fire breathing dragon.A must see film for the entire family as it had a good casting,storyline plus the film was the inaugural(first ever) winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature."
776,Shrek,9,19 May 2008,A Fun Family Film,"Shrek is fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. It takes fairy tales that people would have learn as a child and puts a twist on them and has many cultural references for children and adults. The story of the film is Shrek is an ogre living a peaceful in his swamp. However, this was going to be shattered when the evil Lord Farquaad starts rounding up fairy tale creatures and forces them onto his home. Shrek being annoyed decides to go to Farquaad's castle with the very annoying Donkey and get his swamp back. Farquaad has ambitions to be a king and to do this he needs to marry a princess. He tell Shrek that if the ogre saves Princess Fiona then he would get his swamp back. However, after saving the princess he starts to fall in love with her.Firstly the story is fun and fresh. It was the best animated film in 2001 by a small margin above Monsters Inc. Both would have been very deserving for winning an Oscar for that year. It does have homages to famous family films such as Snow White and show many fairy tales from Pinocchio, to the Three Little Pigs, to Three Blind Mice. It also has wider cultures references, such as the music used and moments such as Princess Fiona fighting Robin Hood and his Merry Men and moment copied from the Matrix. The movie was well written with some very good jokes and scenes. One scene I enjoyed was when the Gingerbread man was tortured by Lord Farquaad. The animated itself was also brilliant. The creature actually looked real and gives Pixar a run for its money. In an age where many studios make CGI films to make quick money its nice to see that this film was made with effort. This is a great film and the second is just a good, but Shrek the Third was a real let down."
777,Shrek,10,4 January 2008,The best CGI animated film period !,"DreamWork's Animation Department really showed that the talented Pixar division wasn't the only one who knew how to be creative and at the same time be the only one making massive box office hits.This film rocks and even when you get tired of it just give it a couple of months or a year and you will find something new each time.The writers and directors, most of who previously worked for Disney, are so brilliant at taking silly fairy tale concepts and making it to where the entire family can watch without being offended and having something hilarious for kids, teens and adults all at the same time.Last of all, the actors were made for these roles. I can't see Chris Rock playing Donkey as well as Eddie Murphy or seeing Tea Leoni as Cameron Diaz's Fiona. These people were well casted and obviously had a fun time being these animated favorites.If you have not seen it yet, I'm in shock!"
778,Shrek,9,1 December 2007,Shrek: a new generation of fairy tales,In a generation where Fairy Tales are not as popular as once were this movie comes out and revives it completely. The movie is about Shrek who is an ogre who sets out to get his swamp back after the king kicked all the fairy tale creatures out of the land. But when the king asks him to go and get a princess for him This leads to a fun filled adventure. The movie is good for kids and adults and is good just to get away from the world from for 90 minutes or so. Overall This movie is a must watch for the whole family. It is to be recognized as the Saviour of fairy tales and if you like this one check out Shrek 2 and 3 and also the new Shrek The Halls if you can find it. I rate this movie 93%.
779,Shrek,7,21 November 2007,A Delightful Fairy Tale,"Shrek (2001, Dir. Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson) When a green ogre called Shrek discovers his swamp has been 'swamped' with all sorts of fairytale creatures, by the scheming Lord Farquaad. With a very loud donkey by his side, Shrek sets out to 'persuade' Farquaad to give his swamp back. Instead a deal is made. Farquaad, who wants to become the King, sends Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona, who is waiting for her one true love. But once they head back Fiona, it starts to become apparent that not only do Shrek like Fiona, but Fiona is keeping something secret.What the you call this movie 'Shrek'? Is it a spoof? Is it Homage? Well, whatever is it, it's very enjoyable. Everything about the film seems perfectly crafted. The film has a large number of songs, which have been carefully chosen and suit the atmosphere at that point. The story is cleverly well written and the characters are enjoyable. The right voice talents have been brought together with a cast of characters which can really be stretched out. It's the animation which really brings his film to life though. In 2001, the animation was very impressive and still looks a treat. It doesn't look too fake and doesn't try to make it too realistic. There is so much detail in the picture which shows that the animators really spent hours working on it. 'Shrek' will last for a long time with generations of families enjoying this soon to be classic.""Chicks love that romantic crap."" - Donkey (Eddie Murphy)"
780,Shrek,9,30 October 2007,A new fairy tale,"A charming and cynical tale full to the brim with cheeky reference and cameo of other fairy tales. The Evil dragon is in fact a lonely female with needs! The Damsel isn't helpless, a Baron with size issues, contrary to popular believe you can catch the gingerbread man. Just a few of the stereotypes that are thrown away in this film, which can only serve to present an open minded view to the younger generation. It is clear that a childhood of watching Disney fairytale after Disney fairytale is mandatory for getting half the humour in this film, and even then it will probably be lost to the young, I went with my sister and 5 year old niece and it was clear she seemed to predominantly laugh at violence towards furry animals and funny faces, but I guess thats an example catering for all."
781,Shrek,10,6 September 2007,"I Loved It!  Chances Are, You Will, Too!!!!!!!!","Shrek came out when I was in seventh grade. I didn't really pay a whole lot of attention to it then, but, when I was in ninth grade I went to a football game with my band (I played the trumpet all four years in H.S.), and Shrek was being played on the bus. I fell in love with this movie instantly. Shrek, Fiona, the Donkey, and all the other characters are totally awesome. The soundtrack rocks, too! I am so much of a Shrek fan that I saw Shrek 2, loved it, and still want to see Shrek the Third. Basically, I'm like, so into Shrek it's crazy!!! Whoever came up with the idea to put all ""fairy tale things,"" as Shrek calls Tinkerbell, Captain Hook, the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf, etc., into one hilarious, funny, totally awesome movie is, like, pure genius! Whoever has not seen Shrek, you don't know what you're missing! See it once, and you'll love it, I tell you what!!!!!"

783,Shrek,10,26 August 2007,"ahhh, good times good times....","For me watching shrek is like watching my past. its so fun and enjoyable. the story is nice the characters are awesome and hilarious, and the settings are beautiful. I simply love watching this movie. the voices fit the characters completely. and the music and soundtrack is so nice. donkey is so freaking hilarious! and shrek is very relate-able. No matter how many times you watch shrek, you'll never get tired of it. like i said it reminds me of my past and i hope watching shrek will give you good thoughts and feelings when you watch it, and remember to watch it with a close friend, it'll make the experience all the more enjoyable."
784,Shrek,8,31 July 2007,Shrek - The big great Disney foe. Shrekalicious!,"After reading much good reviews about Shrek in 2001, I went to see this movie without big expectations (because when a movie get's only good newspaper reviews, it doesn't always means that it's really is a truly great movie, that's my experience). But I was wrong. This is a truly great film, but not without flaws.I really enjoyed the fun situations in this movie; Donkey, the fairy tale characters and the up side down-turned point of view of the fairy tale formula. And of course, the great and superb animation (it's a shame that Dreamworks recent animated movies doesn't have the same great animation). Donkey was no doubt the greatest character! Shrek were not the nicest guy in the town, but still not unlikeable either. Princess Fiona were a little more weaker character than the two ""lads"", but still likable. And the voice talents of the characters are doing a great job!It seems like everybody I know absolutely adore this movie and I understand why. But still I'm considering the flaws in this picture.HERE COMES SOMETHIN' THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SPOILERFirst; Shrek music theme on the movie (on the opening, who is on the audio commentary revealed as Fiona's theme); it's absolutely awful! Why did composer Harry Gregson-Williams had to compose such an awful theme? The rest of the score is not at all bad, but that theme sucked! Otherwise, the songs were great and they stays in the background of the movie. What this movie really is missing is some action sequences, because ""Shrek"" has a lot of quiet sequences, which is not bad at all, but in the length of the movie, it's getting too much of them. The third act of the movie was a little disappointing as well (when I watched it for the first time) because it's contain predictable spoilers and then the story became a totally rip off from ""The Wedding Planner"" with Jennifer Lopez. The moral is very importunate as well; We're already seen the same ""the outside doesn't matter""-moral several times before! OK, in this movie it is really emotionally told, but still...SPOILERS OVERNot get me wrong, I love this movie. It's fresh, daring and funny. It's Dreamworks real challenge tribute to Disney and it's a memorable movie, who has completely earned it's all it's good reputation. Or to say it in this way; It's shrekalicious!"
785,Shrek,9,30 July 2007,Fractured fairy tale that found an audience,"It's actually kind of amazing that this movie and the book it was based off of was actually sitting on a movie studio shelf for some years. If I remember correctly,the idea to make Shrek,a surprise 1990 children's best-seller by William Steig,was considered as far back as 1994,but was shelved for reasons that you usually hear applied to films that end up often being huge successes(i.e. ""who wants to see a movie about...?"" and ""nobody likes such-and-such type of movie""). Finally,when Spielberg-Katzenberg-Guber decided to pick it up(you might know them better as Dreamworks LLC),they assembled screenwriters Ted Elliott,Terry Rossio,Joe Stillson,Roger Schulman,Cody Cameron,CHris Miller and Conrad Vernon,and crafted a movie. With only the moderate(well,for a Spielberg-produced movie moderate)fanfare,Shrek came out in 2001. The rest,as they say,is movie history.The story is pretty well established and almost ad-rigeur. The travails of gruff-but-likable realistic ogre Shrek(Mike Myers in a modulation of the ""Mad Scotsman"" character he's used before),Donkey(Eddie Murphy in full,scene-stealing wise-ass mode)and Princess Fiona(CAmeron Diaz,easily lost,here)as they are bound to cross horns with the scheming Prince Fahrquar(John Lithgow),a Napoleon-complex inflicted royal,over the fate of the forest kingdom of Far Far Away LAnd and the swamplands(i.e.Shrek's home)are both something of wistful storytelling and current,quasi-postmodern irony and hipness. Kids and adults alike warmed up to this film and rightly so. The sequels would reach mixed reactions overall--the second would do somewhat better critically and much better financially,the third,which I haven't see yet but plan to,had grossed well but has received a much less favorable reaction from critics and many viewers alike--but would create a cottage franchise for film that isn't done continuing a rolling story(if I'm not mistaken,I believe a fourth Shrek is in the can already!). Here comes a true ""duh!"" statement of this review,but here goers:this is one unique film that is a true keeper.Perfect example of how sometimes it takes time for a unique story to find an audience."
786,Shrek,9,21 July 2007,one of Dreamworks' finest and one of the best animated family films ever made,"This is a magnificent achievement for an animated film because if you examine the basic plot and setting, it seems like a mere film made only for young children. It's a fairy tale, it's a love story, it has all of the kids' favorite fairy tale characters in it. But what it also has is the traits of a great movie that you usually don't see in an animated film like this. ""Shrek"" is full of colorful animation, the actors providing the voices are perfect in their roles, and the movie is developed and made into a way where it becomes entirely suitable for audience members of all ages. It's not too childish, but too intense and inappropriate for the children. Yet it's not too simple and immature for the older generation as well. In fact, it's not immature at all. It's just an effective film for the entire family that really works out well.""Shrek"" is also one of the few movies that fall under the comedy genre that I would really consider to be a compelling motion picture feature. Part of this is owed to its magnificent and original design of both the plot and characters. Both of them are very much like what you'd expect to see in a fairy tale, again. And they are not developed to be just heroes for the kids. And the animation fits along with the voice acting so perfectly that you don't pay any attention and think about the names of the famous actors or actresses who were simply acting everything out, only not being presented on the screen in their physical self. Some parts of the film might sound like they're just dumb or disturbing, yet when its presented before you on screen, it works out just fine.This is one of Dreamworks' finest achievements and it is truly wonderful as a film. Not just an animated film, but a film overall. Most animated films are made just for children, for it seems to have an atmosphere for them. But this is one of those occasions where it will not only suit them but also the adults, teenagers, and everybody else who sits in the theater seats, on the couch in the living room, or wherever a television is available."
787,Shrek,7,27 June 2007,hand drawn animations are now dead,"""Shrek"" came out right around the time of the movie ""Final Fantasy"". I remember because there was a newspaper article that was published menitioning the detail of the animation in both movies. I must concur with the article. I could not watch the movie without being thoroughly amazed at the physical detail of Fiona. Yeah, yeah, the movie was good too, but did you see how well they constructed Fiona? It was fantastic.Besides that, the movie had a humorous take of fairy tales. The humor was greatly assisted by the talented Eddie Murphy. As annoying as Donkey was, he was a superb addition. ""Shrek"" was good, and it is fortunate that it was good because now there is another animation outlet for the three years that Pixar takes off between movies."
788,Shrek,10,27 June 2007,Great movie for everyone!,"Let's be honest: when Shrek first came out in 2001, did anyone think that the computer animated movie would ever be nominated for 2 Oscars, and win the one of ''Best Animated Movie of the Year''? I first watched this movie as a young child, and I was surprised to find out that my parents and my aunt had liked it (I thought computer animated movies were for kids back then). But do you think that Shrek won the ''Best Animated Movie of the Year'' award because of it's gross humor (farts, burps, spitting, etc...)? I watched Shrek again just a few days ago, and I think it won the Oscar for it's originality: spoofing the well-known fairy tales you know. So all in all, Shrek is a great movie for everyone!"
789,Shrek,10,22 June 2007,Ogres are fun!,"The story of grumpy, unsocial and feared ogre Shrek, who develops a crush on a princess with a little secret.Besides being extraordinary fun, full with great characters, the story apparently also has something to say about grumpy people (pardon me, ogres) are often good-hearted in the inside, princesses are not always what they seam, and the looks are not the thing that matter.I have had the ""Welcome to Duloc"" song in my head for several weeks after having first watched Shrek 1.Not only is Duloc a perfect town, but Shrek 1 is a simply perfect animation movie. Once in a while it happens that truly deserving movies win Oscars. This has just been the case right here."
790,Shrek,9,25 May 2007,"Our hero, the ogre!","*Shrek SPOILERS* When his swamp house is invaded by creatures from fairy tales, the pacific ogre Shrek embarks on a quest to free their land and get them back there (if only to get them out of his way.) He finds out that he also has to rescue a captive princess, Fiona, and will do this with the help of a very talkative donkey and a dragoness...But we shouldn't forget the Tom Cruise-short Lord Farquaad, who has evil plans in mind, and guess who will twarth them? Shrek is a very humorous and entertaining homage and send-up to the normal animated movies (like the scene where Shrek finds that the Wolf (dressed as Grandma) from Little Red Riding Hood is in his bed), with the added bonus of having no-one suddenly burst into song.The script is pretty clever, the animation is just right, and the voices (by, among others, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy) are done really well.Finally, a good animated movie! Shrek: 9/10."
791,Shrek,9,24 May 2007,Excellent. Just Excellent,"Shrek is a big ogre who lives alone in the woods, feared from all the people in the land of Duloc. When Lord Farquaad, the ruler of Duloc, exiles all the fairy-tale beings in the woods, Shrek looses his peaceful life and his home becomes a refugees camp.So, he sets to find Lord Farquaad and convince him to take the fairy-tale beings back where they belong, and leave him alone. Lord Farquaad accepts, under one condition. Shrek must first go and find the beautiful young princess Fiona, who will become Farquaad's bride. So, the big Ogre begins his quest, along with his newfound donkey friend.This is what a good movie should be. Well, this is certainly one of the few memorable animation masterpieces ever made! Yes, I said masterpieces! I loved this movie! Not only it's good with the heart and humor for everyone to see, it also has a great story, which many animation films does not.This film is a very funny movie. It has great action scenes, although it won't beat Pixar's animation. This film has its own originality. That's how much I loved this film! Of course I can't say anything about the cast, but Eddie Murphy does make this film hilarious!With anything you want in a great movie, Shrek is one of a few which should be remembered in the past. It's one of the best movies ever made and if you haven't seen it, watch it now!"
792,Shrek,9,23 May 2007,one of the funniest animated movies ever made,"""Shrek is one very funny movie,riotously so at times.it's well written,and very well paced.if you like to laugh,you should really like this movie.the voice actors are also very suited to the characters,and the characters themselves are quite an odd crew.in all the best ways possible.the only drawback i can think of is that the film has many pop culture references as well as references to other movie.if you are not an avid movie watcher and you 're not into pop culture,some of the jokes may be lost on you.otherwise,prepare yourself for a very sore stomach as the jokes are fast and furious at times.for a change,i'm actually giving this film a higher rating(8/10) than it currently has here.""Shrek"" is a definite 9/10"
793,Shrek,10,23 May 2007,Shrek - A Movie of True Love,"Shrek, a movie with immense feeling of love, comedy, songs and you name it, it is there for your liking. Shrek for a first time watcher is a movie that can fascinate you by its sheer screen play, choreography and free flowing dialogue. An ogre who lives in a dirty swamp trying to get rid of the fairy tale creatures who have occupied the swamp due to the their eviction of Lord Farquaad goes in search for rescuing princess Fiona in order to get his swamp back. He is accompanied by the annoying talking donkey and the story unfolds when the rescued princess Fiona and shrek fall in love with each other. Eddie murphy is a perfect fit for the Donkey's voice. Right from the word go when the Donkey hits shrek in his back, he talks like a chatter box much to the frustration of shrek till the time he gets used to it. ("" For 5 minutes could you just not be yourself"" - Shrek 2)The Donkey is shrewd enough to quickly understand shrek's inferiority complex which he has developed over years as none likes him as he is an Ogre. ""It is the world that seems to have a problem with me. People give one look at me and cries. A Big, stupid, ugly ogre. They judge me before they even know me. That is why i am better off alone."" and then when Donkey replies that when he met him he did not think shrek was a Big, stupid, ugly ogre. And it was so touching when shrek acknowledges this saying "" Ya, I know"". It is a deep freindship that is shown here.Donkey more than shrek takes your heart with its friendship, his love with the dragon, his concern for his friend to win in his marriage and his appetite for being brave. A True Noble steed indeed. On a whole, Shrek is a Beautiful Love story told in a most fascinating fassion with full of comedy. A Picture Perfect in a true sense."
794,Shrek,9,20 May 2007,Fairytale Misfit,"What a hilarious rendition of classical fairy tales! This movie raves fun and humor for the entire family. It is an unexpected twist on the happily ever after movie trend. Expescially when Shrek (Mike Myer) an ogre seeking piece and quietness has his calm life interrupted by the loud mouth donkey (Eddie Murphy). Then they set out on there perilous journey to save the lovely princess from the highest tower of the highest building and enslave the dragon guarding the enchanted castle. But to everyone's surprise there is a twist. Fionna the princess also happens to be an ogre set under a terrible curse that changes her at the night-light's gleaming moon.Take a ride with this joyful movie including fairytale outcast such as the big bad wolf, the gingerbread man, snow white and the seven dwarf's. It is guaranteed to put a grin on your face"
795,Shrek,10,15 May 2007,Shrek,"Shrek is an excellent movie that I have never heard a bad thing about. It is such a funny movie that is very easy to understand and get into. Shrek is a very cute family movie and is very funny. This movie is full of different fairy tales which is a great idea. All of the characters are easy to love and laugh with. They are all such life-like characters but at the same time cartoons. This is a great movie for all different ages. Mike Myers is the perfect actor to play Shrek's roll. He is a very funny man and can make anyone laugh. Everyone is amused by Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy. There is a lot of comedy in this movie, which is why it is a different type of cartoon. Princess Fiona, played by Cameron Diaz, is a perfect fit. She is a energized and outgoing princess who has attitude, but the right kind of attitude for this movie. Shrek is a character who is wanting to be alone at the beginning of the movie when all of the fairy tale characters come to his swamp to avoid the evil Lord Farquaad. As the movie carries on, he becomes more sensible and nicer to everyone. Overall, Shrek is a great movie for all ages. There's no way anyone can go wrong with Shrek!"
796,Shrek,,21 February 2007,El Shrek,"Shrek is an outstanding movie, i saw this movie in Mexico and it was in Spanish. The voices were excellent i have never seen any movie funnier than this one. The plot really got to me and showed that the uglier you are the better when it comes to falling in love and getting a hot date. The English version was not as funny as the Spanish version. so much pressure in the air, but Shrek was up to the task. no matter how much the movie was going down, Shrek was always up to the task. Even when the lady was not happy there and she wanted him to show her love, he was right there. Shrek, however was always down for his though. Giving props to his old school crew, he was right there for adventure and making sure the lovely lady had her way. What else can i say, Shrek is really good and funny. It is good for ages of all to enjoy no matter what language it came out of."
797,Shrek,7,11 February 2007,Shrek: A rock and a hard place,"I'm not sure where I stand on this particular film. I am not a fan of Mike Myers particular brand of humour. That said I did enjoy Wayne's World. But I was younger then. Also I find Eddie Murphy particularly annoying. I guess that's why he was cast here. Leslee Feldman did a good job of putting him in the Donkey role.I do have a lot of respect for the artistry and work that goes in to all cartoons. It's a fantastic medium for story telling as the only real boundaries for expression are the animator's imagination. And this is no exception, despite my dislike for the cast I have to say the story telling and characterisation are both very, very, good, exceptional in fact.The crux of what I dislike is, conversely also what I like in it, that is the way it makes me feel. I am very much Shrek. I'm not a big green ogre though I do refer to my home as The Swamp, but that's more of a MASH reference. Like Shrek I have layers. I build walls, I push people away, especially if they look and sound like Eddie Murphy. No only kidding I liked Beverly Hills cop, so he's not all bad. Sorry I came over all Ben Elton there and digressed some what... Like Shrek I too am rather insecure and don't like the way watching myself in Shrek makes me feel. And it is that emotive stirring that makes Shrek a truly good and powerful film. There aren't many movies that reach me on an, well loathed as I am to say it, an emotional level.Freud could have an answer here. From an early age I was taught by my mother that cartoons, and especially Disney and anything Spielberg ever had anything to do with, were bad. Because and I quote: ""They have happy endings, and that's not how life is."" She was never a believer in false hope. Expect the worst and you'll never be disappointed I think is her ethos. Perhaps that's what makes me the cold hearted cynic I am today.Much as I'm loathed to admit it Shrek is a good film, despite the happy ending. Well worth a watch."
798,Shrek,7,11 February 2007,"Formulaic, but with nice touches","For all the plaudits routinely thrown as the new generation of computer-animated movies, there's a remarkably standard template that underpins them all. In the standard plot, a collection of non-human creatures of different dispositions learn tolerance and friendship through partaking in some ultimately uplifting quest, while the humour has a level of self-awareness designed to appeal to adults; and these things certainly true in the case of 'Shrek', a story about an ogre that appears to owe a substantial debt to Raymond Briggs. But the film benefits from some delightful details, and the fact that Eddie Murphy, who voices the ""annoying talking animal"" (as he describes himself in the sequel) is actually funny and not just annoying. Overall, it's less dark and subversive than 'Toy Story' or 'Madagascar' , but much more watchable than the dreadful 'Ice Age', and the standard of animation is unquestionably high. It's not my favourite film, even of its genre; but I definitely enjoyed it."
799,Shrek,10,2 February 2007,Brilliant!,"Hollywood is notorious for churning out cr*p animation after cr*p animation after cr*p animation. But occasionally, we get a brilliant animated film that raises the bar for future film-making in that area. Shrek is one of the brilliant animated films that has become one of this century's biggest icons. The rather off-beat fairytale background is one that has been used before, but never as successfully as this. Shrek and Donkey are two of the most hilarious characters I have seen - with rude senses of humour, they are definitely two animals of the screen. Perhaps the rather medieval, epic feel of the film and references to real fairytale stories were what made Shrek the success it is, but whichever way you look at it, it's still bloody good. And the sequel didn't disgrace the brilliance of this AT ALL. There's no canned laughter in this film - there's always something new to be found humour-wise. The DVD is packed with bonus features - this film is an all-round winner that deserves a place on your shelf. Filled with songs, humour, character, story and fantasy, Shrek is just one of those films that nobody can quite bring themselves to hate. 10/10"
800,Shrek,10,29 January 2007,i love this film,this film was a great help for y depression as it soothed the comedy that i needed so much in my life.I thought the use of characters in this film were very good and each and everyone of the characters made me smile.It was an incredibly enticing film that i would want everybody to watch.The best bit was when Shrek went to the toilet it was toilet humour which i love so.In conclusion i want your babies mike myers.Much love and appreciation Becki xx xx
801,Shrek,10,25 December 2006,breathtaking,"One of the top animation films in history this is truly fantastic. Eddie Murphy and mike myers both put in amazing performances as shrek and the Donkey. Set in a strange, colourful land populated by fairy tale characters, SHREK is a hilarious comedy that will win over audiences of children and adults alike. Shrek (voiced by Mike... more...Myers) is a fearsome green ogre living in isolation in his own cosy little swamp. He is not receptive to visitors, and fends off the occasional party of torch-wielding villagers with ease. But when the power-hungry Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) turns Shrek's swamp into a relocation camp for dozens of banished fairy-tale characters (including some pesky dwarfs, wolves, and fairies) Shrek's quiet, introverted life is ruined. Joined by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek makes his way to Farquaad's realm of Duloc, where the Lord promises to make Shrek an offer: He will rid Shrek's land of the unwanted visitors if Shrek will go on a simple quest to free Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from her remote, dragon-guarded castle and convince her to marry Farquaad. On their quest, Shrek and Donkey run into a number of bizarre situations, and Shrek finds himself realising that he isn't quite the fearsome monster he has always made himself out to be. Reinventing the traditional fairy tale adventure, SHREK features gorgeous computer animation, a unique sense of humour, and compelling characters--especially Murphy's lovable Donkey."
802,Shrek,8,12 December 2006,The Best Computer-Animated Film Of 2001(SPOILERS),"SOILERSI was really impressed by Shrek. I was expecting a corny computer-animated film like all the others out there, but I really like this film. It had really good jokes and a good story. It also had some big stars, like Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz. It had very good computer-animation in it. I also like all the fairy tale creatures in it.An ogre named Shrek lives in a swamp. He meets a donkey named Donkey. One day every fairy tale creature is living in his swamp. They came for they were banished by Lord Farquaad;. Shrek and Donkey go to the Kingdom to tell Farquaad that they want the creatures out of Shrek's swamp. He tells them if they can save Princess Fiona from a dragon, the creatures will go. They go on a journey to rescue her. They do. The dragon falls in love with Donkey on the way. They head back to the Kingdom. Donkey then finds out that Fiona turns into an Ogre everyday at sunset. They get back to the Kingdom. Farquaad tries to marry Fiona at sunset. Shrek and Donkey come at sunset. Fiona turns into an Ogre. Farquaad doesn't want to marry her. Shrek and Fiona kiss, and she turns into an Ogre forever. The dragon eats Farquaad.Overall, this is a fantastic computer-animated film. It has great voice-acting and a great twist on a fairy-tale. I also like the music video at the end. The only problem that I had was it got a little boring every now and then and Robin Hood was incredibly annoying. Even Donkey was painfully annoying at times. Anyway, this is a excellent film that everyone will like.8/10Recommended Films: Shrek Two."
803,Shrek,9,21 October 2006,Love/Hate relationship,"I liked this movie, and the kids just ATE IT UP! For weeks they were talking in troll accents or imitating donkey. Sadly, this movie reminds me of INTERNET TROLLS, you know, self-absorbed, self-obsessed people who are so lonesome and crave attention so like a fisherman they ""Troll for action"" by putting out their lures (rude, abusive comments, posts that start arguments just for the sake of arguments, etc.). These are sick people! Just read the comments IMDb has put out on the problem at - http://members.aol.com/intwg/trolls.htm - you will see the psychological profiles and realize how sick they are. So, sorry Shrek and Fiona, I am going to dedicate myself to eliminating Internet trolls wherever I can, by alerting the ""Powers That Be"" to their destructive, vindictive qualities, and to the damage they do to serious posters. Shrek and Fiona, you are exempt, but Internet trolls... BEWARE!"
804,Shrek,10,7 September 2006,I Want to congratulate Robert Koo for his ecellent  artistic contributions,"When I searched for Robert Koo's name I was linked to Shrek, and a few other great animated movies. This comes as no surprise to me as I am Robert Koo's grade 7 and 8 Art teacher in Toronto so very many years ago. I encouraged him to go to a high school program that had an excellent art program...that was way back in the 1970's. I moved away from that school district and on retirement from teaching was reminiscing about my whole teaching career. I searched Robert 's name because I was curious as to what happened to this very talented person. I'm pleased to see all his success stories and wanted to contact him to tell him so. The world protects these people from all the negative exposure but how about promoting the positive exposure? I'm confident that Robert would want to make contact with me after all these years. I gave him a very special fine tipped marker that as a 12 year old you would think I had given him a million dollars. I kept some of his early drawings that he did for me and would be happy to give them back to him so many years later. How do I go about getting this message to him? Sincerely Mrs Garrett"
805,Shrek,,13 August 2006,A Genuinely Funny Animated Comedy with Ambition,"Computer animation was a novelty by the summer of 2001. Pixar films were breaking records left and right. Disney's traditionally animated features after ""Tarzan"" (1999) were turning disappointing box office returns and mixed critical reviews. Other studios like Warner Bros. were out. DreamWorks had scored a good amount of hits prior to ""Shrek"". ""Shrek"" was their first computer animated film since the critically praised ""Antz"", and it was a film that was remarkable.Being a huge Disney (and Pixar) fanatic, I think it's nice to see competition. Disney can't always rule the roost. That would be like saying Spielberg should rule the roost at Hollywood, or anyone else. Despite a very troubled production history and the fear that it would be a bust, ""Shrek"" is an animated classic.At heart, ""Shrek"" is a comedic spoof of Disney's adaptations of fairy tales, and it does it well. But, ""Shrek"" has a strong story and great characters. It was a very competent film for its time (And more competent than any other DreamWorks animated film today) and it was an alternative to Disney and Pixar. Unfortunately, I feel that ""Shrek"" can't match the sheer genius of the Pixar films. But it outdoes some of the modern Disney animation efforts.But enough of the Disney comparisons, even though its highly inevitable. The title character is a funny and also grumpy character. He hates being disturbed, especially by mobs. The worst happens when he's accompanied by Donkey. Donkey, being an obnoxious character, is the perfect companion for the grumpy ogre. The duo work perfectly.Pretty soon, they are sent on a quest to rescue Princess Fiona from the villainous Lord Farquaad. Farquaad was a great villain, who was funny and menacing at the same time. He was basically a little guy with a complex. He was perfect. Aside from the main characters was a hilarious supporting cast. Gingy, the Mirror, the Dragon and the other fairy tales characters were all likable. No uninteresting characters or anything.The use of songs worked quite fine, and it strengthened the romance between Shrek and Fiona in the second act of the film. The idea of Fiona secretly turning into an ogre at night was also a great subplot, as it is implied throughout the film until we actually see it. The action scenes were great, from the castle scene to the final battle, ""Shrek"" delivers in that department.The animation was also very good, and stylized. It still looks fine today. There's a great attention to detail in this film. While the Pixar films have stylized humans (Nothing wrong with that), ""Shrek"" shows humans that look more realistic. But they don't look ""better"" than Pixar's humans, as Pixar does caricature with their human characters.As an animated feature, ""Shrek"" succeeds. It's funny and heartfelt at the same time. Some minor flaws are the use of pop culture jokes, but they are mostly subtle. Sometimes the film gets a little ahead of itself, but that's only a minor issue I had with the film. Otherwise, it was a fine animated film that was very competent and tried to get more adults into animation. Unfortunately, DreamWorks basically gets cocky about animation because this film was what really launched them in the animation industry. Aside from all of that, ""Shrek"" will still be an animated classic.A 9.5 out of 10."
806,Shrek,10,24 July 2006,A Classic Twisted Fairy Tale,You can name Austin Powers and Wayne's World from Mike Myers. You can name The Golden Child and Eddie Murphy Raw from Eddie Murphy. Now they both are in a kids movie named Shrek. It is a great movie. Shrek is a classic all the way. An ogre falls in love and his friend is a donkey that won't shut up. It is a great wonderful and original movie. It is refreshing from all those old Disney movies. This really has a funny background to it. It has two Saturday Night Live breakout performers in Murphy and Myers. Cameron Diaz also hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live before. This is the first of 3 Shrek movies and this one will always be my favorite one. The wrestling scene is the best when he if fighting the soldiers. John Lithgow also stars in this wonderfully twisted fairy tale.
807,Shrek,8,10 July 2006,Great movie for kids and adults alike.,"Shrek tells the story of a hideous ogre who lives in a swamp, happy to be alone. When the evil Lord Farquaad evicts all the fairy tale creatures (including Pinocchio and the 3 Little Pigs) from his land, they go to Shrek's swamp. Lord Farquaad tells Shrek that he'll remove the creatures if he can defeat a dragon and rescue a stranded princess. Shrek sets out with a talking Donkey to rescue the princess, but ends up in a series of misadventures. Shrek is a great movie because it appeals to both kids and adults.Shrek attracts children because it has a bevy of fairy tale characters that they will recognize including everybody from the 3 blind mice to the Big Bad Wolf. All of these characters in one film will surely keep your child happy. It appeals to adults because some of the humour is adult oriented, but it is just over your child's head, so you don't have to worry. Also, the movie has a fairly good story, so it's not one of those preachy kids' movies.The voice talent is very talented here. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are hilarious together, and John Lithgow doesn't need his face and body to be on screen for his great acting to show through.Overall, this is a great movie that adults and kids can enjoy together.8/10"
808,Shrek,6,7 May 2006,"Beautiful animation, performances. second film is better","'Shrek' is a beautifully-animated film about an ugly troll (Shrek) who learns how to find an inner beauty during his adventure rescuing a beautiful princess. The film is witty, bringing together several voice talents which bring the characters to life and create an interesting fairy-tale story involving several fairy-tale characters. While the animation and the characters are done very well, the story itself seems a little weak and slow in places. There is a lot of humor in the story, but this often got annoying and distracted from the story. In my opinion, the second film is much better than this one, but this one should be enjoyed by children (and adults), and it does have some good lessons. I give this film slightly above average because the animation is good, and the performances are done well."
809,Shrek,10,17 April 2006,funniest line,"I just love it!I mean...how can you not?It's best animated movie ever and hilarious like no other!There are so many funny lines,just to mention a few:""If you see a tunnel,stay away from the light!""or ""After all this i'm gonna need a therapy!Look at my eye twitching!"".The funniest line in the movie is when donkey, sitting on a back of his dragon,says:""I have a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it!I'm a donkey on edge!!!""I have watched it a zillion times and just can't get enough of it!!It's great! And there are bunch of spoofs and pranks on Disney characters!!Not that I have something against Disney, but it's funny to watch them again in a little bit different surroundings.I seriously recommend watching this movie and 2nd part also!Can't wait till Shrek 3 comes to theaters!!"
810,Shrek,8,10 April 2006,A pretty good movie with good animation and excellent characters  - but it's not quite top 250 material,"Don't get me wrong, Shrek is a pretty good movie. But in my opinion, it is overrated. It is in the Top 250, although I do not think that it deserves to be there. Shrek has got good animation and decent characters, but it meanders a bit in the middle and it is outdone by its sequel. Nevertheless, it is a nice romantic tale which involves Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona and Lord Farquadd. Shrek is a stereotypical ogre at first glance: ugly and unpleasant, but he is a complex character and is decent deep down - a bit like Nelson Muntz if you ask me. Mike Myers does a good Scottish accent too by the way. Donkey is FUNNY - Eddie Murphy brings out the best in him and acts with a viguor not seen since Beverly Hills Cop. Cameron Diaz plays Fiona like she should - tough and bitchy, yet soft and fragile at the same time. John Lithgow, as always, makes for a strong villain (see Cliffhanger), as he plays Lord Farquadd with the right amount of menace - even if there are constantly clever puns made at his expense, such as: ""There are those who think little of him."" This odyssey all starts when Shrek wishes to evict fairy-tale creatures from his land; however, in the process he ends up rescuing a princess. He is unwillingly accompanied by a talking Donkey, who constantly shows off his verbal ability. Like I said, its a good plot and the fairy tale creatures add a bit of life to proceedings, but it meanders a bit. The animation is pretty good - not up to Pixar's standards, but arguably Dreamwork's best. Too bad they have regressed over the years to making unpleasant-looking stuff like Shark Tales.In the end, Shrek is comfortably above par for an animation film. It is not quite excellent, however, and does not really deserve to be in the Top 250, alongside better movies - like the two Toy Story's for example. It also pales in comparison to it's sequel. Still, see this, then go see Shrek 2 to get the most out of this trilogy - whether you are young or old.4/5 stars"
811,Shrek,,5 January 2006,Watch Shrek for fun,"Shrek is the best movie to watch. You can't miss the must-see movie. Dream Works has done a great job in animation of green ogre, swamp and every other thing!!! Shrek voiced by Mike Myers and Donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy go to rescue princess from the highest tower surrounded by the evil dragon. Shrek is doing so because he wants his swamp back which is now been filled with fairy tale creatures. Watch King Farqua as the villain who sends the Shrek and Donkey on their mission. The real fun in this movie is the irony made by ogre and donkey who have exceptionally comic minds. I think Shrek is far better than than the Shrek 2 even it has hit the all time box office."
812,Shrek,10,6 August 2005,Great Film!,"OK then, So we don't think its so good but I cant get my little baby cousin away from the TV with it on. Shrek is a amazing funny film.Donkey is funny as! I like the film personally but it would have been a bit better if Shrek didn't get upset when he thought Princess Fiona was talking about him. that was quite upsetting. The father of Princess Fiona was a bit mean. He told everyone what to do. He shouted at Shrek lots of times as soon as he met him he was too over-powering. Well you don't see much of donkeys last owner. She could have done a lot more which would make it funnier. Whoever made this film is great. Well Shrek was kinda funny but not as funny as donkey. Donkey was the star of the film i think."
813,Shrek,10,25 July 2005,"You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.","You can do smartass humor or be poignant, but it's tough to do both in the same hour and a half. The only movie I can think of that pulled it off is Mr Roberts.And then came Shrek, which uses pages from a bona fide book of fairy tales as toilet paper, shows the hero taking a slime shower and has maggots wriggling into place to create words  and that's only through the opening credits. Yet, after all that, and the candle made of ogre earwax and a donkey urinating out a campfire, it still manages the most poignantly beautiful scene ever committed to film as the hero and heroine contemplate their lives without each other to the accompaniment of Leonard Cohen's haunting Allelujah.Mike Meyers as the title ogre, Eddie Murphy as his talking donkey sidekick, Cameron Diaz as the enchanted princess and John Lithgow as the vertically challenged villain are all brilliant. The script and direction match their efforts. The animation is simply the best ever done (even to the point of replicating the red-point sun reflection off the camera lens as the heroes emerge from a tunnel). Fantasia eat your heart out.And it isn't just that this is the comedic equal of Arsenic and Old Lace and Young Frankenstein. Or that it is to animation what Citizen Kane was to cinematography. Or that, while creating the greatest of all fairy tales, it lampoons every one that came before it along with the Disney machine that put most of them on celluloid. It's greatest strength is that it's as societally important as Mr Smith Goes to Washington or To Kill a Mockingbird. Not all of us, in fact not many of us, grow up to be swans, and there's not a damn thing wrong with being an ugly duck.Shrek is irreverently funny in a way that delights everyone from bratty kids to insensitive old farts. It's scenes that attempt romantic beauty are the equal of any classic Disney fairy tale. It's message is the most important ever delivered by any story: no matter who or what you are, there's a place for you in this world and you have a right to be happy being you."
814,Shrek,10,10 July 2005,somewhere ogre the rainbow...,"In my opinion, ""Shrek"" benefits more than anything from not being a Disney movie. Never too ""cute"" to the point where you feel like there's a drill in your head, and never too gross to the point where you feel nauseous, it's what a family movie should be.Mike Myers voices the title character, a foul-tempered ogre whose lifestyle is interrupted when the lascivious Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) throws all fairy tale characters onto his property. Among these is motormouth Donkey (Eddie Murphy). So, Shrek and Donkey go to Lord Farquaad's castle, where they get the assignment of finding Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) for Farquaad to marry. But things don't turn out quite like anyone would just assume.What's particularly great about this movie is the way almost every scene is a popular culture reference, such as Princess Fiona fighting a la ""The Matrix"". But overall, ""Shrek""'s moral is that we shouldn't judge people by how they look. I know that it sounds pithy, but they did a good job with it. If absolutely nothing else, you'll die laughing at how Donkey talks.Oh, just one more thing. Something else that makes ""Shrek"" especially good is how it ended up clobbering ""Pearl Harbor"" at the box office in summer, 2001. That's just a side note, but I still consider it neat."
815,Shrek,9,17 June 2005,"Good movie, but too crude.","Do I have to write anything more than the title? I enjoyed the movie--I thought it was hilarious, the way they spun off on the regular fairy tales and ogre images. The animation was stunning, the characters fleshed out very well, and the story was most impressive. If it weren't for all of the crude ""humor"" and sexual references, I would have loved it. But, when Mike Myers is involved, civility goes out the window. I must say that I loved all of the twists and turns in the movie...and Donkey was hilarious, even if he was a bad sign from the start. Eddie Murphy certainly did better than Mike. I give it a seven out of ten--a C, but a middle C. Amusing yet offending...I have the same misgivings about the sequel, but I want to see it.""One of a kind!"" --Shrek"
816,Shrek,8,20 May 2005,"Touching love-story -- similar to ""Beauty and the Beast""","This state-of-the-art animated fantasy film is great family entertainment. The story is quite similar to ""Beauty And The Beast"", with a beautiful ""fairy tale ending"". At the very end of the DVD there is a bonus of about 5 minutes of ""Kareoke"" fun, featuring samplings of many well known Rock Songs, Oldies, even Motown Classics. I showed the DVD to my class of 4th-graders, who absolutely loved it! My only complaint is the fact that many jokes were included that were either ""over kids heads"" or just not quite rated G. Even Eddie Murphy could tone it down for a kids film. The constant blah blah from the donkey character becomes tiresome quickly. Hold the babble water! Aside from these minor blemishes I give ""Shrek"" 2 thumbs up!****"
817,Shrek,9,2 May 2005,Awesome Movie,"Kay,once again I thought this wasn't going to be a movie worth watching from seeing the previews but then my friend invited me to see it with her and actually seeing the movie proved me wrong.Shrek,as the tag line states:The greatest fairy talk never told.Shrek is about an ogre named Shrek who's independent,intimate and a complete slob for an ogre.All Shrek wants to be is alone in his home which is located on the swamplands.He doesn't care what others think of him and will do anything and I mean ANYTHING to keep anyone off his property.One normal day,Lord Farqua,a vain and self-centered prince orders his guards to put the fairytale creatures(Pinnocio,Three Little Pigs,etc)in cages unless they are unique then they will award them money.A woman brings a donkey who she claims has the ability to speak and is rewarded tons of money if she can prove it.When the donkey doesn't speak,the guards begin to take her away until the donkey speaks and reveals to be quite a chatterbox.The donkey is on the run until he runs into Shrek who scares off the guards which is officially when the talking donkey became Donkey to the viewers.Shrek isn't exactly happy when Donkey begins to follow Shrek back home because he has no where else to go.Not soon after,all the fairytale creatures uncaptured have escaped to Shrek's land and won't leave unless Lord Farqua lets them all live in peace again.Shrek then journeys to Lord Farqua's kingdom to compromise a trade:Shrek does something for Lord Farqua and he brings harmony back to the lands.Farqua wants Shrek to journey to a castle guarded by a fearsome dragon where Princess Fiona,the woman Farqua wants to marry is trapped.Shrek does as he says and goes to the castle along with his new companion Donkey to save Fiona and have his swampland back.However,Shrek gets more out of his journey then just his life back.He finds new friendships,a great adventure and a deep romance with Fiona.This movie was fantastic.Shrek and Donkey make the perfect comic duo in the whole movie.Fiona provided laughs as well.The parts when she fought Robin Hood's crew was hilarious and well animated.I never did expect Fiona to actually be an ogre too.The ending was cool with Donkey singing I'm a Believer along with the other characters playing the instruments.The karaoke at the very end was hilarious and enjoyable for audiences of all age.The lines were cleverly written and the animation was superb.I rate this movie a 9/10."
818,Shrek,8,30 April 2005,"Never Gets Old, Fun For Everyone","Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is an unwanted, hated ogre that lives deep in the forest. But soon his quiet, secluded life is disturbed when heartless ruler, Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) when an law is passed to remove all fairy creatures and dump them in Shrek's swamp. While in this chaos, Shrek meets Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) and reluctantly sets off on a journey to Lord Farquaad's palace to get the creatures moved. After an encounter with soldiers in Farquaad's Disney-designed palace, he is told that they must go on a journey to retrieve Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) from a castle so Farquaad may marry her. This is the only way Shrek may get his swamp back.Shrek, the film, is filled with Disney characters such as Three Blind Mice, Sleeping Beauty, Pinnochio, and Robin Hood (I'm not sure if he is a Disney character or not). Shrek, the character, is voiced by Mike Myers in a Scottish accent and is funny as the over-sized, green ogre. Donkey has the most laughs in the film, he is filled with comedy and is visually amazing with the design of massive castles, a fire-breathing dragon who falls in love with Donkey, and Shrek's unique hut.Most of the jokes are tended towards kids with a few adult jokes (Fiona fighting off the Merrymen Matrix style) and the film is a great for family audiences. Mike Myers goes from his goofy roles in Austin Powers to an angry, Scottish ogre whose best friend is a talking donkey.Shrek. Starring the Voices of: Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, and John Lithgow.4 out of 5 Stars."
819,Shrek,10,6 August 2004,Great,"The story is about an ogre who's called Shrek. Shrek lives alone in his own swamp in peace. Sometimes people from the village come and tries to make him go away. In the other side of the woods the prince Lord Farquaad of Duloc tries to collect all the fairytale creatures because he want a clean country. From Lord Farquaad guards a talking donkey escapes and meet Shrek. In the middle of the night all the other fairy tale creatures escape too. So Shrek and the Donkey takes a mission to get back Shreks swamp from Lord Farquaad, so they set their way to Duloc. When they enters Duloc Farquaad says that if they want the swamp back they have to get him a princess. The princess' name is Fiona. And now Shrek and Donkey are on a new mission to get the princess...."
820,Shrek,,7 September 2003,"It was good the first time around, but it sucks once you see it again and again","This movie is indeed one of those movies where it was good when you first see it, but as you see it more and more, the humor and magic of this movie goes away quickly. In other words, let's say you make up a very funny joke. As you say it to a crowd of people, they will laugh out loud because of the joke. Then, you say the joke again and again. As you say the joke more and more, the less funny it becomes. Another example is a piece of gum. As you chew it longer and longer, it loses its flavor. That is the case with this movie. This movie beat the Rugrats Movie and Prince of Egypt as biggest-grossing non-Disney animated movie. I don't need to say the story, since everybody saw the movie. When I saw the movie the first time around, I laughed out loud at the gross-out and spoof humor (like the opening intro and the It's A Small World spoof), and it had a message. I wound up seeing the movie a second time. It was still OK. I saw it a third time and a fourth time. It lost its flavor then. I give this a 5 out of 10. It's not that the entire movie sucks in general. The case is that the movie is good the first time around, but as you see it more and more, it runs out of gas."
821,Shrek,10,30 October 2002,Greatest Movie EVER Made,"I am an adult.  I have always enjoyed such movies like Toystory and more recently liked the way they made Scooby Doo.  The animation mixed with human interaction in Scooby was second to none.  Although, I do believe the animation in Shrek was outstanding.  Probably the best I have ever seen. Great on the big screen, but better on DVD.  Where you actually notice all the little things.I have probably watched this movie about 50 times, and each time something new catches my attention. Probably the greatest MOVIE ever made."
822,Shrek,10,28 August 2002,Top class contemporary animated comc fairy tale spin!,"This is a brilliant comic animated fairy tale, with terrific sight gags, rich detailing, and a light twisted sense of humor.  This is professional contemporary entertainment as its most wonderfully creative best.  The voice characterizations are superb, especially the leads of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow & Cameron Diaz.  The graphic work is breathtaking and the storyline is a wonderfully new interpretation of some classic tales.The big question now is why is animated storytelling doing so well?  I think the reason is that it hasn't yet been subjected to the rigorous critical scrutiny (so far) that professional live-action storytelling has become.  I personally think that live action (especially drama) is so ruthlessly dissected and analysed, that you get the impression the characters can't move an inch without some ""expert"" trying to read some deep symbolic significance into it.  And I get the feeling to a certain extent that this is hampering the creative work that great storytelling can do.With the fresh new computer-animated films however, this is not such a problem (yet!).  The form is so free and innovative that the characters can ""break the rules"" and get away with it.  (They can even overplay to the hilt and display some rich parody and it actually works--which live-action isn't allowed to get away with anymore.)Maybe in a year or so some dramatic scholar is going to write a big dissertation on how animated films ""should"" play, and will probably kill off all the fun and personality out of the storytelling.  Until then, perhaps we should enjoy these stories while they last."
823,Shrek,10,24 August 2002,the best and most colourful 3-D movie ever!,"I watched Shrek yesterday and I can freely admit that it is the best 3-D movie ever! All the characters are excellent.Mike Myers gives a semi-take on his Fat Bastard and Stuart McKenzie(So I Married An Axe Murderer) characters as the ogre, Shrek. Eddie Murphy is by far the best character in Shrek, as the motor mouth Donkey. Cameron Diaz(Princess Fiona) gives a good spin on the average fairytale princess. John Lithgow is the best enemy that could have been picked and I hope he returns in the sequel. I just hope they don't do the Toy Story 2 on the sequel and make it a sappy,overdrawn presentation squarely aimed at children."
824,Shrek,10,24 August 2002,BEST DISNEY MOVIE ACTUALLY BEST MOVIE IN HISTORY!!!,"I absolutely love this movie, it tops all of my other favorite movies. It is hilarious, i rent it every single time i go to the video store and never ever get sick of it, I have probably spent 200 dollars all together on renting this movie, i am gonna buy the dvd soon though. anyway if you havent seen this movie before, you have to see it immediately!!!!"
825,Shrek,10,27 July 2002,Wow!,"What a movie!  A beautiful fairy tale, fairly good graphics (and I usually hate CGI), funny jokes, funny references (I especially like the references about Disney World).  Plus, the movie has an excellent soundtrack. Children and adults can love this movie."
826,Shrek,7,27 July 2002,"Great, but with some tasteless moments for a kids flick","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, even when the demographic button pushing was blatant. What I don't understand are moments such as a singing bird exploding, which dropped the jaw of the 7-year old girl next to me. They could've toned that one down a bit for the kids. Still, aside from a few snippets of modern Hollywood insensitivity--a very enjoyable movie."
827,Shrek,10,29 July 2002,Pure Comic Genius - One of the funniest films of all time.,"Has to be one of the greatest comedies ever. The fairly simple story of a fairy tale gone disasterously wrong is filled to the brim with humorous touches, rib-splitting dialogue and wacky slap-stick.Each actor is amazing in their voice roles, clearly all enjoying themselves. Mike Myers is a revelation as the scottish sounding Shrek, John Lithglow plays it up gloriously as the selfishly evil Farquad, Cameron Diaz is the not so princess-in-distress Fiona. And Eddie Murphy? He gives the performance of his career. As the animated Donkey, I have literally never seen (should say heard) him funnier. He literally makes the movie. He definitely brings all the characters together!The animation is beautiful to behold. The environments are realistic and always stay in the background, never too distracting, letting the characters stay at the front of the picture (unlike other computer animated attempts like Final Fantasy). The characters themselves are on just the right side of cartoon and realism, another balance thats rare these days.But its not the amazing animation that makes this film, it really is just the script. For lack of better words, its as funny as hell. From the opening credits that sees Shrek going about his normal routine, to the rib-splitting hilarious closing scene of the swamp kareoke (which is worth admission price alone), this is one constant laugh. Live action films would love to be this funny. What really makes this film enjoyable isn't that it is extremely funny, but that it is CONSTANTLY funny. It doesn't just have its great moments. All the moments come together so well that the whole movie is one great moment. And thats what makes it stand out. Take any scene, any one scene from this film, and it will have 5 laugh out loud moments, hundereds of background jokes and this never lets up, throughout the whole film.It does have more, the adventure and action is well timed and shot, the music is excellently placed, but thats not what this film is about. Its there to make you laugh. And it succeeds. More gloriously than it has any right to."
828,Shrek,8,28 July 2002,An instant Classic,"A very good movie.  I like the Rest of the world was attached to thid comedy delight by the animation for the kids and the humor not exactly for the kids.  It was fun to watch and The Donkey was hilarious even though it was Eddie Murphy (maybe it was good because you couldnt see him).  and Mike Myers is funny as well as the wonderfully yet verticallyu challenged Lord Farquadd as voiced by John Lithgow.  The adventure was great and the animation was not too shabby. dont bother renting this if you havent seen it.  Go straight to the ""for sale"" shelf and grab it there, it is amusing even the 198th time. (I havent really watched it that many times).8/10"
829,Shrek,,27 July 2002,The best Animation film ever!,"I would have to say that ""Shrek"" is the best animation film I've ever seen. I say that because the computer graphics were really well done and the story was very good. It had a lot of good jokes and funny humour. I especially like the voices who were in it like Mike Myers, Eddie Murphey, and Cameron Diaz. They were good as those voices in ""Shrek"" I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel to this film, hopefully it will be just as good as the first one, or maybe even better. I give this film an A+"
830,Shrek,,18 July 2002,Cool and cute,"I loved Shrek! It was so cool! This movie is definitely one for the whole family! My parents really liked it and so did my brother and sisters. Shrek is an excellent mixture of comedy, romance and action. So it's the perfect movie for everyone. I thought the voices were really good too - they chose the perfect people (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz). I also liked the fact they made the characters look so real, especially Princess Fiona. She wasn't exactly perfect, but she looked so cool and real. And Shrek, too. Donkey looked like a donkey, so I guess they did well there. Basically, this is a super movie and should be seen by everyone!"
831,Shrek,8,17 July 2002,A winner with an all-star cast!,"Shrek is a  movie sure to please all ages, and sure to make you laugh! Funny funny funny! My favorite part(s) are the fairy tale scenes where all of them are bothering Shrek. Then there's the dance party at the end, but can only be seen on VHS and DVD (not in theathers) See this movie and laugh at Mike Myers(Austin Powers) Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels) John Lithgow (3rd Rock from Sun) and Eddie Murphy (Dr. Dolittle)"
832,Shrek,,14 July 2002,Quite funny.,"May contain spoiler.Shrek is a movie that is a rare gem. It features many parodies of well known fairy tales and some fairy tale creatures itself. In the process it is hilarious. In this story a reclusive ogre named Shrek meets with a donkey who is just referred to as ""Donkey"". Donkey talks Shrek into staying with him for a night then that night fairy tale creatures are dumped into Shrek's swamp. He then goes on a quest to see Lord Farquad to give him his swamp back. BUT he must do something for Farquad first. With superb animation and the voice talents of Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, John Lithgow, and Eddie Murphy this movie is just plain fun!"
833,Shrek,10,8 July 2002,A+ MOVIE!!,"I can't tell you how many times I have seen this movie in the last couple of months!  It's funny, yet serious in some aspects.  You can watch it over and over picking up little bits and never get bored!!! :)  For someone that doesn't buy DVDs that often, this one is a gem!"
834,Shrek,8,4 July 2002,The greatest animated movie ever.,"Some of the funniest people put together in what is most definitely the greatest animated movie ever. Eddie Murphy steals the show as the talking donkey, and Mike Myers stars as the lonely ogre Shrek. Definitely a movie for all ages to see, not just kids."
835,Shrek,10,30 June 2002,to be enjoyed by all,"what a crowd pleaser, what i have noticed is the remarkable sensation that the young and the old get when watching this film. It is a very humorous story with action and plenty of eye candy. For those of you that dont like animation, live a little."
836,Shrek,10,22 June 2002,Great flick!,"Yeah, isslike, I love this movie ovah here.  It's pretty good and all, but the moral kinda confuses me -- isslike, I thought it was gonna be about acceptin' othah peoples' differences, but isslike, it just says that ugly people will find othah ugly people.  Man, I dunno if I like that ovah here. A-uh-huh."
837,Shrek,,19 June 2002,Very funny! Great movie!,"The first time that I saw this I didn't know what to think. It was funny, but what was it supposed to be? After viewing it a second time, I now realize that this movie is great. All you have to do is take it for what it is, a spoof on fairy tales. If you do that, then you will have a great time watching this. Just like I did. There are so many funny scenes in this. I won't tell you any, becuase I really don't want to spoil anything. I think that the best aspect of this movie is that it appeals to all age groups. It is appropriate for kids, but it also has some hidden jokes that the adults will enjoy. The Computer animation is great, and I think in some cases rivals Toy Story. The casting was great too. I think that it was dead on! The actors are definately suited for their roles. All in all this is a great and funny movie that the whole family will enjoy. I really think that you should all go and see, no all go and buy this right away! It is that good. I don't think that you will be disapointed. 10/10 GREAT!!!!"
838,Shrek,,12 June 2002,The BEST animated movie yet.,"This is the movie that Disney doesn't have the guts to make. It takes every fairy tale cliche and rips them wide open. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy give bravura performances as the voices of Shrek, the Princess, and the Donkey respectively. When I first saw this film, I couldn't stop laughing until the closing credits started running. I have seen thousands of animated movies (especially Japanimation (also called Anime)), but none has made me laugh as hard or for as long. The best cliche-bashing comes from John Lithgow who voices Lord Farquaad. Talk about over-compensation, WHEW! He plays the part so straight it would give you a stroke to try to keep from laughing at him. I have seen this film several more times since...and I STILL laugh hard every time I see it. This film is fun for everybody.In my opinion, this is a must-see film. Whether you are five or fifty-five, you will find something to laugh at. A note on the sequel: If it is at least HALF as good as the original, it will still be GREAT!"
839,Shrek,,8 June 2002,Good film - but why oh why the accent?,"First of all, Shrek is a great film, it's original, and there are scenes that should have you laughing out loud. Of course there are the 'kid's' jokes and the 'adult's' jokes, in a combination that does work. What I don't understand is why Mike Myers feels he has to do a 'Scottish' accent. It's not obligatory for him to do British accents in all his films.
Eddie Murphy, however, is brilliant, and this is of course helped by the fact that he gets all the best lines. He and John Lithgow make up for Myers' slightly odd dialect. I would definitely recommed this film."
840,Shrek,10,2 June 2002,Hilarious,"I think this was an excellent film. It was extremely funny. I love the voices and how it used a song by Smash Mouth ('cause they're one of my favorite bands). I have to say, this is one of the best films of the year."
841,Shrek,,28 May 2002,pleasantly surprised,"Normally, I don't care for children's movies, especially animated ones. But this movie has elements for adults as well. It's fairly entertaining and there are some funny moments.  The graphics were cool too. I really liked the dragon and the castle she lived in. Eddie Murphy was great as  Donkey. His voice was perfect for him. Eddie should stick to doing voice characters. Final Verdict:  It's worth renting, even if you don't have kids."
842,Shrek,10,26 May 2002,Ogres are like onions...,"If you haven't seen Shrek, run out and do so right this minute. I'll wait.Ok, you've seen it now? Good. Didn't you enjoy yourself? What was your favorite part? I don't know that I can actually pinpoint a favorite moment in the movie. I think the reason I like this movie so much (aside from the gorgeous animation) is how irreverently fun it is. This movie pokes fun at nearly every fairy tale held sacred by our society, and does so with unabashed glee.Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a big, surly, anti-social, unfriendly ogre. Oh yeah, and he's green. Shrek would like nothing better than to live in peace in his swamp shack, but finds that his routine is shattered by an influx of displaced fairy tale characters, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a small, grey, outgoing, talkative, well... donkey. Shrek sets off to find the source of the sudden flood of fairy folk into his realm accompanied (much to his dismay) by Donkey.As part of a bargain with Lord Farquaad of Duloc (John Lithgow), Shrek is tasked with rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the obligatory dragon. Unable to shake his donkey companion, Shrek heads off to fulfill his half of the bargain. All sorts of merriment ensues, and romance and surprises are at every turn.The phrase ""for kids of all ages"" may be old and trite, but it describes this movie to a T. There's plenty of overt humor and pratfall silliness (not to mention bright, colorful animation) to fill any youth with glee, but the movie also has much to offer the adult viewer. Subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to other fairy tails, the aforementioned gorgeous animation, and humor abound."
843,Shrek,9,23 May 2002,Other Children's Films Shoud Be Green With Envy After This!,"Ahhhhhhh!!!! Shruks! I am mad at myself for waiting this long to see the fun-filled witty film `Shrek'. I guess i should have listened to all you `shrekies' that told me this computer animated gem about an ogre & a donkey on a mission to rescue a princess was filled with witty dialogue, vibrant voiceovers, and innovatory storytelling.   This is one for sure to be a classic for all kids & adults alike! Actually, I even think it is more enjoyable for adults than it is for kids! I think the `ogre' you get, the more you will enjoy the beauty of `Shrek'. If you have not seen `Shrek', then you are missing one great `all-star' film that will make you `a believer' that children's computer animated films are just as enjoyable for adults as they are for kids. So please check `Shrek' out! ***** Excellent"
844,Shrek,9,18 May 2002,Funniest Cartoon Ever,"There are only about 3 animated flicks that I enjoy. Of those 3, I like SHREK the best (the other 2 are FANTASIA and ROBIN HOOD). The CG for this movie was fantastic, and Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy were at the top of there game. I'm going to go beyond calling this the most hilarious animated feature, but I think this is one of the funniest films that I have seen. Ever."
845,Shrek,10,17 May 2002,"A fantastic, marvellous masterpiece! Best toon ever!","I just loved everything about Shrek! He is the most adorable green monster thats ever hit the screen. Both my wife and myself enjoyed it greatly, although we are both grown-ups. And all the kids that we know of loved him too... Shrek, please come back!"
846,Shrek,,16 May 2002,Greatest Animation Film... EVER!!!,"This film is excellent. The casting was brilliant and the jokes appeal to pretty much any and everybody. What stood out for me though, was the perfomance of a certain 'Donkey' (Eddie Murphy). I feel he should have got an oscar. Acting isn't just about drama, comedic timing is hard as well. Eddie Murphy had me tears... I haven't laughed as much since Mr Vampire... If you don't agree with me, ask yourself this... 'If Eddie Murphy was not in the film, would it have been as funny??' Remember, he improvised a lot of the lines!!! Long Live Donkey!!!"
847,Shrek,10,22 May 2001,"Outstanding CGI, and funny as .....","I am an avid movie buff and a computer geek as well.  Having two young daughters we love to go to the movies.  This movie has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in this genre.  Toy Story I & II were pretty good at entertaining the kids with a tongue in cheek for the parents, but Shrek has just blown that away.  I would recommend this to anyone even considering seeing it.  Be warned that since it is PG, it does have a few curse words, and depending on how strict you are they refer to Donkey as Ass a few times.Go see it, even if you don't have kids or don't like computer animated movies, I bet you'll enjoy this one."
848,Shrek,,21 May 2001,Shrek - Great for All Ages,"I took a 9 year old boy and a 13 year old girl to see this. Everyone loved it, on different levels. The boy loved all the farting and burping (typical for a 9 year old boy!), the girl loved the fact that Princess Fiona was such a kick-ass (the 'Charlies Angels' sequence was hysterical!), and I liked all the good- (or maybe not so good-) natured Disney bashing. Very well animated, more 'realistic' than Toy Story, with super voice talents. The four principals were exceptional, but the secondary characters - the gingerbread man, Pinnochio, the three pigs, the knights doing The Dating Game, and the wolf from Red Riding Hood - were really funny too, with some great lines. The music was super, the songs really blended with the action. I went right out and bought the soundtrack. All in all, a nice way for the whole family to spend an hour and a half.  Hey, when's the sequel coming out?"
849,Shrek,8,21 May 2001,Bathroom humor not as bad as I thought it would be,"I had heard a lot of hype about how crude the movie was (a lot of potty humor) and I don't like that type of humor very much and almost didn't see the movie.  I was very pleasantly surprised that there was not nearly as much as I thought there would be and I LOVED the movie.  I found the fart and burping jokes not as offensive as I thought I would, they were actually very funny.  I could have done without the ""ass"" jokes referring to the donkey, but that's just me. There is no way to describe how far computer animation has come.  You just have to go and see it to understand how soft and furry the donkey looks and how you know that the hair on the people is SO real looking.  It was UNREAL (in a very real sort of way!)."
850,Shrek,9,21 May 2001,Just enough satire to make a parent glad he took the kids!,"Shrek is the Princess Bride turned sideways and on it's head.  It takes the old line of beauty being only skin deep one more step, and makes even a six-year-old think about what is really important.  The tale is imaginative and satirical.  It has just enough comedy over the heads of the youngest audience members for the parents to enjoy the inside joke without having to squirm or explain it to the children."
851,Shrek,,21 May 2001,What a great movie! :),"Shrek was a really great movie! When I was in high school, I took an English class, and we read Beauty and the Beast. The teacher said, If the moral of the story were really correct, that outside looks do not matter, then the Beast would not have turned into a handsome prince, he would have stayed a beast, and the woman would have loved him anyway.Shrek is like Beauty and the Beast with a surprising twist. I loved all of the characters. The jokes were witty, and I would love to see this movie again!"
852,Shrek,10,21 May 2001,Loads of fun!,This film was sooo much fun.  I laughed my ars off.  :)  Great acting and great humor.  You could tell the actors were having lots of fun with this one and the makers weren't trying to make it into something it wasn't. Mainly for older teens and adults this film a little bit for everyone at least ten or older but fits better with fifteen or older.  There are some cute characters for younger kids but the humor is definitely over their heads.  Go see this film and enjoy.  :)
853,Shrek,,21 May 2001,Don't have kids?  Don't bother,"I really expected greatness from Shrek, so perhaps I'm not the best person to give a review.  On the other hand, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's read the overwhelmingly glowing reviews from the media.  So for those of you who expect Shrek to be an unparalleled triumph, be forewarned: it's not. It's just a good movie to take your kids to.The animation is undeniably sophisticated and sharp, but you can't last 90 minutes on technique.  There needs to be a good story.  The story of Shrek does expand on William Steig's 32-page children's story, but not enough to warrant the length.  Take away the pokes at fairy-tale conventions and pot-shots at Disney, take away the (often very funny) wisecracking Eddie Murphy as the Donkey, and it boils down to a 15 minute hero-rescues-the-princess plot.Having said that, I wasn't really ever bored watching it.  I just thought with all the time and effort they spent on the visuals, they could have taken more care to make it a more interesting story.  It doesn't hold an ear-wax candle to Toy Story 2 and Chicken Run."
854,Shrek,6,21 May 2001,Enjoyable but not Great,"Let me say first that I am clearly out of touch with most reviewers. I found the recent Bullwinkle movie great fun, yet the reviews here identify it as being among the worst movies ever.That said, Shrek is an enjoyable diversion. It has lots of fun gags that will get you to chuckle, especially if you get the Disney references. Unfortunately, it lacks a significant story. It's more of a series of gags held together by a thin string. It's worth your time to see it, but I just don't see the fun holding up for multiple viewings."
855,Shrek,10,9 May 2002,Comic brilliance!,"I just watched this movie again for the eleventh time, and realized that I had never written a comment on it, so here I go:SHREK is an absolute delight. When I saw it in theaters, I was expecting something stupid and another Disney movie. But, that it is not. SHREK aims much higher, trying to please audiences of all ages, instead of just going for the six and under crowd like Disney. I was pleased to see some adult humor in this film, especially since that is mainly what I relate to. I hate stupid corny and lame jokes seen in stupid Disney movies that I don't even want to bother commenting on. But, SHREK made me jump up from my seat and come online just to write this. I really enjoyed this. But, my complaint is that they are making a sequel. SHREK is a great movie. A milestone in filmmaking, and they are going to ruin it by trying to bombard in with a sequel that will kill the reputation that first film had. And the worst thing is, that all these people are going to see it because of how much they liked the first, and are going to sadly upset. I'm sure I will be one of those people. So, I just thought to write my comment and let everyone know how good this film is, before it gets destroyed by the upcoming SHREK 2."
856,Shrek,8,5 May 2002,"Jon Monsarrat review:  Kids movie & for adults, too. Formulaic but hilarious.","""Shrek"" definitely stretches the recent genre of fully 3D animated films. Although there's plenty of the syrupy, Disney-style attitude that fills kids movies to sickening heights, there is also a lot of adult-accessible attitude and wit.The film the series of little skits are just as funny or more so than those in ""The Princess Bride"". Basically it is a parody on fairy tales, and quite original on that level.However, the skits aren't stitched together very well into an overall plot. We see the timeless (and overused) powerful, tall straight man (Shrek, by Mike Myers) and funny, short, annoyingly talkative but somehow charming little man (Donkey, by Eddie Murphy) that we've seen in: Ice Age, Monsters Inc., all the way back to Abbott & Costello. Personally I found the characterization choppy -- the characters don't always do things that make sense for their character, especially the donkey, whom I simply found annoying.Despite all that, Shrek is definitely worth seeing if you're even remotely interested in fantasy or kids movies.Who should see this film:-- kids (and take your parents)-- adults who dare the occasional kids' flick (this one's safe)-- fantasy / sci-fi people of all typesI'll give Shrek an 8 out of 10, which is pretty good within the genre of non-risk-taking formulaic feel-good kids' animated films."
857,Shrek,10,26 April 2002,Endless laughs,"My son is 18 months old, he watches Shrek everyday, sometimes twice. I have to watch or listen to it with him and after 2 months of watching it i still have a laugh and don't mind watching it.  I have never had this experience with any other movie, it doesn't get annoying, i think thats why i like it so much, its funny even after you have watched it 50 times."
858,Shrek,,25 April 2002,"cute, funny little movie","Clever, funny animated feature almost resembles one big, giant in-joke. Shrek is a fearsome, flagrantly antisocial ogre who lives in a swamp peacefully as long as no one bothers him. Unfortunately his swamp is overrun by loony tunes who've been banished by the evil, self-absorbed Lord Farquaad. In order to restore peace to his swamp, Shrek makes a deal to go on an arduous journey to rescue a princess, but his trek is aided/hampered by the presence of a motor-mouthed donkey. Lots to grab your attention in this enjoyable animated feature, including terrific visuals, clever spoofs and parodies, and great voice work by the four leads. Good fun for all ages. ***"
859,Shrek,10,16 April 2002,Unbelievably good,I did not know what to expect. But this movie is really unbelievable. It works on multiple levels. Great for all ages. And it has tons of very good jokes. One things to note here: I have also seen the Czech version of the movie and I must say that they did a wonderful job in transferring (localizing) many cultural--fairy-tale--references and songs. Very good job indeed.
860,Shrek,10,16 April 2002,My favorite animated film to date,"(+) Very clever, very funny and very technically impressive. Kept me laughing from beginning to end, the ending scene and Swamp Karaoke Party had me dancing upright on the sofa! A must see, even if you don't like animated features.(-) Greek voice-over is very childish and much of the movie's comical wit is lost. Watch it in English or you'll miss more than half the fun."
861,Shrek,,15 April 2002,Mike Myers makes the magic happen!,"I really fail to understand many of the rather negative comments I've read here about this movie. For gosh sakes, its just an animated kid's movie, what were some of you expecting? ""Gone with the Wind?"" I personally would probably never have bothered to see it if my son wasn't an 8 year old. I really wasn't expecting much more than Toy Story or Monsters Inc. I was truly surprised.That said, I must also confess that I found Camron Diez to be disappointingly weak as the princess. Eddie Murphy was way overdone and overboard as the donkey. I mean there wasn't one second that I was able to forget that the ever-chattering voice behind the character was just Eddie Murphy going on and on and on in his usual Eddie Murphy style. And one of my all time favorite actors, John Lithgow, was unfortunately, simply an anaemic parody of himself as the King.However, this movie was saved as a great movie, animated or otherwise by a surprisingly stellar performance by none other than Mike Myers. It is still difficult for me to grasp that this very same idiotic SNL Pilsbury Dope-Boy who nauseated us all in such sick crap as ""Wayne's World"" and ""Austin Powers"" was the inspired genius behind that sardonic but yet wonderful character ""Shrek.""No matter how many times you watch the movie, (and I have both the video and an 8 year old, so I've seen it plenty!) you will never hear or find Mike Myers in this film, only the persona of ""Shrek."" Like Jim Carrey in ""The Truman Show,"" this is where Mike Myers proves to us all that he really belongs where he is in the industry. This movie is an easy ""10"", simply because Mike Myers or should I say ""Shrek,"" makes it one.One of the all time truly great characters in animation history!"
862,Shrek,10,16 April 2002,The Biggest Hit of 2001!,"To me, this film was very unusual and at the same time, very entertaining. From the opening titles to the end credits of the movie, I honestly could not stop laughing.Deep, Deep, in the forest, an ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) lives in a cabin with no one to talk to. He is basically lonely. But, all of that changes when a loud-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) shows up out of the blue, Shrek becomes annoyed that there is no peace and quiet around the forest like it use to be. It gets even louder when fairy tale characters show up and command Shrek and the donkey to go on a mission to save the beloved Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from an evil castle and return her to an evil king (John Lithgow). Along the way, Shrek and the donkey just get on eachothers nerves.I give 100% graditude towards Eddie Murphy who made me laugh harder than ever as he played the donkey.Mike Myers (Austin powers, Waynes World), Eddie Murphy (The Nutty Professor, Showtime,) Cameron Diaz (Vannila Sky, The Sweetest Thing), John Lithgow (Cliffhanger, Third Rock From the Sun) star in this unforgettable comedy that was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001!
                              Coming Soon:                                  Shrek 2"
863,Shrek,9,8 April 2002,Perfect mixture for all ages!,"It took me a good while before I sat down to watch Shrek. My friends said that it was good, and I like cartoons/animated movies. But most of these are for younger folk, by witch I mean audiences under 12-13. This movie however took me by storm! Never could I have thought it would be this good!The voice acting is great, the dialog out standing and the animations are pretty impressive. Branding this movie a children's-movie is  totally wrong! I don't want to underestimate the perception of the youngsters, but roughly I think half of the jokes are out of younger kids league. Sure it's a cute movie, but the comedy value is far beyond most children's movies. Which I think is great! To make a classic it has to be enjoyable by all ages. And I definitely think Shrek is up for that. There are too many movies ridiculing the perception of kids and serve them `jokes' on a plate. Jokes so bluntly obvious, and most often lacking anything that stimulates any brain activity that you can't really force yourself to even smile at them. So I'm not at all saying this movie is too `hard' for smaller kids to understand. It's a perfect mixture!Let's just see if the people behind this wonderful piece can make it even better, as I hear there's a Shrek 2 in the making. Hope it wont be just another `re-run' of this great movie or a bad sequel to make some extra cash."
864,Shrek,10,8 April 2002,This film has everything!!!,"I love this film, because it does have everything! A wonderful storyline, with a meaning, great characters (especially Donkey), an excellent soundtrack and some absolutely classic lines ""I'm a flying talking donkey"" and above all, it makes me laugh hysterically every time i see it (and i think i've seen it way too many many times)"
865,Shrek,9,6 April 2002,Tremendous!,"Shrek was a marvelous delight for anybody to have the privilege to see it. The movie was ideal in length and was a perfect spoof on several fairytales. From the creators of Antz, this movie brought smooth, computer-rendered animation onto the big screen, and definitely deserved the Academy Award it won.With an all-star cast of voicists (Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz), this movie easily shows the years of work they put into it. I loved this movie as a film and as a DVD, and I recommend it strongly, if anybody had not seen it already. It is clear and original, although taking much of a plot from other fairytales. I would look for an upcoming Shrek 2 to be nothing less than dazzling."
866,Shrek,7,4 April 2002,"Meh. It's good, I guess.","A lot of people might respond to this with, ""How can you possibly Meh this film??"" But I do, gladly. Meh. This movie just didn't tug at my heartstrings the way I wanted it to. Donkey is very cute but Shrek is a little too vulgar to be likeable.  (I have the disadvantage of being a real adult, so farting isn't funny to me.)  There are some humorous moments and the story is fine, but you can see the ending coming a mile off.  It sends a good message and is quirky and original, but it isn't this excellent, wonderful movie everyone thinks it is.  It's a good movie with some good parts -and some parts that are just annoying if you're more than  8 years old - but overall it has the feeling that it's trying too hard to be cool and hip.  (The ending scene with the Smashmouth concert is over-the-top blah and will look dated in no time.. and it isn't THAT good a song to begin with..)    It IS better than this year's other CG offering, Monsters Inc, (which is just an unfunny borefest.) but Shrek is no Toy Story and doesn't deserve all the attention it's been getting.   Way overrated.  My score: 7.5"
867,Shrek,,20 May 2001,FANTASTIC!!!!,"Went to see it on Friday and I thought I would bust a gut laughing. This is really a great fairy tale for adults. Little kids may not really get all the jokes and lines in it but the kids in the theater who were around 8 or over were laughing so hard, it was infectious. I actually went back to see it a second time which is unheard of and still laughed a great deal. Eddie Murphy is simply wonderful as a smart mouth donkey and the CGI gives excellent characteristics to match people with voices. The donkey looks like Eddie Murphy!!"
868,Shrek,10,25 March 2002,Realistic fairy tale,"I generally don't like new animated movies, but this was so adorable that I kept watching it over and over again.  I liked adaptation of old fairy tale to new modern ages.  Some one spend grate deal of time making this movie as realistic as possible (you can see Shrek sofa getting in its normal stage after Donkey jumped from it), it brought the fairy tale alive again, almost make you believe that there is justice on this world after all."
869,Shrek,7,25 March 2002,The Best Animated Feature in a year of slim animated pickings.(Contains a major spoiler),"If that sounds like a left-handed compliment, rest assured that it is.Shrek is not a terrible movie, it's not even all that bad, really. In fact, I just watched it again today.  The problem is that Shrek follows the exact same schmaltzy formula of the Disney features that it is purported to bunk. I don't know whether Princess Fiona was born an ogre or not, but it seems to me that in either case, it's a copy of The Little Mermaid.  The princess has to change to be like and please her true love.  What kind of lesson is that?My biggest complaint, though, is the near-complete failure on the part of the directors to choose decent music that will be enjoyable even two years from now.  I hated Smash Mouth's gimmicky ""All-Stars"" the first time I heard it, and I still hate it.  The rest of the songs are boring and unemotional, with the exception of the song with the line ""Broken Halleluiah.""  That is the only song, in my opinion, that can't be replaced because it plays an integral part in the emotions of the scene.  It is a very sad, sincere song, even if the movie around it doesn't always live up to that sincerity."
870,Shrek,8,22 March 2002,One of the funniest films ever.,"Shrek is a very, very entertaining film.  There have been many attempts to take the classic fairy-tale genre and stand it on its head, going back to ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" on the old ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoon (and probably further, but that's the first I saw), but none succeeds so magnificently as Shrek.  The film takes the classic theme of a princess trapped in a castle and guarded by a dragon, and a prince who sees her in a magic mirror and wants her for his wife--and adds an ugly, rude, yet oddly lovable ogre, sent /by/ said prince, as the hero.  Add huge groups of fairy tale characters and references to classic stories, Eddie Murphy as a wise-cracking donkey--I'm sure the directors just let him talk about whatever he wanted to and just found a way to work it in--gloriously brilliant comedic lines, outlandish situations (Shrek's little wrestling exhibition is great, and the Dewlock(sp?) song kills me every time) and the fact that the plot is actually quite good in and of itself, and you have an instant classic.  A few too many crude jokes bring the rating down a bit for me, but the movie is still absolutely brilliant."
871,Shrek,,18 March 2002,Into the Woods with Dream Works,"So if your swamp were invaded by hundreds of fairy tale refugees and a talking jackass, you'd probably turn into an ogre, right? If Moulin Rouge! can entertain us with time-shifted tunes and glitter, we shouldn't balk at a princess-matrix babe and reptilian balloon art. If you decide to see Shrek, prepare to be amused on one level and referentially challenged on another.
So Shrek's (Mike Myers) an ogre with a traditional lifestyle -ear wax candlelight dinners, cheap-joke flatulence, targeted by the villagers - until Lord Fahrquar (John Lithgow) decides to resettle all fairy tale characters. Shrek's swamp becomes a refugee camp for the mythologically obsolete and he's not amused. In turn, Fahrquar needs a queen and is auditioning prospects. Magic mirror brings the usual suspects to consider and Fahrquar chooses - surprise! - Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and the dragon. This collides with Shrek's mission to return his blissful swamp to the reptilians. But the real snake turns out to be Fahrquar and his soldiers provide WWF-grade entertainment to the ""Disney world"" of Walt's dreams. Shrek's real adventure begins here. Eddie Murphy is the metaphorical ass (a pain in, Sancho Panza, etc) who gets most of the good lines and the big babes. John Lithgow never stood taller, Mike Myers never looked so good and Cameron Diaz is a force to be reckoned with. And you should expect messages throughout including the superficiality of prejudging only by looks, the importance of friends and more. I haven't seen a cartoon so loaded with spoofs on the movie industry since Aladdin.  Eddie Murphy approaches Robin Williams's nuttiness without the manic delivery but you may need a scorecard to identify all of the players. Computer animation is going through another predictable life crisis with Shrek. Can we look more real while maintaining cartoon-cuteness characters or shall we dumb it down and keep the audience entertained. DreamWorks has given the techies good reason to stay current or completely lose their edge. Take a kid and enjoy yourself."
872,Shrek,9,18 March 2002,My reservations against computer animation are gone,"I have always had reservations against computer animation. It seemed too easy. What could only be made in months by classical techniques can be done in seconds by new techniques. In other words, computer animation is the end of animation, I thought. It would only improve the quantity but not the quality, I thought. Sadly Disney has shown us some examples of this. (Every Disney classic suddenly got a number II sequel of lower quality on video and DVD, to give an example). But in Shrek Dreamworks have taken animation up to a higher level and it really is amazing. They did not simply let the computer take over most of the work. They developed new techniques, not to save time, but to open new possibilities. Shrek took three years to make, the same period of time a classical animated movie took to make. The result is amazing. We see a new world, not just filled with cartoon characters, but with also with (almost real life) humans! As far as the movie itself goes, it is fantastic! The story is good, the jokes are good, the tempo is good. In other words, buy it and see it again and again! This is the new world of animated movie."
873,Shrek,10,12 March 2002,Brilliant!,"I had to get this movie on DVD just so I could go over and over the scenes that I kept missing.... from laughing too loud!My mother watched this on a late flight from Thailand to Australia. The stewards had to ask her to quiet down a little, she was waking the entire plane with her laughter.Brilliant movie."
874,Shrek,9,6 March 2002,Loved this movie,"The most endearing aspect of this movie is the ogre's face. It is huge, it is wierd, and his ears are like lotus-stalks, but nobody can deny the face is cute. I was able to sit with my daughter (not yet 3 years) and laugh at Shrek, and with Shrek, and she loved it. And even for slightly older children, the politically correct moment is both touching and very timely : an ogress believing a kiss from a true beloved would make her beautiful, and when it does not (and she wails, 'i am still ugly'), the guy very romantically corrects to say she IS beautiful. worth keeping at home for watching time and again."
875,Shrek,9,5 March 2002,Funny.,"I'm going to make this short.The title pretty much says it all this is a funny movie. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy have incredible charisma in this movie. The script is incredibly funny and the plot is highly amusing, this may seem like a kid's movie to those who have seen it, but it's for everyone (although I'm just a kid). The ongoing jokes and satire based on very big movies makes this a great movie. Myers, Murphy, Diaz, Lithgow, wonderful team."
876,Shrek,,2 March 2002,"delightful, funny satire of Disney and fairy tales","Please, people. You don't like the fart jokes? The key word is context. The fart jokes help establish the main character and the mood of ""Shrek"" - Shrek is a crude ogre and the movie is not your average fairy tale. I don't know why anyone would criticize the animation - it's really fabulous. And the plot itself is very well-written; it does a good job of satirizing Disney and just fairy tales in general, and all the characters are very non-cliche. This movie is very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it."
877,Shrek,7,27 February 2002,Funny anti-Disney...,"1st watched 2/27/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson): Funny anti-Disney, anti-cute fairy tale, computer animated, ugly ogre wins all story.  This starts out from the beginning as a big slap in the face to the usual Disney princess gets rescued by the handsome prince charming with many references to that other animation studio throughout.  And Dreamworks truly has gone another direction by adding some adult humor, cursing, and even sex references to it's recent movies like this and the well-made but overlooked Antz.  It's still ok for kids, but also bearable for adults and that's where I think they have really got something different in the way of animation.  There is also a lot of great music whether it's a remake or a new tune(for the most part not sung by the characters but a background to the story.)  All in all this movie is a pretty fun way to spend an hour and a half with a pretty basic story but humorous and entertaining throughout."
878,Shrek,10,23 February 2002,"Great, great movie!","Hilarious! I just couldn´t stop laughing during the whole film. The donkey was great!! He was the real star of the movie. The moral lesson of this film was very good. The plot was certainly predictable, but good. The parodies were fantastic. The character development was great. I didn´t expect this movie to be so good! I just hope its sequel is as good as this one, or even better (although making a movie better than this one is difficult)."
879,Shrek,8,21 February 2002,Make sure you see this,"If you want to put a smile on your face and that of your kids, see this movie. A well told story, excellent humour and a must for your library as you will see things you've missed in earlier viewings. Have fun!"
880,Shrek,8,20 February 2002,Fun for Everyone,"Shrek is a very enjoyable film for everyone from children to adults.  Much of the humor is aimed at the mature audience, yet it maintains its ""fairy tale"" feel.  Shrek blends humor and adventure in a fast paced tale that exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend this film for all ages!"
881,Shrek,10,18 February 2002,"Great movie!  Get this one on DVD, it's a keeper.","This movie is great adult entrainment that kids would like as well.  Some of it is a little PG (rating) but I think that most kids would be mostly amused by the visual graphics and miss the adult under current in the PG parts.I am not nuts about the adult cartoons but this was excellent!  It is one of the best movies I've seen recently.  Pay attention to all the spoofs of almost everything.  Other movies, music, cartoons, pop culture, political correctness (dragon unwanted touching), nothing is off limits.  You really have to watch it a second time to pick up on the many little things that are easy to miss the first time through.Great movie.  Get this one on DVD, it's a keeper.  10/10"
882,Shrek,,20 May 2001,not too bad,"Whilst everyone has been dissing on Shrek for it being too trite and more as a vehicle to poke at Disney, I don't think it was all that bad. I didn't like the beginning credits with the gross humor, but they certainly got laughs with the little kids. The more adultlike/teenage humor went straight over the young kids' heads, also. Some people complain that this was not a thought-provoking movie, but if you wanted to see a thought-provoking movie, why'd you go see this one?I loved the pop culture references. They may seem stupid in a few years, but I never get sick of those types of movies. The infamous ""EAT ME!"" statement by the gingerbread man was said in the exact same way as the Slim Jim commercials I see quite often. I loved the poke at Disney World with animatronic dolls singing about Farquaad's ""king""dom. I despise the Small World ride at Disney and I am glad they poked at it. It may have been cruel to poke at Snow White and Cinderella, but gee golly willakers, don't you think it's about time?"
883,Shrek,,16 February 2002,"Realistic 3-d animation becomes fun, hip, even sexy","Animation is for kids, right? Wrong. We're seeing the evolution of a new medium that can give voice to more diverse thoughts than either hand animation or film. This film makes you wonder what is to come in terms of super-real computer animation. Self-aware and knowing humor combined with eye-popping exploitation of the new computer capabilities makes this a delight on multiple levels. Presumably we are on the verge of an explosion of creativity since anything that can be imagined can be represented.
Delicious voice performances particularly by John Lithgow as the would-be King, and Cameron Diaz as the Princess. Eddie Murphy as the Donkey is ... shall we say not disappointing."
884,Shrek,,13 February 2002,Not one for the ages,"I can't stand this movie. It's not as clever as it wants to think it is. I couldn't stand the music or the fart jokes. The emperor has no clothes,folks,and in SHREK's case,he's swinging his weiner at the audience."
885,Shrek,9,4 February 2002,one of the sweetest and funniest movies I've ever seen!,"I haven't laughed as loud and hard in a long,long time,as I did when I watched Shrek. I found everything about it irresistible and charming,and the effects were great...absolutely the best animated film I've ever seen! The only thing that I didn't like was the ending,but thats all i'm gonna say about that. I would recommend Shrek to everybody,and just maybe after the movie you have found that inner child in you,the one that has been lost for a long time. Then you might be able to enjoy the little things in life again..."
886,Shrek,9,31 January 2002,Rage does wonders for satire,"For adults familiar with Hollywood, this film is a delight. Katzenberg's venom is evident and really funny. This is biting satire and parody that is just about as good as it can get. Of course, those totally unfamiliar with this background will also love this delightfully twisted fairy tale. And while the obligatory happy fairly tale ending is achieved, well, let's just say it too is bigger and better than one would expect. This is one to enjoy over and over."
887,Shrek,10,5 January 2002,Great Movie,Finally a true family movie. This movie was better the second time I saw it. Eddie Murphy did a great job. Everyone who saw it has great things to say about it. I would recommend buying this one as it's worth watching a few times. Enjoy.
888,Shrek,9,20 May 2001,The sheer amount of in-jokes is amazing...,"In all honesty, I think this is the best movie I've seen so far this year. It had a very sweet and touching tale with a GREAT ending and a lot of funny twists and turns, but the one thing that made this movie great was Katzenberg making this an allegory that shows his pure hatred for Disney. Think about it:Shrek: Katzenberg Farquaad: Michael Eisner Donkey: David Geffen Princess Fiona: Steven SpielbergAnyways, overanalyzing aside, if you have watched Disney movies your entire life and have been to Disneyworld, go see this movie, there are so many jokes that poke fun at or rip apart these things that it really is worth seeing!"
889,Shrek,,2 January 2002,A rare thing: a parody with heart,"Ogres, we are told by the title character in ""Shrek,"" are like onions: they both have layers.  The same might be said for the movie itself, which delights on so many levels that it achieves that highest ambition of ""family"" movies--appealing to all ages at once.On its most basic level, ""Shrek"" is a flat-out comedy, taking shots at anything even remotely within range.  A good portion of the ammo is devoted to potshots at Jeffery Katzenberg's previous employer Disney: the villian, reportedly modeled after Michael Eisner, is a diminutive megalomaniac aptly named Lord Farquaad, and his kingdom of Duloc can best be described as the Magic Kingdom if it had been designed by George Orwell.  There is the standard dose of pop-culture and film references, balanced with a helping of meaner gross-out humor (the fact that Shrek makes candles from his own earwax is stomach-turning enough, but the question of what he uses for the wick doesn't bear examining).The jokes provide laughs enough, but the true secret to the film's humor is more subtle.  Much like ""The Princess Bride"" before it, ""Shrek"" is a cunning satire on the conventions in fairy-tales--and, by extention, the films inspired by them.  Much has been said of the ""formula"" employed by Disney and its imitators, and ""Shrek"" uses every opportunity to overturn the elements of the tried-and-occasionaly-true design.  Shrek, like many recent animated heros, is an outcast; unlike them, he doesn't pine for acceptance by society but has concluded he's much better off outside of it.  Indeed, his motivation for going on his quest is to rid his home of the fairytale creatures Farquaad has unceremoniously deported to the area.  The object of said quest, a comely red-haired princess named Fiona, has the spunk characteristic of the post-modern Disney heroines but balances it with the ""someday my prince will come"" mentality of earlier protagonists.  Her philosophy of the way things are ""supposed"" to be blinds her, signifying the danger of taking fairytale conventions too seriously.  Best of all is Shrek's sidekick, a locquacious jackass known only as Donkey.  Voiced by Eddie Murphy, Donkey is a stand-in for every anthropomorphized supporting player shoehorned into these films for the sake of comic relief.  Such characters often attempt to be cute but come off as obnoxious; here, Murphy acheives the opposite result as a deliberately obnoxious character who manages to become endearing.And here is the core of Shrek's appeal, for despite the caustic views toward fairy-tale archetypes the film (again in the manner of ""Princess Bride"") somehow manages to find the charm and spirit which makes those archetypes so appealing to begin with.  By making Shrek's and Fiona's obstacles internal instead of external, their characters become more fleshed out and their journey all the more touching.  And when the inevitible ""Beauty and the Beast"" romance arrives, it is presented with a twist that adds new resonance to the concept.  And in the end, the movie leaves us with the cheerful warmth that can only be provided by a happy ending--even an unconventional one."
890,Shrek,8,30 December 2001,"Take that, Disney!","Forget all that Brothers Grimm crap...this is the real deal! SHREK ROCKS. Zany characters, humor that kids and adults can both understand and charming in its own weird way! A backwards romp! Something clever and exciting that Disney stopped doing after the early nineties.... Remember when a new Disney movie was a big deal...and how it was actually entertaining? Well, this might take you back to those glory days."
891,Shrek,9,30 December 2001,100% fun plus a very good story!,"I've bought this one on DVD and IT WAS WORTH IT!!Lord Farquaad wants all fairytale creatures away from his land. He isolates them in the swamp where Shrek lives. Shrek doesn't like that so he and his new friend, the donkey, goes to Lord Farquaad. He says that to get back his land, he'll have to find a specific princess that lives in a castle, surrounded by lava and protected by a dragon...A good story mixed up with extremely good humour, nice computer-graphic and good characters, becomes Shrek!If you haven't seen it, I can only recommend you too, if you already have seen it, why not see it again?"
892,Shrek,7,3 January 2002,Wonderful,"7/10 because almost everything I've seen recently has been so poor  finally a movie (computer cartoon actually) that is overwhelmingly entertaining, visually spectacular, well written and directed.  This film (cartoon) is a must see for the entire family.The cartoon is blessed with the voices of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Mike Myers and an especially devious John Lithgow.  If they gave out Academy Awards for voice-overs, certainly Mr. Murphy and Mr. Myers would be in the running.  Perhaps the Academy should consider a special award for this little masterpiece.  Whatever.  The simple story of the outcast ogre and his hyperactive donkey out to rescue the trapped princess is wonderful.  The action and interactions never cease making this a super movie-going or movie rental experience.  The madness of Lord Farquat in trying to make a perfect paradise in which (the magic mirror tells him) only he can do if he marries a princess.  The social comparisons are obvious but never overbearing.  The quest of the ogre and the donkey is captivating. The rescue of the princess is an intense as can be and as surprising as well.  The sequence is excellent. I could go on and on.  Go see it for yourself and see what I mean."
893,Shrek,,4 September 2001,What a giggle.,"This movie made me laugh harder than anything for at least the last six months. If you haven't seen it yet, be you adult or child, do your very best to find a cinema still showing it. Trust me, it's worth it.In a summer of let-downs and bad sequels, it was refreshing to come across a movie as original as Shrek. Completely accessible to both adults and children, Shrek seems to poke fun at anything the writers could think of. The Matrix, Scotsmen and every fairy tale ever written are all in the firing line, and it's all done so very well.Eddie Murphy is undoubtedly the star of the show with scene-stealing lines that just get better and better. Myers revels in his role as a mad Scottish ogre, and far surpasses his Scotsmen in Austin Powers 2 and So I Married an Axe Murderer. Diaz appears to play it straight, but you get the feeling that she was smiling all the way through.In summary, a fantastic film that should be seen by everyone as soon as possible."
894,Shrek,10,15 July 2001,Best movie I've seen this year!,"At firt I was uncertain whether an animated movie was a good choice for adaults. Boy was I tought a lesson!Shrek is one of the best movies I've seen this year. If you want to go to the Theater and just be entertained for a little while without any strings attached, this is the movie to see!This movie sets new standards for animated movies. Not just for the quality of the animations, but also for humorous content. No matter what age you are, the Shrek will entertain you."
895,Shrek,9,14 July 2001,Very comical!,"""Shrek"" is a very funny movie.   I give a lot of credit to Mike Myers, who made sure it was funny, by doing the voice all over again in the right ogre voice.  Everytime you hear the word ""donkey"" from Shrek's mouth just makes you giggle.  The performing voice of John Lithgow has a very funny tone considering his Emmy-winning performance on ""3rd Rock of the Sun"".  Someone we now used to play the coach on that show.  Eddy Murphy is a great fit for the donkey.  It was overall very funny."
896,Shrek,,13 July 2001,Absolutely Hilarious,"Fairy tales are meant for kids, write? Well, i can guarantee that this one isn't. You go expecting Prince Charming to save the princess from the big ugly ogre. Well, swap the prince (no longer charming) and the ogre, and you pretty much end up with Shrek. Myres did a good job on this one, though there isn't really much of a difference between him and Shrek. Murphy's Donkey is an absolutley hilarious companion/sidekick. I like that donkey, it's a NICE donkey!  (those that have seen Shrek will get that, but the rest of you won't). Lithgoe's voice was perfect for Lord Farqoud, though that isn't really much of a name, is it? Diaz did good. You don't expect princesses to beat people up, or turn into ogres at night, but what the hey?! The ending wasn't brilliant, and donkey's don't date dragons about 50 times the size them, but we'll make an exception for Donkey. I'd say it was a good family movie, but it wouldn't have been much without the one liners and the twists. I saw it with a few friends, and we had a good time."
897,Shrek,7,13 July 2001,No bugs.,"Shrek is a solid crowd-pleaser. There is something for everyone, and is definitely worth seeing. However, this movie reinforces my belief that a movie that pleases everyone can never be really ""Great"" (with the capital G). Caveat: Through a kid's eyes, this is probably a 10, and I wouldn't argue. For me, though, I have to stick with a 7--Shrek just doesn't have the dramatic or emotional depth to really stick, and I don't do the Ebert thing, where one genre enjoys a different rating system from another.
Basically, Shrek is the newest ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"", or ""Toy Story"". These movies all share the same kind of substance--really light overall fare for the kids, some ironic or risque humor for the adults, cutting edge computer animation, and the usual formulaic plot. There is no real complexity, no daring dialogue or content, no philosophical dilemmas. And of course, there shouldn't be--it is primarily a show for kids, which is the movie's strength and its weakness.What earns the 7 for me, as with all of the aforementioned computer graphic vehicles, is the animation, which takes the safe, mundane content to an enjoyable level. It is really stunning to witness the visuals that can now be rendered for the movies. We must be only a few years away from doing away with human actors altogether--today, you can still easily see the clumsy human movements, but it's getting harder and harder with each new film.Maybe that's why Shrek, while unquestionably entertaining, still leaves me with a bit of an empty feeling. It's too close to real, without the reality. It would be like watching Cameron Diaz act through a movie wearing a Cameron Diaz mask. But I digress. Shrek entertains. It is witty. It is cute. It is pleasant. It has no bugs."
898,Shrek,7,10 July 2001,Finally a film this Summer that ALMOST lives up to the hype...,"With it's rapturous reception at Cannes and box-office success both sides of the Atlantic, what I'm about to say may come as a bit of a shock.....sitting comfortably?.....pulse ok?.....Shrek is not quite as good as you think.Recovered? Good, because Shrek is still a damn good film. It looks great, is funny, and the characters are endearing. Myers' Ogre may be a little dull sometimes, but Diaz' fiesty princess and the Donkey (an absolute scream, and possibly Murphy's best role in years) more than make up for that. Most of all, it's brimming with an attitude and streetwise nature which many of Disney's films lack, which recognises that kids really can be nasty little sods at times, and are far from stupid. 'Shrek' really does pull the conventions of the fairy tale to pieces at times, and it's combination of body jokes and black humour (the Magic Mirror's 'Blind Date' style description of Snow White (""Though she lives with 7 guys, she's not easy"") for example) are an unceasing attack on Walt's whole back catalogue of kiddies classics.However, it does have it's faults. The script is a little light in the joke department. When it's funny it's really funny, but there's not enough humour for all ages to strike a perfect balance and you feel that, without Murphy's wisecracking ass, Shrek could have been pretty boring (the rumours were that Dreamworks cut much of the black humour out of the film to get its certificate, so this may explain it). The main premise of the film isn't used enough either. Aside from the start and end sequences of the film (with the exception of one hilarious fight with Robin Hood and his Merry Men), the fairy tale cast is anonymous - a shame, as it's a great idea.Despite that, Shrek is still a great piece of entertainment and shows that Dreamworks, although they lack the quality script of a 'Toy Story', aren't too far off of stealing Disney's crown.8/10"
899,Shrek,10,10 July 2001,Brilliant!,"i have to admit, this is the funniest and best animated feature i have ever seen.  I did notice that the humour was NOT 'cheesy', which is a very very very good thing.  It was very simple humour, which at some times were quite adult, but that's the way we like it!It visually looks stunning.  The scenery, the characters and also the voices are perfect.  I would recommend it to anybody who has eyes, ears and a heart."
900,Shrek,10,14 July 2001,Amazing!,Great work it is! I can`t image that even cartoon can make it so cool.dialog`s fun.texture and motion capture are real.and voice cast is invincible! but it`s a little too short. Is that happiness always gone fast?
901,Shrek,10,13 July 2001,I'm glad I didnt read these comments first.....,"What a bunch of misery mongers some people are. Arent we allowed to go to a movie now and JUST ENJOY it??This film was pure, unadulterated escapism. Sure it was vulgar in parts, in was also extremely clever, visually stunning,(toned down cos it looked too real at first) and one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time. I belly laughed!!!!  If I compared this movie to anything it would be ""The Princess Bride"". One of my all time favourite movies that covered all the bases in entertaining every member of the family. If you havent seen the movie yet dont take notice of ANY of the comments here, since just as many people are ready to trash it as praise it. Just sit back relax and watch with an open mind and I for one sincerely hope you have 90 minutes of pure joy as I did."
902,Shrek,9,13 July 2001,You'll laugh until your stomach hurts!,"After seeing the trailer and checking the cast list I went to see this film with some idea of what to expect. What I hadn't reckoned on was just how hilarious this send-up of fairy tales was going to be! It pulls no punches in its 'attack' on established animated tales.Myers puts on his Scottish accent for the lead - Shrek - which works surprisingly well. Murphy performs at his usual high level for the voice of the donkey, at least as good as Robin Williams was as the genie in ""Disney's Aladdin"". Lithgow is superb as the evil king and Diaz has some great lines too.The animation is excellent, with close attention to detail only seen on Japanese offerings, such as ""My Neighbor Totoro"". What makes this film, though, is the humour. There is one scene (and I won't spoil it by saying which one) that just made me crack up and laugh until I was crying. I had to work hard to control myself, or I would have missed the rest of the show!Altogether a brilliant animation with a big comic element, and the best since ""The Emperor's New Groove"". Great for all ages, but will be enjoyed more by those who are familiar with traditional fairy tales."
903,Shrek,9,11 July 2001,Revolutionary,"After years of monopoly over animation, Dreamworks appeared to finally cease with the repeated formula used for most children's movies. Shrek is completely unexpected, twisting everything you're used to seeing on a movie. The most important of them all: it is sincere. Besides the amazing acting from all the cast, there is authenticity on the actions of the characters. Against ""Beauty and the Beast"", this movie truly shows what true love is expected to be. There is no need for the ugly character to become beautiful. That's important. It truly breaks the mad vanity in which the world is sunk. It's not like ""The Hunchback of NotreDame"", in which there is NO WAY the girl can fall in love with Quasimodos. It shows depth. Besides that, it portraits the characters doing ""human"" things, like joking and laughing at each other, and burping or cursing. Some people seem to be offended by that. I find it great. Why keeping this kind of behaviour hidden? It's in all of us, anyway. Kids must learn to find it natural, not to create some myth around it. The main character, Shrek, who is rude, ugly and selfish, still has a lot of charisma. And we feel it because he is truthful. Irony, action, romance, lots of fun and a fast-paced story makes this movie extremely enjoyable. It was about time someone would revolutionize fairy tales."
904,Shrek,9,10 July 2001,Modern reality in parable at last!!!,"Take your children to see this film! We have waited a very, very, long time to see such a simple reality. To see reality portrayed as a children's parable voiced by the myth that is Cameron Diaz is irony beyond any standard I would have thought possible of American cinema! At last commercial cinema has found a back bone compatible with a sense of humour! By modern standards there may be little action, but the humour is spine-chillingly precise!This is not a flashy, violent, traditional, standard film, in fact it parodies the traditional narrative, but it does it with a class & style unparelled in children's story telling. Adults will be able to guess the conclusion, but children will not, yet both will leave the cinema satisfied & at peace! This film evokes a very, very rare ageless equalibrium. A film for the whole family where everyone is truely satisfied. It is the 1st real children's fable since the brothers Grimm or Hans Anderson, it is the 1st story since then to really make a statement to children in their own language, yet mentally stimulating enough to make adults marvel at it's wisdom & wish they had been told this tale at bedtime. This story is a gem."
905,Shrek,,9 July 2001,Very enjoyable,"I haven't laughed at a film as much as this in a long time. This is popcorn cinema at its best. Eddie Murphy's donkey is excellent as are all the characters. Ok, afterwards it dissolves in the brain like sherbet and it certainly is not a top #250 film. However I really liked it and it's a probable 8."
906,Shrek,6,9 July 2001,Summer is getting better...,"So, I watch Pearl Harbor, and almost lose my faith in Hollywood.Then, Shrek comes by. Yes!!!What can I say. It's a very enjoyable movie experience, aided by the vocal talents of Myers, Murphy and Diaz. I couldn't stop laughing when Murphy (or the donkey) was on screen. Myers wasn't that funny, but he had an ogre to portrait, so it was to be expected. Cameron Diaz was hilarious. Heck, everyone was hilarious.Spoiler ahead:You might wet your pants when the parody of ""It's a small world"" comes out!This movie is a definite 9, 4.5 stars out of 10, maybe the best Dreamworks production to date. And I don't expect the Jurassic Dinos to come even close. It's a must-not-miss!"
907,Shrek,,19 May 2001,"Yuck. Avoid this one, it's a waste of time.","I went to see this one out of curiosity. After the wonderful ""Prince of Egypt"" and the reasonably entertaining ""Ants"", I was hoping that this one would at least be serviceable for popcorn fun on a rainy Saturday afternoon. But it wasn't.Somehow, this movie seems to be designed for drab rainy Saturdays. ""Shrek"" is one of the most depressing and joyless films I have had the displeasure to watch in a long long time. It wants to be a carefree and rollicking frolic, but it's far too mean-spirited and sarcastic for that. It's dark and a reminder of how much innocence has been lost in the storm of Hollywood's current commercialized thinking, and its main driving emotions seem to be pain and anger.Now I must admit that I haven't seen many movies this year. But that's deliberate: I've avoided most of the stinkers of 2001 like ""Monkeybone"" and ""Freddy Got Fingered"". So I'm not saying it's worse than those since I honestly can't say. But I *can* say that I didn't like it at all.Do I really have to repeat the plot? Everyone probably knows it by now thanks to all the hype, so I'll just say its the basic hero-on-a-quest-with-a-sarcastic-twist formula.The animation, it is true, is glorious. It's so beautifully designed and ups the medium of computer animation so high that it puts Toy Story and Toy Story 2 to shame. But just as it is with movies that rely entirely on special effects, gorgeous looks can't save a terrible script.First of all, why is this rated PG and not PG-13? It almost made me vomit during just the opening credits alone. Don't take the kids to this thinking that it's innocent family entertainment. It isn't.The much-ballyhooed fairy tale twist is merely a brief sidebar and mentioned for only about ten minutes or so of screen time. And the ""funny"" spoofs of fairy tales aren't funny. They're cruel. That's the only appropriate term I can come up with for this stuff.Cruel? Well, let me put me put it this way: how else do you describe a scene that shows the three bears in cages with the baby bear in a smaller separate cage crying to his parents about how his cage is too small? And how we later see that Mama Bear has been killed and turned into a rug in the evil Lord's home? THIS is funny??? Or how about the torturing of The Gingerbread Man? Ho ho ho, someone calm me down, it's so hilarious I forgot to laugh.An even worse problem: Shrek and his donkey sidekick are not likeable in this film. Eddie Murphy does a great job in his performance, but unlike ""Mulan"" he is allowed to babble on and on to the point where we find him just as annoying as Shrek does. Even worse, Shrek himself isn't likeable. He's obnoxious, selfish and self-protective. Of course this begins to change mid-film, but by then we barely care. And Myer's vocals here are dumb and uninteresting.Oh yeah, and they use him as an excuse to pile on tones of needless toilet humour.Avoid this one at all costs. If you want a cool spoof of fairy tales, try something along the lines of ""Into The Woods"". This sorry piece of trash actually bored me to the point where thirty minutes into it I was anxious glancing at my watch and contemplating leaving early."
908,Shrek,,19 May 2001,Can't anybody write a story any more?,"SHREK could have been a nice, simple story about beauty being in the eye of the beholder. The DreamWorks people are so insistent on putting a finger in Disney's eye that they persistently undermine what little story there is in SHREK.Mike Myers is affecting as the ogre and gives a good performance. Eddie Murphy is allowed to run on at the mouth until you just wish for a pair of earplugs. Generally speaking the latter part of the film is better than the first part; but there is no pacing, the climactic revelation happens TWICE (can't anyone make a film any more?) and the filmmakers telegraph every major story point.  If they had slowed down a bit, it would have been a real pleasure to watch the visuals--a decided improvement over the first PDI-Dreamworks film, ANTZ. YOu care about Shrek, which is quite an achievement. Dear DreamWorks, get over this childish one-upmanship with Disney; drop the other shoe and make a real movie, not a collection of parodic shots that date before the film is finished (the CROUCHING TIGER references are going to look very, very dated in a manner of months, as do the RIVERDANCE shots.)  The fact is, this fairy tale parody is getting very, very tiresome and there is no need to consistently parody the genre when you are in fact telling the BEAUTY AND THE BEAST story in reverse."
909,Shrek,9,17 June 2001,I HAD A CHOICE: THIS OR PEARL HARBOR!,"...So I chose this movie instead! But only because it has been getting some excellent reviews (the thought of watching three hours or more of a T.V. soap opera romance persuaded me to change my mind).The plot line is a witty, modern-day twist on classic fairy tales. Although not original, the story was anything but boring, and it was fun, even for the adults! There were also no irritating musical scores at every opportunity (ala Disney). This tends to keep me away from animated movies.Mike Myers was excellent as Shrek, I recognized his Austin Power character's voice. Eddie Murphy was really good as the Donkey, and Cameron Diaz (although I'm not a fan of her movies) was OK as the Princess. The Donkey is my favorite character.  His expressions were soooo endearingly cute!It is interesting to note the (mostly) adult audience I sat with (it was a late evening session) were actually applausing during parts of this film!CONCLUSION? Check out the scene where the Gingerbread Man is being interrogated by the Prince. Priceless."
910,Shrek,10,17 June 2001,Most fun I've had in ages..,"I took my son (17) to see Shrek, knowing that it had gotten good reviews, but little else other than the basic premise.  I had not seen any of the previews or TV ads, either.  So I was not entirely certain what I would get.What I got was a witty, howlingly funny and touching interpretation of a classic fairy tale that was fresh, enjoyable at multiple levels - so many that I will have to go see it multiple times to catch all of it.The gross-outs of the first few minutes were, in my view, overdone, but once the writers got that out of their system, they settled down to tell a delightful story, peppered with numerous pop (and classic) culture references from the 60s and up that had parents laughing louder than the kids at times.  And the story took twists and turns that I had not expected, leading me to appreciate the film even more.I am not a big fan of Mike Meyers nor Eddie Murphy, but they did a wonderful job here.  Cameron Diaz' Princess Fiona was an unexpected treat, in more ways than one.I can understand that some people might get turned off by the first five minutes or so, but if you can make it through that, there's a good chance you'll leave the theatre grinning from ear to ear."
911,Shrek,10,17 June 2001,best laugh since something about mary,At first the comedy seemed extremely cliched but match that in with superb animation and you end up with the best movie from Hollywood in a long long time. I would recommend seeing this movie as I certainly will be going back for more.
912,Shrek,,17 June 2001,"Not BAD, but no Toy Story","I know I'm in the minority here, since it seems that everyone can't get enough of Shrek. I'm not american. I was brought up on the much grittier, blacker comedies of Britain and Australia. I therefore got off to a bad start when Shrek's opening moments consisted of nothing but flatulence humour. For god's sake, the Young Ones were doing that nearly 20 years ago and it's been subsequently picked clean by Matt and Trey with 'South Park'. I yawned. I think I am the ONLY person in the world to NOT think the Gingerbread Man is the funniest thing in the aforementioned world. What is the deal here?I feel that everyone is being mesmerized by the admittedly top-notch CGI animation and the comfortingly simple moral of the story. And I think that's part of Shrek's problem. The animation is TOO good. I kept being distracted from whatever character development might have been happening by every single hair painstakingly rendered on the donkey or on Fiona's head. The writers seem to be so busy taking rather luke-warm potshots at Disney's canon (I doubt Michael Eisner and Peter Schneider are smarting from the barbs) that the characters just don't grab you. Eddie Murphy's performance is the only decent thing about it...even if some of his script IS rather inexplicable (what's he babbling about PARFAITS for?...). I have yet to see why everyone adores Mike Myers so much. Maybe it's because I never saw Saturday Night Live or any Austin Powers movies. But the fact that Dreamworks splash Myers/Murphy/Diaz/Lithgow in bigger lettering than the title of the movie seems to say that they're lacking in some confidence as to the quality of the story and the characters...only big-name power can bring the crowds. And it seems, it's working. If an equally talented. yet unknown actor had voiced Shrek, would everyone still adore him so much? Cameron Diaz's Princess Fiona wasn't bad, but her motives as a character were a little confusing. If she's so keen to play the role of the princess-in-distress, where did she get the need to be able to Xena-whallop a gang of annoying Merry Men? If she's meant to be a parody of a fairytale princess, that's fine, but inserting the Lara Croft element for no real reason only undermines and weakens her role in the story. The climax was the biggest groaner. I guessed SO far in advance what was going to happen, the least they could do was bring it about in an original manner. The emotional climax of a movie, when we're supposed to empathize with characters the MOST, isn't the time to indulge the Anti-Disney Elf again.Look at Toy Story. Woody and Buzz are only 5 years old, but they're already part of the cultural lexicon. Say 'To Infinity and Beyond!' or 'There's a snake in mah boot!' to anyone and they'll crack a smile. I can't see any of the cast of Shrek being clamoured over on ebay. Not that memorable characters and movies have to hinge on catchphrases or merchandise, but the success of toy story was that Pixar made sure you ONLY concentrated on the characters, not off-the-cuff in-jokes put there by writers to remind you that you're supposed to only watch and mock, not get involved.Watertight, emotionally-gripping storytelling is the first and most important thing in ANY movie, even a comedy. An entertaining story can be told with less-than-perfect production values (like South Park), but all the money and technological marvels and big-name voices can't save a slip-shod story and characters with no real heart.Emperor's New Groove was an outstanding example of the modern animated satire (along with Chicken Run, tellingly a non-american production). They have the potential to do consistently great stuff (Prince of Egypt was a very good start) if only they realise that great comedy and drama comes from character, not bells and whistles."
913,Shrek,9,15 June 2001,Very funny and entertaining,This is the best movie that I've seen in a long while. I kept laughing and laughing. And I don't remember ever laughing so hard before. It's an excellent show and I'll definitely recommend this show to others.
914,Shrek,9,17 June 2001,A comedy's comedy,"What a remarkable piece of work is Shrek! Stunning fairy tale fantasy conception and animation bring to life a new story that has all of the elements of the old ones (with terrific cameo appearances) plus a few of its own.The scenes, characters and voices almost make us forget that we are not watching flesh and blood, and materialize a world that our dreams sometimes visit. Many comedies are poorly classified as such, since so few deliver more than an occasional titter. But this multi-level effort delivers plenty of sustained laughs for all ages.Mike Myers as the lead voice, the ogre Shrek, affects for some reason a Scottish accent, which left me thinking of him as a slightly larger and somewhat greener Robbie Coltrane - but he builds a believable character nonetheless. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is very mouthy, as one might expect, but still pleases rather than irritates.If you like to laugh and enjoy being taken to another world this is a movie not to miss."
915,Shrek,10,16 June 2001,Exceptional animation movie,"This is one of the best animation movie I ever saw! I don't want tell you more, just go and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go , and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go , and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go! And enjoy it!"
916,Shrek,10,15 June 2001,funny than I thought possible,"In a nutshell - this is quite likely the funnies movie I have seen in the last 5 years.  I laughed so hard I hurt.Be warned that if you are depressed when you go in, you sure won't be when you come out.  And beware of the scene with the princess and the bird; don't be drinking a coke when it comes on or you'll baptize the people in front of you."
917,Shrek,,14 June 2001,great for all ages!!!!!,"I loved this movie. ""Shrek"" was the best movie I've seen in ages. Mike Myers was wonderful. If you've seen any of Mike Myers work when you watch ""Shrek"" you can see some characters he's played in the past.Eddie Murphy is always a thrill. I'm not a huge fan of Cameron Diaz but I really liked her character in this. I also like her as the princess. When I saw this the first time we had been preparing for a production we were producing, I play a princess and the movie gave me alot of insight for the character. ""Shrek"" was a very touching film. It's really cool how it kept me and my 10 year old sister both totally interested.I give it two thumbs plus two big toes just cuz I only have two thumbs.....Great job! Jessi"
918,Shrek,10,7 June 2001,"In my past life, I was a fat b**tard!","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Shrek sure did exceed the expectations. I was expecting some immature comedy that vainly tried to re-capture the stunning success of Toy Story, but it was much more than that. The computer animation is breath taking, I would even say that it is better than Toy Story's, at least in some elements. The humans' faces, for example, was something that Toy Story never got quite right, but they look great here. The animals are amazingly realistic, too. They even managed to make a female dragon look sexy! Now THAT'S an accomplishment in animation science!(spoilers) There are a lot of themes presented in Shrek, the most prevalent of which is that of being yourself, loving yourself for who you are, and there's probably a bit of the old one about there being someone out there for everyone (Hey, if SHREK can find true love.). Sure, these are all clichés (and, technically, therefore can't officially be themes, I guess, but who's grading this? No one!), but they are presented in a hilarious and entertaining way, if not exactly original or even entirely inventive.
The plot is fairly simple, a bunch of fairy tale creatures are being banished by a prince for some reason, and they all wind up on the swamp property of Shrek, a fearful ogre who lives in the woods and feels too ugly to have contact with any other beings (much like Frankenstein's poor monster). Shrek goes to the prince to get the fairy tale creatures off of his land, who agrees as long as Shrek will travel to a far away kingdom and rescue a princess and bring her back so the prince can marry her. That's about the size of it, but what an adventure! There is also the excellent addition of a talking donkey (who is voiced by Eddie Murphy but looks like Chris Rock) who is Shrek's sidekick and friend throughout the movie.The fairy tale creatures are some of the best parts of the movie, there's something here from EVERYONE'S childhood. We see everything from the talking gingerbread man (`Do you know the muffin man.?') to Snow White and the Seven Dwarves to the talking string puppet who thinks he's a real boy. This is great stuff! There is even a great scene where they parodied (to spectacular effect) some of the shots from The Matrix, and this turns out to be one of the best scenes in the film. You almost want to get up and cheer at the way the princess kicks the asses of all of Robin Hood's men (how's THAT for irony!). Shrek and the donkey are stunned into hilarious silence.
The only scene that didn't seem to have a lot of thought put into it was where the princess is talking to the donkey after having turned into the hideous beast that she transforms into after sunset every night, and she is afraid of what Shrek will think if he finds out that she turns ugly every night. Has she not seen Shrek? He's an ogre! He's the loneliest ogre in the world, and she's worried because she turns into one of his species every night. Come on, princess, wake up and smell the pheromones! You'd think it would be obvious to her that he would be thrilled to learn of her nightly transformation.There is definitely no shortage of hilarious puns regarding the short stature of the prince. Besides that, James Bond could definitely take some serious knowledge from the effectiveness of the one-liners that seem to appear in Mike Meyers' movies (remember the succession of hilarious one liners in the head scene in Austin Powers?). I'm still not sure why it was so funny that the prince was such a little squirt, but there seemed to be no end to the laughs.However, the most effective and memorable element of the film is the romance that develops between the princess and Shrek. This romance would be obviously manipulative of the audience and therefore insulting if she had just fallen in love with her rescuer despite his abhorrent appearance, but her nightly transformations make the pair work very well. After Shrek has made it to hers and the prince's wedding just in time to stop her form marrying him, we are entreated to a charming scene (which includes the donkey riding the dragon and hilariously threatening the crowd with it as though it were a weapon - `I've got a dragon and I'm not afraid to use it!') which ends with the princess revealing her condition to Shrek for the first time. As she kisses Shrek, her true love, she lifts into the air, and the spell is lifted from her, as previously explained. I remember sitting there and thinking that the movie was about to be ruined because she would turn into a beautiful princess and Shrek would suddenly become her charming prince, and it was such a relief that this didn't happen!
If they had both turned into beautiful people, the message of the entire film would have been cancelled out, and we would be left with the feeling that poor Shrek could never find true love if he were an ugly ogre, and that no one can truly be happy unless they are beautiful humans. That would have really pi**ed me off. She asks Shrek if he'll love her even if she's not beautiful, and he says, `You are beautiful.' There is no way that this movie could have had a more uplifting and satisfactory ending than that, unless of course, it closed with the donkey and all of the fairy tale creatures singing `I'm a believer' in an excellent outdoor concert.This is a truly memorable film. It's got its share of childishness, but there can be no mistake about its quality. There is something here for everyone, and the message that it delivers is important in the society that we live in, which is disturbingly concerned with superficiality (hence the quality and success of American Beauty). Bring the kids, the parents, the grandparents, everyone."
919,Shrek,7,17 May 2001,Story takes Detour,"Disregarding the toilet humor, Shrek starts off with a great story. A libertarian ogre enjoys his solitude, until a lord in a quest for a perfect society, banishes all fairy tale creatures to his swamp. The ogre sets off to see the lord and re-establish his property rights. At this point for some reason the movie pretty much throws away this story line in favor of a very predictable one we've seen many times before. I still enjoyed the movie, but I would much rather have seen it follow the original plot line. Why did the lord feel banishing the fairy tale creatures would make society better? How did his subjects feel about this ""perfect"" society? We don't get any answers to these, all we get are crude jokes and a constant reminder that this movie was not made by Disney.Shrek could have been a great movie, but decided to take the low road instead."
920,Shrek,5,6 June 2001,Wait for the Video,"If you absolutely have to see this film, save yourself a little money, and wait for the video. The movie starts out slow and never does get going. I felt like the writers never decided whether they were writing for adults or children. More than once during the movie, I found myself thinking about what I was going to cook for dinner."
921,Shrek,8,4 June 2001,"Very entertaining, but minor bouts with language.","It's not often that you can take your little one to go see an animated movie and get caught up in the flick more than they.  Shrek is one such movie. Being both a big Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy fan, I wasn't disappointed at all in either voices (Mike has always done a great Scottish accent!)  You do, however, have to watch out for an occasional ""damn"" being thrown out, but it most likely will go right over your young one's heads.You will certainly fall in love with this movie and its delightful message/moral at the end."
922,Shrek,6,5 June 2001,Pretty good movie for youngsters,"Shrek ain't my normal cuppa tea, but it was strongly recommended by a respected colleague. So off I went to a local Odeon to check out this tale of yore.This was at 5 on a Sunday, but there were only about 50 spectators, all adults with young children, except for your fearless reviewer. Makes you think that reports of problems in the movie display industry are not exaggerated.If memory serves me right, Shrek is close to Schrech, the German word for terror or fright. This would hopefully refer to the ogre, not the movie itself.Anyway, it took a few minutes for me to get my head around the fact that I was about to spend almost an hour and a half watching some kinda cartoon, several decades since the last time.Having done that, I was soon enjoying the antics of Eddie Murphy. Incongruous though it seems, his 1990s street slang was a super fit for the ancient times. But Mike Myers was all over the place.Those who recall his excellent work in SNL still affectionately laugh at his language renditions in the Scottish retail store. But here he alternated between a little of the Highlands, and more of his birthplace in a suburb of Toronto.There were two flatulence jokes within seconds at one point. Guess that was a device to raise the attention levels of the nine-year-old boys. But this audience of children was strangely silent throughout most of the movie.There were some delightful notes of incongruity. Perhaps the best was that of the appearance of a French-accented Robin Hood. Weird stuff!
The fundamental point of the story --- not to judge by appearances alone --- was well made. And the ending was spectacularly done. Quite a surprise to me also, in that the fairy tale ending was not there.However, along with all of this mature understanding for diversity was a curious inconsistency. We may not have liked Lord Farquaad, but was it appropriate to fill the movie with jokes about his height and size? Surely our compassion should extend to the vertically challenged as well as the plain ugly?Anyway, I give Shrek a 6. By the way, the sunset outside the theatre was truly spectacular. A definite 10!!!"
923,Shrek,,6 June 2001,"""Shrek"" isn't ""Dreck""!","I was a little edgy about Dreamworks at first.  I don't know why, maybe their corporate logo had something to do with it.  Maybe their approach to being cute (a kid fishing from the moon) rather than majestic (like Disney, Fox, the WB or Universal) did it.  Turkeys like ""The Haunting"" didn't help, either.  Hell, that same movie cost over $90 million to make a house that wasn't scary, only to lose to Artisan's ""Blair Witch Project"", which cost under a million (and it wasn't scary, either...still happy I paid for ""The Iron Giant"").  After seeing ""The Road to El Dorado"", I guess my opinion about Dreamworks swayed a little.  Maybe the music by Elton John and Tim Rice, doing music together for the first time since ""The Lion King"" in 1994 helped. 
Anyway, I did like ""Shrek"".  It's not trying to be a formulaic ""prince and princess fall in love and get married"" movie.  As the trailers state: ""the prince isn't charming, the beauty isn't sleeping, and the hero is an ogre"". 
The various jabs at many fairy tales and nursery rhymes are very funny.  And some stories, if they're not actually 'fairy tales'.  There were so many, it's tough to keep count.  Look for spoofs of Snow White, Peter Pan, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the Gingerbread Man, Robin Hood, etc.  And it still has enough time to parody ""The Matrix.""  It also teaches a moral about prejudice.  We all feel for Shrek, when he tells Donkey *slight spoiler* that no one thinks well of him because he's an ogre, which everyone tends to think are big, stupid ugly monsters.  I guess not all ogres are evil beasts...  I suppose some mild profanity and a scene were we see Donkey leak out a fire gave this movie it's PG rating.  Also, there seems to be a new 'surefire laughs' gross-out gag.  In the mid-'90s, it was lighting farts on fire. Today, (2001) it's putting out fires with one's urine.  I wonder what other body function we can use on fires in the future...um...yuck.  Try not to think about that.  So, go see Shrek.  In the meantime, 'I have to save my ass.'"
924,Shrek,10,5 June 2001,Prince Charming... Ogre,"""Shrek"" is the best movie of the year so far. Ted Elliot's screenplay message of not judging people (or ogres) by what they appear is ""in your face"", funny, and truly touching. Not like this has any relevance to any of us living in a city like... LA. Elliot's words in concert with the direction and care of Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson make Shrek a special movie. Shrek, Princess Fiona, and Donkey are genuine characters that you care about. Mike Myer's Scottish Shrek voices the Ogre as one who is smart, brave, and lonely. Shrek knows what the game is, and how he fits in the grand scheme. There is a particularly moving scene while he and Donkey are looking at the stars, and Shrek voices the burden that he bears when it comes to people. Eddie Murphy as Donkey is fabulous as Shrek's sidekick and confidant. Murphy gets it right for the combination of smart-ass and compassion. Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona is perfect as the princess who has waited all her life to be rescued by her Prince Charming, only to saved by Shrek. And she also hides a secret. The end is a surprise and very cool one. Like the movie and it's story, what matters is a good heart and beautiful soul. Perhaps this is corny, and someone needs to remind us of that. Who better than ""Shrek""?"
925,Shrek,10,5 June 2001,What's the worst that could happen?,"There is no good reason not to see this movie.  When checking out the vote history on IMDB, I was astonished to see that anyone at all had rated this movie a ""1"". Whether it's your type of movie or not, this movie could never be considered ""awful"" under any rational rubric.This movie skillfully captures that which has been sorely lacking from the last offerings that Disney has given us: it is a movie which revels in its own cleverness, yet never at anytime ceases to poke fun at itself. The vocal acting is stupendous, regardless of whether or not you enjoy Myer's feigned scottish accent, and the character modeling is realistic and evocative. Most impressive is the way that actual features of Lithgow, Diaz, Myers, and Murphy are molded into those of their respective characters.
The writing is almost brilliant. It oscillates from low-brow to high-brow without effort, and earns hearty laughter either way. When characters in the movie do things that are annoying, something funny and violent usually happens to them to make them stop, granting all of us a great deal of gratification. If only the producers of Star Wars:Episode One had had a similar attitude towards Jar Jar...This movie is without comparison in the field of animated films. Many Japanese animes have produced stories and action which is as evocative as Shrek's, but their ways and means are far different. Shrek is a movie that never insults your intelligence (too much), never takes itself seriously, and insists on being an enjoyable film with depth of both drama and humor. Go see it: it's something you can feel good about in the morning."
926,Shrek,,4 June 2001,Amazingly Clever and Entertaining,"I am so happy about all the good reviews this movie is getting, and its ALL TRUE. Out of 10 professional critics in a magazine I recently read ""Shrek"" got 9 ""A's"" and only one B+.. This certainly is a movie that is so funny you can see over and over. The only somewhat negative thing I can say, is that the film starts out kinda slow, but works its way to become a wonderful film. VERY GOOD..Oh Yeah- Also watch for the ""that'll do, Donkey, that'll do"" line, like the ""that'll do, Pig, that'll do"" line from ""BABE"""
927,Shrek,8,4 June 2001,"Run, run, run, as fast as you can...","Easily the most sophisticated general audience release since ""Toy Story"", ""Shrek"" provides a welcome relief to parents who have had to endure a seemingly endless stream of drudgery the likes of which are personified by films such as ""The Road to El Dorado"" and ""Stuart Little"".  While the kids are treated to an ageless fairy tale (augmented with a 21st century touch of flatulence) and the old motto ""Don't judge a book by its cover"", the adults get solid sarcasm and parody.  ""Shrek"" is certainly walking through the woods with his ogre tongue firmly in cheek.  It is also entertaining to watch Eddie Murphy quietly reestablishing a career that seemed to peak in the 1980's.  Dr. Dolittles and Nutty Professors aside, his work in the ""PJ's"", ""Bowfinger"", and ""Holy Man"" show he is trying to mix the creative in with the studio money."
928,Shrek,6,3 June 2001,2.5 stars,"Excellent, cutting edge computer animation is somewhat dulled by a been-there, done-that plot in this film about an ugly ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) and his adventures to save a beautiful princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz).  Eddie Murphy, as the voice for the ogre's donkey sidekick, steals the movie and most of its laughs; Diaz terribly miscast as the voice of an appealing princess.  Film most clever in its satire on past animated movies, most notably of the Disney brand name."
929,Shrek,7,15 May 2001,"Light, fun comedy with strange plotting","Clearly, this is a film that wants to have it both ways--be a kid's film with enough ""adult"" jokes to keep older folks happy. There's enough charm and laughs to almost get away with it. I found the plot a bit oddly paced and just plain odd at times. For instance,  the motivation of why the John Lithgow king character sends the fairy tale characters to Shrek's swamp was a bit murky to me. And there were a few slow points. But overall, you'll get decent laughs out of the Disney references, potty/ass jokes and Eddie Murphy's antics. The Matrix joke was especially effective and out of the blue. Overall, a B-plus worthy effort. It will be a huge hit."
930,Shrek,7,28 May 2001,Only thing wrong with this film is that doesn't get a chance to fulfill it's full potential,"Shrek is a wonderful movie that pleases both adults as well as the young ones. It plays off all of the fairy tale stories ever made, and parodies most of them.Dreamworks manages to provide a great movies that has a story that people of all ages will enjoy. Filled jokes that will keep the children laughing and the adults hiding giggles of their own Shrek is a wonderful family film. The only problem is that it doesn't evolve as much as it could. With a short run time, less than an hour and a half, the story seems rushed.Despite this the film is a wonderful movie that is not to be passed up."
931,Shrek,5,28 May 2001,Boring and Crude,"Don't bring your kids to see this movie. Yes, it may contain elements that they have already been exposed to on TV or in school, but why do you want to pay to have their innocent world view damaged? What's wrong with protecting children from crude people? They will learn soon enough without you helping.Do you think your 5 year old needs to see a bird mommy get exploded, then having her eggs eaten for breakfast? The list goes on, but I think that ought to give you an idea what is in store if you go see it.
This is hyped-up garbage."
