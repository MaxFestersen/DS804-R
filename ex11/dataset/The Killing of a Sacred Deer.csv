0,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,4 November 2017,much more than a psychological thriller,"Saying that the ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is just a great psychological thriller is at least undermining... This film is full of brilliant metaphors, but you have to know Greek mythology and history to understand some of them. When Agamemnonas wanted to go to Troy to fight with his ships, there was no wind and he could't get there. So he asked the Gods to throw some strong winds, but the Gods replied that he had to sacrifice something in order to get the winds he desired, so they told him he had to kill his daughter. Agamemnonas thought about it and he decided to kill his daughter, but when he was just about to kill her, the gods transformed her into a deer, so he killed a sacred deer.That's where the title of the movie comes from and you can easily guess the reason..So this film is about choices, sacrifices and revenge.But revenge from the Gods. When Martin can bring sickness and death to Steven's whole family, in fact martin is in the place of a God from Greek mythology. And his duty is to bring the justice and punish those who overestimated their powers and tried to play gods( Steven went to do a surgery drunk)In addition to that, this great film of lanthimos, gives a harsh critic to the modern way of living in the western societies. Alienation, fake goals, fake relations and money that that bring comfort but not happiness.In conclusion it's a great film that gives you much homework to think about when you get home after you watched it and surely much more than just a great psychological thriller that many people believe it to be.."
1,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,3 December 2017,"Cold, stilted and irritatingly obtuse","I went into ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" knowing that it was based on an ancient Greek tragedy which I had not read and that the trailer was ...pretty weird. So I was braced for something more auteur and symbolic that I would have to retrospectively interpret and extract meaning from, not something immediately tangible or obvious.However, try as I might, there was not one meaningful thing I could extract from this ponderous, drawn out mess of a film. I am not familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos's previous work -I have not seen the Lobster- but I'm told TKOASD is very much in keeping with his stylistic quirks; Emotionally vacant, surrealist art installations masquerading as film.A brief, spoiler-free summary of the plot: A heart surgeon, his wife and two children are befriended/stalked by a mysterious teenager who's strange mannerisms belie a dark, twisted plan and a destructive supernatural power. The plot and its fantastical leanings didn't bother me. What did bother me was the awkward execution.The cast of one dimensional archetypes all ramble their lines in a robotic manner, their eyes fixed in a detached, glacial stare. It is impossible to connect with any of them on an emotional level, even when the stakes rise and certain characters are met with horrific choices, the focus seems to be less about conveying the emotional depth that a real person might plunge to in those circumstances, and more about favoring the artifice of the shot. Barry Keoghan's Martin -the malevolent teenager stalking the family- is perhaps the only character served well by this robotic approach. His monotone aloofness, combined with his shifty vacant eyes make him feel all the more disturbing and unpredictable.Colin Farrell on the other hand, gives one of the most stultifying performances of his career. His character, Stephen, a heart surgeon and father of two, is so utterly devoid of pathos, employing his frowny face and flat middle-class Dublin cadence to every line, he fails to make Stephen believable or likable, even when he's blubbering snot all over himself in one incongruously candid scene, it feels artificial and contrived, as in the next scene he goes right back to being a cold, miserable android again.Nicole Kidman does a better job with her material as Stephen's wife, at least her delivery is the least morose of the lot, but her performance is still frustratingly restricted in places where it should be amplified, making her mostly unsympathetic.Stephen's children, the innocent victims of Martin's vengeful plot, should surely have some element of likability if we are to feel any fear for their predicament, but alas they too are passive, unfeeling robots who fail to engage.The film instead relies on gimmicky mechanics to convey tension and dread where the stolid acting falls short. There are dozens of shots where the camera slowly zooms down long corridors or empty rooms, accompanied by screechy, dissonant sound effects as if trying to convince you that the dreary banality of what's unfolding on screen is actually threatening and you should be very afraid.The film is also full of pointlessly weird scenarios and obtuse dialogue that seem to be there solely for the purpose of making the viewer squirm uncomfortably. There are many bizarre references to menstruation and armpit hair, a pointless sex scene involving a nude Nicole Kidman pretending to be anesthetized so her pervert husband can get it up, and one particularly risible scene where Colin Farrell confesses to his young son that when he was a small boy, he happened upon his sleeping father and masturbated him until ""The bed sheets were covered in sperm"".The nonsense continues at a creeping pace until the under-whelming, implausible climax, which feels a poor reward for enduring what was essentially a 30 minute short film stretched into two hours. I don't think any amount of retrospective research on ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" will change my rating. One of the worst films of 2017."
2,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,6 December 2017,"What a mess, this film could not connect with the audience","First things first: I loved The Lobster. The Lobster was a comedy, sort of, and when the characters spoke with a very monotone voice and said and did things that normal people wouldn't do, that added to the comedy and it was a pleasure to watch that movie.Now, this movie is ""The Lobster 2"" in the sense that people still speak with a very monotone voice and say things they normally wouldn't. For example, during small talk at some party, the mother just casually mentions that her daughter had her first period. The daughter herself mentions that to a boy she just met later on in the movie. That resulted in the audience laughing at the movie.This is not a comedy. It is also not a horror movie. This is a drama or thriller with strong religious undertones. It is a mixture between the Binding of Isaac and the story of Job. Whatever supernatural being is responsible for punishing the two kids has a moral best described as ""an eye for an eye"". Something that I thought humanity would have overcome within the last 2000 years. This picture is completed by the ""happy end"", where the father simply kills one member of his family. This actually works in the sense that the punishment stops.This doesn't mix well with the bits that are (unintentionally?) funny. In fact, these bits (like the talk about her first period) doesn't add anything to the story.For me and the audience I was with, the movie failed. People left the cinema. I stayed, cause I wanted to give it a chance. But I was disappointed anyway."
3,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,29 November 2017,"First time writing a review, I just felt obligated to do it","***NO SPOILERS***If you're not one of those ""movie expert"" wannabes, who say bs like ""This is sensational piece of art"" when they don't even understand a movie, just to be different from others, and if you're not a masochist - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE. I feel real mental pain after watching 122 minutes of this thing. It makes no sense whatsoever. Only decent thing about this movie is acting, but the stupidity, that is the story, is easily overshadowing it. If you hate someone very much, recommend them this ""masterpiece"" and enjoy yourself knowing that it's the worst thing you could do to make their life miserable."
4,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,20 October 2017,Failed myth adaptation,"Myths were created to help human build and understand the model of surrounding world. 'The Killing of Sacred Deer' is too artistic to bother. It builds a dent in reality in which a lower deity (surgeon) accidentally kills father of a greater one. While making people believe that the characters are somewhat real, it combines the mythical sacrifice of Iphigenia with cliché of train dilemma (kill 3 people by inaction or pull a lever and decide who dies). Unfortunately the setting is so artificial that the movie completely fails to deliver a point and decides to abort any attempts of explanation leaving viewers in a limbo. It's gripping, but completely dry upon closer examination. 'The Saw' was more believable than TKoSD. Viewers can admire a glimpse of naked Nicole Kidman for this suffering though!Acting: 7 Plot: 2 Production: 7"
5,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,1 December 2017,Disappointment,"I would like to keep it as short as possible:It was the worst Nicole Kidman movie I ever watched. My wife and I went to watch it with great pleasure as we are both Nicole Kidman fans and admirer her previous movies.The story, progress and ending were totally absurd. There were many sexual scenes which are not necessary and not related with the story. She should not accepted such a bad scenario...It was totally lost of 122 minutes of my life."
6,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,8 November 2017,Guilty doctor must sacrifice a child to expiate his guilt,"It takes a Greek director  Yorgos Lanthimos  to revive the elemental power of Greek tragedy in a modern setting. Because this is such a primal story it could be the most powerful and disturbing film of the year. The characters speak in a kind of dead tone, usually on banal matters (like how waterproof a watch is). The music alternates eerie silences with harsh nerve-wracking strings and drums. Shots of surgery and blood churn the stomach. The widescreen settings have an amphitheatrical stretch. Alone among recent films, it sends you out in catharsis  ""calm of mind, all passion spent."" This film releases you, drained. A man's misdeed brings down a curse upon his entire house that only his own immense sacrifice can expiate. That's the Greek tragedy, beside which our mundane stories of simple guilt, rationalization, mercy, forgiveness, and even human justice  the business of cops and courts  dwindle into insignificance. This primitive drama involves a heart surgeon Steven Murphy and his ophthalmologist wife Anna. That is, the elemental force erupts in the seat of modern science, rationalism, humanity. The professional curers are profoundly afflicted. Their reason is helpless, irrelevant, once the old pagan gods have been stirred to ire. Dr Murphy was at least tipsy when his bungled surgery cost a man's life. Murphy has not openly accepted responsibility or expressed his guilt. But he did attend the man's funeral and stop drinking altogether. He also befriended the man's orphaned son Martin, whom he buys gifts and offers friendship as a sop to confronting his own guilt on any deeper level. Now Martin swells from orphaned son into preternatural agent of vengeance. For his father's death has proved a curse on his house too. He and his mother  in different ways  crave Dr Murphy to replace the dead man in their lives: ""My mom's attracted to you. She's got a great body."" This thuggish kid has an other-worldly understanding. He has become the seer, the oracle who alone fathoms the root cause of the Murphy curse and its resolution. If Murphy doesn't kill one of his children, his entire family will die. First they are paralyzed, deprived of appetite and will, then their eyes erupt in Oedipusian bleed, then they die. Of course these modern sophisticates deny this savage myth. Murphy in particular blames Martin for the curse he has only reported. Daughter Kim understands, because she wrote a paper on Iphygenia, Agamemnon's daughter whom he has to sacrifice to atone for having killed a sacred deer. Kim is attracted to Martin and offers herself to him. In him she senses a worldliness apart from the others. Having initially assumed kid brother Bob would go (""Can I have your MP3 when you die?) she then volunteers to be Dr Murphy's sacrifice. She knows the story.The Murphys' life is characterized by a kind of torpor. No-one has any zest for anything. The conversations are banal and wary. Dr Murphy and then Kim report her first period as if it were a head cold. All sense of the primeval has been lost. Anna feigns total anesthesia for her sex with her husband. His friend and anesthesiologist charges Anna a hand job for info. Facing the curse Steven tries coaxing, coercion, threats, even physical violence and the threat of murder, to shake the seer off his vision. Steven turns to a school counsellor for advice on which child to pick. Anna twigs to their predicament: ""Our children are dying, but yes. I can make you mashed potatoes."" She marshals the will to free Martin from her husband's futile abuse. Indeed both the doctor and the anesthesiologist each blame the other for failures in the operating room. This is the modern world with advanced science and culture but with stupefied emotions and a shallow sense of responsibility. Dr Murphy forbids smoking in the house, but his wife and daughter smoke outside. Martin accepts his recent addiction with the same resignation he seems to have accepted as his role of messenger from the gods, to bring Murphy to their harsh justice. This elemental tragedy is the prophet director's harsh judgment on a world that evades its guilt and responsibility by suspending all conscience, all sense of a higher purpose than the mundane and worldly. The modern news cycle allows no time for the eternal."
7,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,15 December 2017,"Weird, Intriguing but Absolutely Disappointing and Overrated","The renowned heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is married with Dr. Anna Murphy (Nicole Kidman) with two children, the young teenager Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and the boy Bob (Sunny Suljic) that are their pride and joy. E works with the anesthetist Matthew (Bill Camp) and recently he is dedicating attention to the teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan), whose father died in a surgery.

However, the screenplay holds the attention of the viewer that expects the clarification of the mystery. Unfortunatelly the conclusion is awful without any explanation for what is happening or who Martin is or has done. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
8,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,10 November 2017,The script-writer must have been about as intellectual as a lobotomized chicken.,"Perpetually early for the movies, I stand for a few moments in the cinema hall, overwhelmed with the crowd that forms a (typically British) queue at the ticket box. It is Halloween and this movie's trailer made it seem like the right choice for a spooky night. There is some kind of buzz in the air when the screening begins. A few moments later...happy chatter and munching are gone, everyone is focused, trying to figure out what the story-line is all about, what the GBP 12 for an adult ticket + GBP 7 for popcorn and coke went for.. a tragedy? No, a roadkill! No amount of expensive equipment can make up for the lack of plot! It just doesn't make sense... at all! Any of it! ""But it had scored so well on IMDb!"" - whines someone from the back row and I can feel their pain... it is everyone's pain... A collaborative exhaling in short puffs! What.a.waste.of.time! Lights are up as the movie ends... No-one's getting ready to leave - stuck in their seats people look around, then look at the screen again, expecting some scenes after the credits to put the whole movie into a different perspective, making it worth watching at least... To no avail."
9,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,25 November 2017,Pretentious and terribly directed.,"OK, I get the Greek mythology link in the title. That is pretentious for a start. But the film is completely confusing. Is it a horror, a thriller, a mystery? Are there special powers involved? Is the main character himself insane and much of the action his imagination? There are no hints at all. The characters are all brain dead. Hardly a meaningful statement or emotional reaction over 120 minutes. Close to the worst film I have ever seen. And at the ending will leave you completely unsatisfied."

11,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,19 November 2017,"Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos  continues to befuddle and anger audiences in attempting to become a new M.Night Shamalan (um, not a good thing at all)","THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017) * Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Barry Keoghan, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Bill Camp, Alicia Silverstone. Odd, strange and frankly taxing on the nerves sci-fi drama about the very wrong relationship between a teenage loner (creepy as f*** Keoghan) who gloms onto the cardiologist (Farrell in a truly one-note you wanna slap so-hard turn) who was responsible in the death of his father on the operating table unbeknownst to the doctor (at first) until it is revealed that the fate of his family will suffer the wrath of the mysterious boy. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos - who co-wrote the frustrating screenplay with Efthymis Filippou - continues to befuddle and anger audiences in attempting to become a new M.Night Shamalan (um, not a good thing at all) - with impossible silent situations and moments where you want to scream at the screen ""Are you ****ing kidding me?!!?"" An attempt at a parable from the darkest recesses of The Twlight Zone comes off more as a metaphor of ego and revenge."
12,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,14 December 2017,Dont waste your time on the worst movie! You can't get it back!,This movie was very disturbing that didn't have much of a plot line. It would play eerie music throughout the entire movie at parts that weren't even scary. The movie would jump from one thing to another. It was disorganized. Te characters acted inhuman and everything was said in a blunt way. The wasn't much acting nor any emotion.
13,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,30 October 2017,Even worse than The Lobster,"If you're a fan of The Lobster then you'll probably love this. I'm not so when into this with reservations. My wife and I hated it. At the end of the movie we looked at each other and said ""what was that all about"". As far as I can see the movie had no point and to have your actors be as stilted and wooden as they possibly could be really made it worse. Yes I know it was a revenge story but the characters were so boring it made it a real slog to get through. As I said to my wife while I usually like to adhere to the 3 strikes and you're out in this case 2 is more than enough to keep me from ever seeing one if his movies again regardless of how many critics think it's wonderful."
14,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,21 September 2017,Michael Haneke's Sophie's Choice... or Stanley Kubrick's Happiness?!,"Neither. This is a Yorgos Lanthimos joint all the way. But it's as powerful and piercingly original as a work of the aforementioned masters.The premise isn't as intriguing or clever as The Lobster, but the execution, oh boy... is even better. A horrific black comedy, a nail-biting thriller, and a compelling moral tale all at once. The entire cast is superb, but Barry Keoghan will be a star. Between this and Dunkirk, it's his year.Go watch it on the big screen. Experience it, then see it again, and let its brilliance wash over you. I don't say this often, but to me, this is an instant classic."
15,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,16 November 2017,One of the oddest movies of the year,"This has to be one of the weirdest movies I have seen in quite a while.Based on ""Iphigenia in Aulis"", the acting is excellent yet the plot and the ending is rather bizarre. The story revolves around teen aged Martin who puts a mysterious curse on the Murphy family because an apparent mistake the Murphy patriarch, a surgeon, made earlier on Martin's father who died during surgery.All the characters' behavior in the story is odd and frequently unbelievable."
16,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,26 May 2017,A psychological thriller like they should be,"This slow paced psychological thriller embodies everything that is key to making the viewer feel a lively and frightening experience: it is beautifully shot, with very talented actors, a soundtrack that will give you chilling goosebumps, and an enigmatic plot. While some parts might feel slow or superfluous, this is easily compensated by the rising tension. Moreover, the fright is ingeniously generated through the actors' astute portrayal of character turmoil, and not cheaply made jump-scares or gratuitous violent scenes. In a way, The Killing of A Sacred Deer reminds me of Cape Fear (1991). Great movie if you like biting your knuckles in apprehension and get your nerves all twisted up, not so great if you are searching for fast-paced graphic experience (although the movie contains some instances of sexuality and gore)."
17,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,13 December 2017,Shocked,"Im shocked how Nicole Kidman and Collin Farrel Worked in this terrible movie.
I love psychological thriller but this is not one of them is just bad ( trying my best to control myself and not saying any bad words )
The kid ( the evil one ) he is super annoying , terrible acting .
the ending is just pathetic the whole story and characters doesn't seem real at all.
their behavior is super forced and acted looks like a mexican telenovela or even worse because at least mexican telenovelas has action and drama.
please don't waste your time on this is just bad bad !!!!!"
18,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,1 December 2017,Do yourself a favour- never see this movie,"This is the first time I have reviewed a movie on IMDb but we disliked this movie so much I wanted to do the world a favour and warn everyone about it - this movie is awful. Yes the acting is good - we went to see if because it had Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman. It is loosely based on the Greek tragedy of Iphigenia but some versions of that story had a happy ending where Artemis sacrifices a deer in place of Iphigenia who is the daughter of Agamemnon. Hence the name of the movie. This movie is dark and weird and has no redeeming features. The plot is ridiculous and the music is manipulative. We were going to walk out half way but we thought it would get better. But it just got worse. I don't want to write any spoilers but please Don't SEE IT. Pull out your toe nails instead, it will be more fun."
19,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,11 November 2017,Worst movie I've ever seen,"The worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. Save your money and don't waste your time on this one. They tried to make a film noir, but all they made was a film de merde! It was slow moving and pretentious and the only reason I stuck it out was because i spent so much to see it at the cinema, waiting and hoping for it to get better, but it never happened. I would have given it a 0 if possible, but the lowest score allowed is a 1, so it gets a 1. Slow, boring and terrible sums it up! Don't waste your money or time."
20,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,14 December 2017,Sadly it is waste of resources!,"The director may be thinks that an eye for an eye the only solution to all problems or may be life is not profound to have it more deeper understandings any how in the end results is a shallow production that can not go beyond cliché.
I gave 2 star only for the beauty of cinematography for getting really good pictures. So well done to creative director and art director. But if you consider the waste of resources it is even a lot for this film. I am very sorry for all the time and the money spend to this film during production. Surely it could be used for a much better purposes."
21,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,14 December 2017,Waste of time,I don't get any part of this movie at all. Either i am the dumbest person on earth or the writer.
22,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,15 December 2017,Masturbatory obsessed delusions of a damaged brain,"Pretentious garbage like this really gets my goat as do all the so much more intelligent than us reviewers who ""GET IT"" and disparage others who dont know of the Greek legend of Iphigenia of which the story is meant to be based on I believe and just say the truth and say ""its boring"" Like the reviewers who have posted paragraphs of existential bullshit and hidden meanings...You simply cant polish a turd!The director is obviously some kind of sex pervert or deviant obsessed with ""wanking"" of various kinds , foot fetishism and pseudo-erotocism so my question is why didnt he just do the honest thing and make a porno!The music is jarring in the extreme as is the whole thing; its so bizarre that the audience were laughing at the most inappropriate times - the acting i couldnt actually make out if it was bad or was meant to be so wooden at times for effect (I give the benefit of doubt and surmise the latter) - its was as if two robots were speaking at each other in many scenes.I suppose its like everything these days - like art itself - in my mind if anyone can make it like Tracy Emmins garbage they call art then it really isnt art - if you can paint a Jack Vetriano or a Turner then it is art and anyone could have made this but in the modern world the idea of shocking the viewer seems to be what defines art, television, cinema etc. All you need to do is crap on a piece of paper and it could be called art by the arty farty up their own kazoo types that inhabit the crevices of IMDB! The world is now so full of people who know the price of everything but the value of nothing and this director exemplifies this with this turgid, pretentious bag of ordure!"
23,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,14 December 2017,"Bad acting mind-numbing scenario, boring setting","I'm sure they're all embarassed to appear in this p* o*s of a movie - the ""scaryness"" is done by using droning sounds and setting it in a hospital ""UUeeew, scary!"", NOT!
The acting is horrible, I'm surprised anyone got paid for doing that, the actions totally irrational, and the pretentionsness is abysmal. Avoid! This isn't direct-to-Dvd it's direct to wastebin."
24,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,29 November 2017,Tedious,"Really cross that I wasted the last 2 hours watching this self-absorbed nonsensical yet depressing drivel. Ironically, and equally annoyingly, I now have to write some meaningless nonsense myself in order to get to the minimum word count to submit the review. What, still not enough text? What more can I say? The film is not worth writing about which is why my review was so short. I wish I had done my tax return instead, it would have been more enjoyable and I would not still have my tax return to do. To sum up, my advice is, don't watch the film because it is awful."
25,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,18 December 2017,Easy film...NOT!,"I don't want to write any criticism for the movie. Most good reviews have done it better than me. What I would like to write has to do with basic understanding of one particular kind of movies.There are movies which are self-explanatory and there are movies like this one. I find it sad that a lot of critics have the words ""obtuse, weird, no meaning, garbage, etc "". I am Greek so I am familiar with the context and the generic idea behind the movie but even in other complicated movies (directors like Aronofsky, Bunuel, etc have created movies like this one (and because i want to avoid haters, i am NOT making a comparison between Lanthimos and those guys)), I always, ALWAYS thought and read before I judge. It's one of those movies that you need to think and even by thinking you may still not be able to understand it. You may need to read before passing any judgment. But for me at least this is the beautiful thing with these kind of movies. They educate you. You evolve as a personality because of them. To rephrase it, you may evolve as a personality because of them if you let yourself open. If you baptize the movie as crap just because you found the acting ""weird"" or ""empty"" without thinking why the director choose this approach(?), then you have barricaded yourself under the safety of your own little world.Of course if you believe that a movie is good only if you are able to understand it without the need of any reading, considerable thinking etc. then of course this is not a movie for you and you have excluded yourself from a vast collection of amazing directors and movies but that's just personal preference. There is always a new Saw movie coming along :) !"
26,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,14 December 2017,"yep, its one of those where u can only shake your head","Not really a fan of Kidman, and this movie is a great example why, I think she donned her Stepford Wive's persona for this one...again.
A heart surgeon has secret meetings with a teenage boy after unsuccessfully operating on his father. The boy somehow makes the Dr's whole family sick as an act of revenge for drinking on the job, Dr must choose which family member to sacrifice...which he does, randomly. During the film, these's lots of hidden messages in the imagery that you must decipher, and most likely will be attributed to the teenager being an incarnation of the devil, or a hundred other ways that it could be interpreted, of which the director will no doubt take credit for, more ambiguity the better for an artsy film, which is really means being too lazy to figure out a more plausible reason that these events could even be put on screen. The dots do not connect, the acting is definitely questionable, and the plot is just hot air, camera work is interesting, a lot of the placement is following the action, as if hovering from behind, similar to 'Birdman'. The film did have me interested in the outcome, I did want to know the reasoning behind all the sickness, and how he was able to predict it, but for a film to be worth watching, it must address it's central question, at least try and answer it, but it doesn't. So yeh it's an 'Art' film, because you have to decide yourself what it all meant, or be able to recount decades of cinematic references that the director was targeting to unravel all the hidden meaning, which may or may not lead to a logical ending. But me expecting a logical satisfying ending to a film (to which there will be no part 2) is no doubt looked upon as ignorant and docile to all the film noir aficionads's. But I felt ripped off after sitting through that, in a really classic 'film noir' way. I once watched a film where a guy took a crap on a wooden cross, and through the wonders of time lapse photography, a rose eventually grew out of the crap, that was at least slightly satisfying to endure, this one wasn't."
27,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,5 November 2017,What is This?,"Yorgos Lanthimos directed The Lobster which is one of my favorite movies. Lanthimos also directed Dogtooth which is an interesting movie, but it's not as good as The Lobster.I've been on the lookout for what Lanthimos was going to do next. When I first saw the trailer for The killing of a Sacred Deer, I was excited, and I couldn't wait to see the movie.I've noticed that Lanthimos loves to tell ambiguous stories, I don't mind it. The Lobster's ambiguous ending was great and so was Dogtooth's, but I think Lanthimos got a little carried away with The Killing of a Sacred Deer.Nothing makes any sense in this movie. The pacing is slow and I know that's the general feel with Lanthimos movies, but this one takes the cake for being one of his most boring and dull films ever.The opening was good and I was interested in the characters because I wanted to know what was going on, but the movie just kept going, and by the midpoint, I just didn't care anymore.The only thing that mainly held interest with this dry film was the directing. When I looked at some of the shots and angles the director chose to use, my mind immediately went to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. This movie is skillfully directed for the most part, and they reminded me of Kubrick, but also, some of the shots in here did look a bit sloppy.I loved Colin Farrell in The Lobster, but in this, he comes off as stale and weird. I'm pretty sure that Lanthimos gave Farrell a direction to go in as a character, but I believe that the direction was bad, and it seemed like Farrell was reading his lines from a cue card most of the time.Nothing is explained here. I don't need to be spoon-fed information, but nothing in this movie makes any sense.This is a pretty pointless movie, all it has going for it is the directing, the weirdness, the music, it looks cool, and that's pretty much it. I'm really disappointed with The Killing of a Sacred Deer.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YxcHUXGnk0"
28,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,5 November 2017,A film for masochists,I love a good thriller. However I wouldn't go to see The Snowman one of my favourite detective psychological thrillers because of the way it had been truncated. The Vue cinema in which I saw The Killing of a Sacred Deer last night puts you in the mood to see such a film. It's like being at the dentist for half an hour before the film starts. There is a crescendo of drill sounding vibrations advertising how lucky you are to be in their cinema. Then after a final explosion of noise the film starts. There is blackness around thirty seconds of silence and we are taken into a heart operation. Having a by-pass operation myself I found this interesting. Let me say that the acting was mostly very good especially that of Barry Keoghan. If you have masochist trends I am sure you will like this film. If you don't give the film around 30 minutes before deciding if you are going to walk out. Let me say that if you watch it to the end and afterwards you say you enjoyed it. May I suggest that you go and see a psychiatrist.
29,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,3 November 2017,Flick doesn't make any sense despite good acting,"I went to see the movie because it stars Nicole Kidman. With her and Colin Ferrell, how could anything go wrong? But it did. The flick seemed pointless - meandering without any direction or sense of finality. It seemed as if it was going one way and then stopped and went a different direction. I saw a clip on an interview of Nocole and she was asked what the scene was all about. She answered that she didn't know. Now if she didn't know, then how is the audience to know? The only reason I gave this flick 3 stars was because the cast did the best they could with it but otherwise I can't recommend anyone watch the flick."
30,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,9 July 2017,A thriller whose basic plot is as bad as a B-Horror movie,"I went to see this movie with a couple of friends at a special screening, we are all fans of Lanthimos previous works, but when this movie ended we looked at each other and chuckled nervously in disappointment. A few people in the audience even left immediately after the end and one man a few minutes later gave the movie an ironic clap, people laughed. It was that bad.The movie starts out really strongly, with all the daily awkwardness in human interactions Lanthimos can so easily portray and reshape. There's mystery, intrigue, the characters develop as the movie progresses, it delves into wider themes: the nuclear family, growing up, sexual awakenings and revenge. It is obvious Lanthimos sought to portray a ""what if"" situation in the movie that would make the viewer reflect on this themes, but the plot construction and thriller-like soundtrack and filming leaves the viewer demanding answers (like you normally get in the end of a thriller) or a twist. Instead the movie goes bland, it's extremely anticlimactic to the point of being comparable to bad horror movies where the intrigue goes nowhere. A lack of answers to basic questions as to the function of Lanthimos universes is usual in his movies, but here it doesn't work: this isn't a dystopian family or society, the movie is set in a world that feels like our own, yet we aren't given any explanations for the surreal undertones this world can have."
31,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,2 January 2018,Curse or justice?,"There are a lot of people that I know, who are going to regret watching this film. Only a few would enjoy a film like this. The reason (I believe) is that not everybody enjoys watching films that may trouble his mind or those films which contain ambiguous endings.The film has great screening and great picture, although the ""zoom-in"" & ""zoom-out"" effect at some extent was tiresome. The plot is about, 
-soft lies among the ""perfect"" family environment, 
-guilt that pushes into fake acts of kindness and 
-the classic meaning of the phrase ""revenge is a dish best served cold"". 
The last one in the universe of the movie has an unavoidable strength - like the power of fate which many may believe - and causes a very strong moral dilemma.Yet not all the parts of the plot could be explained, some acts may be regarded as devine or simply irrationalIt is not so fun watching a drama like this, but being in the right mood this film could be as amusing & fascinating as a classic tragedy."
32,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,25 December 2017,i took the effort to update my old account to rate this bad,"Overall the movie is not bad, the players are ok. I get that the martin figure is supposed to be empty in a way, but the way this is presented you could put a homer simpson in the play and get the same end result. just bad directing. the story could be so much more but it just lacks."
33,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,8 November 2017,Laughably bad,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer is this year's Birdman. If you have half a brain and any self-respect, then you won't bother taking in this dud of a film. It's truly bad. I don't know where to start: the wooden performances, the stilted dialogue, the poorly-developed characters and storyline -- nothing is good about this movie. Even the stellar cast can't save it. Run, don't walk, away from The Killing of a Sacred Deer."
34,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,11 November 2017,It's All Greek to Me,"(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5 stars) GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A contrived updating of a family in crisis that fails due to bad writing and absurd situations.SYNOPSIS: Using Greek mythology as its source, a father must make an ultimate sacrifice.JIM'S REVIEW: Oh, those Greeks and their tragedies! They love to wallow in guilt and despair. That avant-garde wonder boy, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, is upon us with his latest sojourn into absurd irony, The Sacred Killing of a Sacred Deer. His independent film tries to connect the legend of Iphigenia with a modern day family (a lofty goal), and fails miserably, despite the mostly positive reviews that this movie is garnering. (For those unaware with that mythological story-line, let me digress: King Agamemnon is punished by the vengeful goddess, Artemis, for accidentally killing a deer. To appease the gods, he must choose to sacrifice his eldest daughter, Iphigenia, to end his curse.)￼This allegorical film unfolds, ever so slowly, in its tale of crime and punishment. Dr. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) befriends a confused teenage boy named Martin (Barry Keoghan). His motive and also Martin's behavior are bizarre from the start and we learn more of their true connection about a half hour into the film when the plot finally kicks in. No spoilers here, although it is quite tempting to reveal some details if that will persuade you to avoid this Trojan Horse. (But I resist, nevertheless.)Up to this point, moviegoers suffer more than the film's poorly drawn characters. Enduring the flattest of line readings and listening to the endless banalities spoken in the most unbelievable dialog one could ever experience in any motion picture, the film piles on more surreal circumstances with the good doctor as his family's health conditions worsen, with no possible explanation given. Now let me share a few prime examples of the film's bons mots:""If you don't stop playing games, I will shave your head and make you eat your hair. I mean it. I will make you eat your hair.""""I won't let you leave until you try my tarts.""""Our children are dying, and yes, I can make you some mashed potatoes.""Definitely a food fetish somewhere, but let's move on...￼It should be noted that the cast performs their roles with some semblance of credibility. Mr. Farrell, a talented actor who is unafraid to take risks, is misdirected to act cold and emotionless for most of the film. It creates an unreal tone that undercuts the dramatic potential of his character and the story itself. The actor finally is allowed to react in the third act and he is most effective. Mr. Keoghan is impressive and supplies the perfect foil as a nerdy yet menacing avenger. Nicole Kidman adds depth to a standard grieving mother part. As their children, Raffey Cassidy and Sunny Suljic give respectable performance from the inanity they are handed by the director and his co-writer, Efthymis Filippou. But it is really Mr. Lanthimos who disappoints with his words and actions. (However, he does wisely lets cinematographer, Thimios Bakatakis aim his camera and create some strong visual images that almost hide the film's flaws...almost.)￼Metaphors and heavy-handed symbolism runs rampant amid conversation about menstruation, expensive watches, and donuts. Gratuitous nudity is also thrown in as a wake-up call for any dozing members of the audience. (Lest we question this already wonky plot and the direct inspiration of Iphigenia, the director includes a scene mentioning the A+ grade Kim earned from her report on that very topic...subtle, it's not.) All of this leads to a unsatisfying climax and a very dramatic but polarizing denouncement.￼That said, let me now succinctly go into the C- grade this film earned from this reviewer. (Alas, if only Kim wrote the screenplay as well!) The film has adequate production values, serviceable direction, very bad dialog, a far-fetched plot, and a fine cast that is trapped in a laughable script. ￼Yes, sacrifices will be made, but mostly by the movie-going audience as they waste their precious time and hard-earned money on this dud. The Sacred Killing of a Deer is intellectually and emotionally inert. As revenge thrillers go, this artsy-fartsy misfire proves that the gods (and the filmmakers) must be crazy."
35,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,26 November 2017,Tradedy of Sacred Proportions... Mash Potatoes anyone?,"From the opening shot of open heart surgery being performed with Schubert's Stabat Mater in the background we are pulled into a surreal and dark world inhabited by strange characters. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is the latest film by Yorgos Lanthimos whose previous work was the excellent and well received The Lobster. There are similarities between the two films, such as the deadpan delivery of dialogue and elements of dark comedy, a common thread in Lanthimos work, but The Killing of a Sacred Deer is not The Lobster.The film takes us into the life of renowned heart surgeon Steven Murphy played by Colin Farrell and his relationship with his wife Anna (Nicole Kidman), son Bob (Sunny Suljic), daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and teenager Martin played by Barry Keoghan. It is the relationship between Steven and Martin that leads Steven (a man of science) into a world of chaos and dilemmas. The story is loosely based on the Greek tragedy of Iphigenia, which involves a death of a sacred deer, though the deer is more metaphorical here. The film excels in its casting with Farrell's restrained anger and agony complimenting Kidman's piercing, collective matriarch, but it is worth the ticket price alone to see Keoghan's performance of Martin. He is unsettling, ruthless, vulnerable and mesmerising to watch, the scenes in the basement showcasing his talent.The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a strange film, it cannot be classed as a black comedy, or a art house film nor a horror, there are scenes reminiscent of Kubrick with its long shots and chilling music, but it also contains Lanthimos deadpan delivery, The film leaves you with a dilemma, do you care enough of the characters to want to watch the film? yes and no, but do you want to see what happens in the end? Yes, yes you do."
36,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,2 December 2017,"WOW terrible movie, get your $17 money back! Ladybird awesome","$17, I can't believe this movie is terrible. The movie didn't scare me at all. The acting was so mediocre, robotic voice, and too long. F**k eye for eye. It was like watching Shinning, The others, and The Good Son in a bad way. After the big shot, people started to talk behind me not sure what was going on. I wanted to leave. The main actors didn't make the film any better. Supposedly Lobster is a lot better than this. This movie doesn't deserve to be seen. I don't care if this is artsy or a metaphor. Psychological horror my ass. Ancient Greek play doesn't deserve awards. $$$ Get Your MONEY back ASAP. Walk out, Get out, and stay out"
37,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,29 November 2017,An outstanding film that I'll never want to see again,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, is well-shot, adeptly acted, intensely written, and beautifully unsettling. An outstanding achievement by any metric. And I never want to see it again.From the opening shot, the film wears its tone not only on its sleeve, but also on its chest, face, and everywhere else: Its gonna make you uncomfortable. From the haunting score that seems to creep its way into every scene, to the awkward and robotic characters, to the downright scary Martin (played excellently by Barry Keoghan), the movie feels 'off.' We've seen this ""seemingly perfect upper- class family has a darkness that tears them apart"" type story before, but never so viscerally displayed as it is here. If the characters' inhuman mannerisms, conversations, and actions aren't unsettling enough, the film also delivers enough on-screen gross outs to hammer home a truly affecting experience. The film is objectively well-shot, and delivers a capable, if slightly subdued plot, while building to a frightening conclusion. It's not a horror movie sort of frightening either, but more of a, ""I can't believe I'm about to watch this"" feeling.I know that's a tough sell. The Killing of a sacred Deer is not going to make you feel good. The film is filled with an overarching, all-consuming darkness that lingers even after it's over. Still, it's a truly unique and deeply affecting film that's worth watching, even if only once."
38,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,24 September 2017,A bizarre folk tale which leaves you unsatisfied!,"Going to the cinema with high expectations was surely not the right thing to do. After the director's marvellous masterpiece ""The Lobster"", I expected a bigger movie - bigger in direction, screenplay, actor ensemble, and budget - since The Lobster received many accolades and an Oscar nom for best screenplay! However, his new movie seemed as if it was actually filmed before ""The Lobster"" - a dull, white and unappealing setting (mostly the hospital), not an ensemble cast or switching scenes + an unattractive and annoying young boy as the young protagonist.I actually watched it till the end with enthusiasm because of Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman - I really like their work and acting and they never disappoint. Also, hail to Nicole for having such a great year ahead! They had some great scenes together which make the movie worth to watch. The most annoying part must be the recurring unsettling & loud orchestral music to force the effect of: ""Hey, you are not watching a slow-paced drama with no elements of thriller or action, it is going to be so exciting and spooky right now"". ...and the ""bloody violence"" or scary, spooky scenes never came, actually. Wished Nicole Kidman had more scenes, though. She was too passive. I wanted her to smack the boy or do the final act herself which I won't tell ya not to spoil the ending.I hope we get more lobsters in the future than deer - they were not so tasty, after all!"
39,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,8 September 2017,Alert to mumbled dialogue you must hear to understand ending,"I give this a rating of 7 because the film held me spellbound throughout and the acting was great. But the flaw of it is a common one in American films these days. There is one scene where you have to stay alert for, as it's crucial to understanding the ending, and the common flaw comes into play here: the dialogue becomes breathlessly mumbled and incredibly fast. The spoiler alert is me playing it safe, as I want to let you know the scene to listen hard to. It's when Colin Farrell's character enters his child's hospital room and finds young Martin at the bedside. Listen carefully to what Martin says before leaving. I've docked the rating of three points because of this frustrating thing, but if you're hearing's good, it's a very spellbinding film."
40,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,12 November 2017,an engaging absurdist tale of atonment,"Absurdism is an art-house genre that messes with our brains by turning logic on its head. The filmmaker scatters a few clues throughout the film and leaves the audience to make whatever sense of it they can. A superb example is The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), a film full of conflicting clues that will make many viewers wonder if they are watching a supernatural horror, a psychological thriller, or a black comedy.The bare bones of the story are easy to describe but their meaning less so. Successful heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) saves many lives but one day he operates after a couple of drinks and the patient dies. With life and death in his hands, an occasional failure is normal. Some years later Steven spends time with his daughter's friend, the loner Martin (Barry Keoghan) who says he wants to be a cardiologist. Martin ingratiates himself into Steven's family and begins a relationship with the surgeon's daughter. When Steven tries to stop all contact, Martin reveals that Steven killed his father so he must kill one of his own family or all of them will die. Inexplicable symptoms appear in his son and daughter which force Steven to make a horrific decision.The narrative is weird enough but its presentation gives the film an extraordinary atmosphere of horror. The word Sacred in the film's title is the first clue that this story occupies a space beyond logical realism, somewhere in the eye-for-an-eye cosmos where a wrong must be held to account. Absurdism frees the filmmaker from conventional logic to make the audience question their taken- for-granted world: like, why should a surgeon be allowed to not atone for a tragic mistake? The filming style accentuates the outer-worldliness of what we see: subjects are framed to look small against massive walls; panoptic shots render humans as trivial objects from a universal gaze, while some tracking shots feel like the camera is running along the ceiling looking down on human panic.While the camera creates the visuals, the performances portray humans being under the control of an unknowable force. Outwardly refined and successful, the Murphys are strange people. Steven and wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) deliver deadpan dialogue and wooden body language, and their sex life relies on one of them imitating a comatose patient. As bizarre symptoms appear in their children and medical tests fail to find a cause, Steven turns on Martin like an animal caught in a trap. When science cannot help, he knows that a higher force is in control. There is no logic in what is happening and no causal link can be found. Brilliant photography and powerful acting combine to continually raise the psychological tension to a bizarre finale.Absurdism often depicts a form of moral dystopia; it is also the code for understanding Sacred Deer. Some will see Martin as an evil force; others will see this as a psychotic episode or maybe it's just natural justice being served. But the film remains in the moment: never questioning why things are happening, always mired in its own experiential strangeness. More than anything else, it is this lingering quality that makes it an engaging and memorable film."
41,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,11 November 2017,"Mysterious, disturbing, intelligent, unconventional and... funny?","The Killing of a Sacred Deer is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and made by the studio A24... That should tell you all you need to know about the movie. If it doesn't, I'll elaborate. Yorgos Lanthimos, director of the good but overrated The Lobster, has teamed up once again with Colin Farrell for this movie. And what a movie it is.First of all, the acting is great. Nicole Kidman and Barry Keoghan are very good but the scene stealer is one of the best working actors today , Colin Farrell. He gives the same kind of emotionless / hilarious performance as in The Lobster.Then, there's the story. TKOASD's story holds up really good, even though it's really metaphorical. The movie doesn't get lost in its metaphors, and stays on track all the way through even on surface level. The story is extremely suspenseful, mysterious and well done with good twists and turns, that really kept me guessing till the end.I love the movie's style. Its music, dark atmosphere and great camera-work all come together to make an excellent movie. The tracking shots are really great.What makes the movie most entertaining aside from the mystery, which is the main aspect, is the way the characters act. Their conversations are emotionless, blunt, superficial and surprisingly hilarious. I found myself laughing many times at how absurd and hilarious what Colin Farrell was saying (with a straight face) was. Now, this is by no means a comedy. It's a suspenseful psychological thriller that sometimes has a comedic tone. As you can imagine, it's hard to juggle two tones that are so different, but I thought it was extremely well done. It was only in one or two scenes that I felt, the switch of tone was awkward, ninety percent of the time, it was done perfectly with some great pacing. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a great psychological thriller We should encourage A24 for making original and unconventional film making like this."
42,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,11 November 2017,Yorgos Lanthimos strikes a strange note again,"I think its safe to say that The Killing of a Sacred Deer is the weirdest film I have watched this year. Is it good or bad weird, in my opinion it's bad. The main issue for me is some of the implausible conversations between the characters, talking about watches, the menstrual cycle of daughter and comparing armpit hair. Another annoyance is how the main characters behave when major incidents happen. For instance, the daughter is shouting in distress downstairs, but the mother continues to make the bed upstairs, I found that implausible. This odd behaviour by the husband (Colin Farrell) and wife (Nicole Kidman) repeats throughout the film. You find yourself constantly asking why would they say or do that? I won't even mention the strange sex scenes, although they are tame compared to Lanthimos's second feature Dogtooth. I have watched some strange and wonderful films in my time (Bad Boy Bubby is my favourite), unfortunately this is not one of them."
43,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,26 December 2017,A very strange movie,"This movie is really weird. If you've seen the trailer you know already most of the themes that are explored in this movie (with the sole exception of the ending). Which is pretty disappointing. That's not how you're supposed to make a trailer.When I said that the movie is weird I meant it. The ambiance is very strange and can only be described as ""autistic"" (and no, this is not a joke). At the beginning of the movie all of the characters act as if they're on the autism spectrum. All the protagonists talk as if they're robots, completely devoid of anything that could be described as an emotion. As the movie progresses and as things start to escalate the protagonists finally start to act like normal human beings. It's highly likely that this was done intentionally but I found it to be a little ""gimmicky"".The one thing that the movie has going for it are the totally ridiculous dialogues. I know, this is supposed to be a horror movie but some of the dialogues in the movie were so bizarre that they're more akin to comedy. 
Many of the funniest dialogues were even exaggerated due to the contrasting presentation of the actors. Here are some of my personal favorites:
""I won't let you go until you taste my tart""... (obvious double-entendre)
""My girl started menstruating last week""... (WTF?!)
""Can you take off your shirt and show me?""... (said the kid to the doctor)
""I will make you eat your hair!""... (spoke the father to his son)
And that's not even all of it. There is this weird scene where the protagonist tells his son a ""secret"". Believe me when I tell you this; it's quite messed up (the story that he tells him).There was a lot of suspense but I can't help but feel confused. I don't quite get the movie to be perfectly honest. I think it was too artsy fartsy but maybe I'm just missing something. Who knows?Final verdict: I personally couldn't wholeheartedly recommend the movie but I do respect the execution of the director. If you're into weird movies you can give it a watch but otherwise I'd advise against it."
44,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,17 December 2017,disturbing,"I hated this movie so much , one of the most irritated and awkward movies i'v ever seen .. non sense story and a not necessary ending .. though the trailer looks sick and disturbing yet i was anxious to watch it but i regret it now .. 
the teenage boy martin nailed the character .. its meant to be a sick minded kid who's terribly annoying and he played the role well , he just annoyed me .. 
i don't get that overweight anesthesiologist and his sick desires of pleasure seeking and the wife who gone along with it .. those kind of parts are uncalled for ..
i don't get the movie , does it talk about super powers of letting people die , or a stupid family who had no problem of killing their own little son to satisfy some maniac teenager .. 
if the movie wanted to give indignation , it sure did , succeeded in this matter."
45,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,14 December 2017,WTF?,"If you somehow liked The Lobster, you will probably like this garbage. If on the other hand you thought The Lobsta was utter blank blank blank, you will think the same of this. The Lobsta should have been called, The Stinky Jellyfish, and this should have been called The Killing of the Sacred Hollywood Idiot. This movie was so bad only potheads would like it, and that's only if they were even more stoned than they were when they watched The Lobster. Colin, what were you thinking doing this movie but I said that when he was in The Lobster as well so it went on deaf ears. He essentially was the same deadpan character in both movies. This must have been expensive for Hollywood to have to give everyone who entered the theaters a gram of weed so they could get through this movie. It must have been produced in Colorado. Holy moly, this movie was just plain bad. Bad acting, terrible plot, stupid ending. All the ingredients to make you good and sick."
46,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,11 November 2017,"What a disappointment,","I saw this film yesterday, within the panorama for European film festival in Cairo, Egypt And i was greatly disappointed...for a film to win in a renowned festival like Cannes ,it has to have brilliant elements,which this film sadly came short of Slow motion, boring ...un necessary nude scenes..that could have been avoided easily without harming the course of actions nor the script..dull film...silly scenes..allow conversations..i fell asleep literary towards mid film... Apart from acting of main characters Nicole Kidman and ..collin Farrel the rest of actors ..had average level of acting nothing amazing . The lobster ..was by far better ,,original and more creative in all aspects than this film ( same director) This film is a revival of the Greek mythology of killing a precious person in your life in order to save yourself and others.but i believe it could have been executed way better than that I don't recommend this film."
47,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,21 November 2017,disturbing parable,"The movies of Yorgos Lanthimos are hard to compare or include in a category. Maybe they should be declared a genre of their own. Dogtooth or The Lobster provided dystopian perspectives of family and love. With 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' it looks that he made steps ahead. Both in assimilating and processing myths and social relations, but also in creating a disturbing atmosphere. This is a disturbing film from many points of view. Because or despite of it it forwards a strong message that makes the film impossible to forget.The story starts as a medical drama. The successful surgeon dr. Murphy (Colin Farrell) has it all - a beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman), two manageable kids, and some kind of a tutoring relation with another teenager of lower social condition which he may lead to becoming a surgeon as well. Yet, the apparent solid fabric of his life is slowly deteriorating as the kid friend starts showing signs of becoming somebody different, who shares dark secrets and has reasons to punish or even destroy his life. The film slowly slides into horror, fantastic, myth. It ends in a very different place from the one it started. It's shocking and frightening.The art of Yorgos Lanthimos combines the fluent story telling with the mastering of the different genres, but his roots are deeper, as the hints to Greek mythology that is included in the title. He also makes no effort to avoid controversy of break taboos. It's not easy viewing, but it's impossible to get out of the mind if you immersed in his world. Strongly recommended."
48,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,17 November 2017,"Nice Attempt, But Ultimately Fails","Yorgos Lanthimos goes for a distinct style that ultimately fails. One might perceive it as dark comedy, though the humor in it is more that what is being said is being said at all. We're not laughing with the movie; we're laughing at it. Characters will have asides either with their dialogue or with their actions where they do or say something so outrageous that you can't help but to laugh. Colin Farrell's talk to his son about an incident involving his father certainly comes to mind. These moments serve no purpose; they do not further the story. They don't really add to our understanding of the characters. All it is is fluff. It's extra baggage that, for whatever reason, Lanthimos thought would be necessary or funny, and it's not at all. The film is littered with these asides, and all it did was dilute a rather interesting story. Buried under all of this extra sh*t is a story that could have made for a fascinating and riveting thriller. But instead, all we have is an interesting concept wasted by a writer who doesn't know how to stick to the basics of screen writing. It's amazing that I'm saying this about an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, but I don't know how else to put it. Every line of dialogue, every single character, and every scene of a movie should be solely in service to pushing the story forward, and this movie is filled with dialogue, characters, and scenes that only stagnate and offer nothing to the overall narrative..."
49,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,29 December 2017,Terrible,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Completely stupid and bizarre. Do not waste your time. I usually can see the good in any movie, but not this one."
50,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,10 November 2017,Too weird. And loud.,"This got a rave review in my daily paper. It's not getting one from me. Weirdness hits a new high.Surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) recently lost a patient on the operating table. He's taken young Martin (Barry Keoghan), the patient's seriously weird son, under his wing. Martin is dating Steven's cute daughter Kim (Raphey Cassidy). Her young brother suddenly loses the use of his legs. Then Kim does too. Steven and his wife (Nicole Kidman) are at their wits end. WTF is going on?You may well ask. To underscore the strangeness of the story, the movie is mostly scored to a cacophonous barrage of pure noise, painful to the ears. Colin Farrell, bearded and beefed up from the super-hunk we are accustomed to, plays with deadly seriousness this man whose world is coming apart  reminiscent of Regan's mother in THE EXORCIST. Kidman, whose role is more akin to Mia Farrow's in ROSEMARY'S BABY, often looks as if she is as flummoxed by this script as we are. The theme is Revenge (that dish best eaten cold).Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos gave us THE LOBSTER two years ago. Here, as there, there's a glossy sheen over the production which  with the weirdness  reminded me of an Almodovar movie. Perhaps it was just the soundtrack, but I left the cinema feeling slightly sick."
51,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,28 October 2017,Boring and complete garbage,This was without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. Hollywood has nothing to offer. I'm not going to bore you with a long review because there's nothing to review. This movie was vomit. One should burn their money before going to see this pile of crap! Nicole Kidman needs a facelift for her facelift.
52,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,1 January 2018,Utter tripe,I have never written a review before but this film was beyond anything I've seen before. I wish I had read the reviews before embarking on this absolute shit storm of over 2 hours of my life wasted. Accomplished actors being made to look foolish. I know we're hardly in it but I honk I can honestly say this is the worst film I'll see in 2018!! Utter garbage.
53,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,22 December 2017,What is the 4 star review on this junk?,"Im convinced these review sites are rigged. When you first google this movie all 4 + stars on reviews but if you have actually seen this movie or looking for an honest review this movie should be rated zero and never to be shown in theaters. This movie is hideous. It is disturbingly depressing, cold, morbid beyond belief, weird - IONLY watched this because it was advertised as a thriller but it is not a thriller at all. It is just one of those weird dark, twisted, perverted dramas. Some on here are listing as dark comedy>? This is the farthest thing from a comedy - just because a few warped souls laugh at menustration or jerking off your husbands work partner as laughable..that just makes this movie more for the trash it came from. So sick of these perverted hollywood freaks thinking ""art"" is us having to watch them get off on writing sexual distrubing scenes of discusting men always making everything about sex. Now we have to believe menustration and hairy arm pits are one else of their perversions. Kissing feat,,,jerking off in a car? yeah, ..real entertainment.If hollywood keeps this up Ill have no issues never buying movies again. This isnt worth it. Where have all the great movie writers gone and actors who dont sell out to dark perverts just to make a movie."
54,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,15 December 2017,WORSTTT MOVIEEE EVERRR,"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WORST MOVIE EVER:!!!!
PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME BY WATCHING SUCH A BORING MOVIE...."
55,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,12 December 2017,No. Just No.,"What is this? If there's anything to gain from this so-called ""film"" it is the utter feeling of deadness many in society feel because of an absolute avoidance of God--and we really don't need a movie to help us with that. The only thing Irish about this film is some of the accents. I'm disgusted with this schlock. Now I'll see if I can erase the memory of watching Colin Farrell masturbate. Ugh!"
56,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,24 December 2017,Enough with the rubbish.-,"Over the last few years Lanthimos is considered to be as an upcoming director and there is something really stinky about this story. Every film he makes is more disgusting and meaningless than his previous one. There's obviously something wrong in this guy's head. However, this is not the worst thing about him. The real problem is that all this trash that his sick mind is producing is being advertised as another masterpiece and displayed in front of our eyes. Someone should inform him about the fact that the unlimited and unnecessary perversion is not considered as a work of art. Also he should know that one can simply not adapt an ancient myth into a modern real story and combine both fiction and non-fiction in the same film. Of course inside a sick head anything can happen. After all who am I to criticize Lanthimos' work? My average mind is too humble to understand the quality of his creations...
In any case I hope that the underage actors of this film will not have any mental disorders in the future. As about me in order to protect myself from any possible trouble of such nature I will never again put myself into the useless procedure of watching his films. I have done that mistake three times already and this is more than enough for a life time. No more perverted families and masturbation in cars for me. To the intellectuals who enjoy watching supposedly high art of this kind I wish them good luck."
57,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,23 December 2017,Comedy movie,One of the worst movies I've ever watched. The only way to consider this film logical is to classify it as comedy.
58,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,20 December 2017,2h and 1min stolen from my life,I would call this the worst movie i have ever seen but that would be wrong because this cannot be called a movie. It's a complete and absolute garbage and a waste of time.
59,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,17 December 2017,Don't bother - ancient tragedies don't adapt well into modern movies,Don't waste your time. This is a terrible movie. Greek tragedies don't update well to modern day. Most of them have illogical and stupid and irritating stories that only fit into the context of mythology and ancient times.Colin Farrell plays a doctor who negligently killed a man. Later the son of the dead man puts a curse on the family of the doctor. The kids get paralyzed and stop eating. The only way to stop it for the doctor to sacrifice one of his family members. Nicole Kidman plays the wife. The monotone in which the cast speaks in is silly. The sexual scenes are out of place. The tragedy about this movie is the fact they made it.
60,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,16 December 2017,"But for the stars, who would watch this?","I know this is based on a play, I'm not sure how much they have stuck to the original script, but the whole film to me felt so unreal 
and so unbelievable. I mean, it seemed odd the attention Colin Farrels (a professional person) character was giving the boy, even if he felt 
guilty for his past mistake. Then, when the boy threatens him, and his children are dying, why would he not kill him as opposed to killing 
his own son, even if he thought they would die. Why would he not call the police, why would he even entertain the boy as much as he did, 
I thought his character was so unbelievable, although his acting as always was good, although bizarre. What was it that the boy did to the
children, the only thing I could think was he had somehow brainwashed them or hypnotised them as there was no explanation. How could
you sit at a acfe where the boy who is responsible for your sons death is as well? Not real at all. If but for the main stars who were in this, 
I don't believe it would get the attention it has so far. But for Colin and Nicole, I would have definitely not watched this to the end. 
I think as a film maker, you have to make films that are appealing to an audience, not films that are just self gratifying, unless you are
using your own money to make them. If you are using other peoples money to make your film, then please make something that has a
large audience as there's plenty of good scripts out there that could be made as opposed to stories like this that have multiple plot holes
or unrealistic situations and unlikable characters. Acting was good, cinematography was nice, just the story was awful, my friends kept 
looking at me as if to say WTF is this! You're 2 hours better off spent watching something else!"
61,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,21 November 2017,You need to see this one,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a new psychological movie by Yorgos Lanthimos the man who created Lobster and Dogtooth which were also pretty amazing but this one takes step farther and if you appreciate a good storytelling you will be amazed how good this movie is. Movie follows a surgeon Steven as he befriends Martin, a kid whose father died on his table, and how his life will turn into a living hell. Looking from dramatic perspective of movie it was pretty good seeing movie put all characters together and how they start to connect creating a prefect environment for something chaotic. As movie progressed it just kept on building momentum for that moment that will everything start to blow apart inside pretty good lives of our characters. About half of the movie things start to get down and it just keeps to pull you inside and make you lose your mind over things that are happening just leaving you speechless and in search for answers. You slowly as time passes start to get terrified and sincerely mind blown how things are going and you are coming to the third part of the movie that will completely make you scream and make you not believe what is happening and all that filled with terror and horror. Final scene comes and you just can't believe what you watched and how it all played out. You need to give Yorgos a praise for screenplay and writing that he is done because it is something special that manages to create and it will make you wonder what is there else to put to blow our minds. Colin Farrell (Steven) was absolutely amazing, once again he showed how good dramatic actor he is and that he is capable of some serious tasks. Nicole Kidman (Steven's wife, Anna) was also pretty great in her passion and loving that her character puts throughout movie. Barry Keoghan (Martin) was incredible, in all his coolness and emotional manipulation that he provides in whole movie. There are no words that can describe how unique this movie is and how it will play with your mind if you fully focus your attention to details. You will want to see this movie without any doubt. 3.5/4"
62,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,7 November 2017,"A thing of great beauty, if you have the patience.","Wow.Just wow.Sorry for the repetition.It's not easy to reinvent cinema; but Yorgos Lanthimos is doing just that.He's pulling in Hollywood A listers to put in career defining performances in his movies and hey, with a Greek shrug of his shoulders, he's pulling it off.Agamemnon would cheer; I think.This is a great piece of work. It's art house and it's extremely challenging, but nobody left the screening I was at, despite several flinching moments.I can't review this on a plot basis because it would spoil it entirely.But I will say it's a masterpiece in direction, superb acted by all three main protagonists and darkly hilarious, although not many in the auditorium laughed.And beautiful.Just beautiful."
63,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,19 December 2017,"All copies of this film should be burned in the streets, uniting the world for a noble cause","I'm disgusted that I wasted my night watching this horrible, gangrenous, festering piece of rot. I'm going to flog myself 100 times tonight to punish myself for ever thinking this might even possibly be worth watching. If every copy of this crap were burned in the streets and every trace of it wiped from all forms of digital media and the internet, the world would immediately become a better place. If you gave me the choice to break my own arm in a bench vise or watch this film again, I'd go ahead and break both arms right in half, just to make sure my point was clear. The Lobster was interesting and good, but this ""film"" makes me feel like I'm stuck in a nightmare while locked in a dark closet, being force-fed all manners of the dirtiest Russian street drugs available via a funnel stuck in my rear end. If you think it's worth a watch, just know that you'd be better off spending your evening trying to drive nails with your forehead."
64,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,29 November 2017,Absolutely f-cking brilliant psychological horror film!,"I had a high hope watching a psychological horror film 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' and all I have to say that I was absolutely shocked after watching it. My God! As a big fan of psychological thriller/horror films, this one's completely creepy, disturbing and shocking movie as the story, but I actually loved it. It's f-cking incredible! I also consider it a black comedy because it has many hilariously strange dialogues; ""My mom's attracted to you. She's got a great body."", ""I've just got my first period."", ""Can I have your MP3 when you are dead?"", etc. Excellent atmosphere and cinematography! Smartly directed and written! All great performances! My second favorite film of the year so far after 'mother!'. This was absolutely f-cking brilliant psychological horror film. I'd give it a 10 out of 10."
65,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,6 November 2017,Unsettling,"The Horror genre keeps on taking leaps forward in terms of creativity. The Killing of a Sacred Deer, along with It Comes at Night, are two impeccably original horror films that don't play out at all the way you expect, and that's largely the reason why I love them both so much. I haven't seen Yorgos Lanthimos' other work, but what I have seen, is a good number of David Lynch's work. And The Killing of a Sacred Deer sure feels a whole lot like one of his films. Aesthetically, tonally, and Lanthimos' direction all feel straight out of something David Lynch would make. Interestingly enough, as memorable as this film is with its terrifying plot, everything is often very quiet and soft spoken. It's almost like the characters aren't surprised at the events that unfold and that makes it all the more unsettling when horrifying things start to unravel.Contributing to that horror, is the films main antagonist, Martin, played by Barry Keoghan. He was good in Dunkirk over the summer, but his performance as Martin is just about as close to perfection as you can ask for due to how that character is written. I don't want to say too much about what he does, but it's some of the most unsettling things I have ever seen in a movie, period. It's these psychological thriller/horror films that scare me the most. Much of this film is left in ambiguity and up for interpretation, which is part of the reason why I'm not revealing much of the plot at all as I just don't have the answers. But when a film captures the perfect tone and mood, especially in horror, the events tend to speak for themselves and you don't need things to be explained to get what the director wanted you to feel.Overall, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is an extremely difficult film to watch, but not because of gore or violence, more because of the dire events that drive the plot forward. I don't think I'll ever watch the film a second time, but it sure was worth more than a glance.8.5/10"
66,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,1 January 2018,"I'd have to agree with the negatives, sorry!","Well. I do normally like dark movies, psychological thrillers etc. And I did really want to like this one after everything I heard about it. I expected it to be emotional, sad, evil so many other things. I expected to feel bad, disturbed, hopelessness and so on... I expected to see a tough piece of movie. But I didnt! It never happened. While the cinematography, the screenplay, the acting and so on is very good; The movie as a such isnt. I have honestly gained more from other movie trailers than from this full movie. This is, at least according to me, almost flirting with surrealistic movie genres as it doesnt explain or solve everything. You will end up with more questions after seeing this than you probably had before/in the beginning of the movie. At least I did. And yes, I did end the movie by saying ""what the f****?!"". Sorry, not my cup of tea."
67,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,29 December 2017,Total waste of time,"I really don't know where to begin with this, it's such a BAD movie.
The acting is, well, wierd from the off, like they are reading from a book, literally.
I thought that with the stars in this movie and the ratings it received it would be a sure fire hit in our household. How wrong i was, i really don't know what the other reviewers of this were thinking, to give this a 7 or 8 you must of seen another movie by mistake.
After and hour i thought we should be watching something else but, the wife said ""no"" lets stick with it, it may be good. At the end i asked her what she thought, ""absolute rubbish"".
This isnt a classic in any way, shape, or form, please please please stay away, it is definately 2 hours you won't get back."
68,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,28 December 2017,The Beauty of an Incredibly Strange Film.,"Yorgos Lanthimos is best of his strange kind of films. If you are a fan of such films, you gonna love this one. The strange music will tingle your mind for a long time.Steven is a cardiac surgeon, living with his lovely wife and two kids. A patient dies on his operation table. The doctor makes a bond with the patients son. At the beginning, the doctor gives him expensive gifts and treat him like his son. Even invites him to the family. But, his entry into their life turns things upside down.A really beautiful film. You may tremble every 20-30 minutes. Watch it carefully, and with the whole heart for the best viewing experience. This is one of the films that will remain with you for a long time after watching.Amazing performance of the cast. Expressionless expressions give the film a very uncomfortable feeling, that suits the best for the movie. Nicole Kidman,Colin Farrell, Barry Keoghan, the boy and the girl, and everyone else in the film did amazing job. Kudos to the entire crew.True film lovers, never ever miss this film.
One of the best in 2017.

69,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,25 December 2017,An Abstract Cul-de-sac,"As much as I am a devout dervish of films that refrain from spoon-feeding the viewer simpleton gruel - indeed, of nebulous narratives which obfuscate their motives until the denouement - everything has a critical mass... And this breaking-point was reached in 'The killing of a Sacred Deer', at about the two-third mark of its 2-hour-plus running time -- where the sinking feeling that the film was going nowhere, envelopes and summarily drowns the viewer.The acting in this film, is another aggravation -- compounding in frustration the further it traipses towards its unfulfilling, somewhat predictable finalé. Very stilted exchanges, sometimes bordering on rote reading of lines, and po-faced countenances perambulating through nearly every scene, like apparitions - often in spite of the emotional dynamics being presented - conspire only to irritate, nay entertain the viewer. It is nearly impossible to engage with the characters of a film like this with any other emotional faculty than annoyance and disdain.The cinematography is neither here nor there in 'Sacred Deer': bland settings (mostly cold hospital settings and arguably even more sanitised, upper-middle to middle class suburban domiciles) do not resonate nor set much of a mood beyond the torpor already imbued via the aforementioned, conspiring facets.The 'bizarro world' nature of the canvass presented (very little human activity beyond characters directly related to the immediate ""story""; an almost post-apocalyptic eeriness in the desolate feel of the few environments depicted), where multiple guns shots do not elicit any response whatsoever - constabulary or otherwise--in an upper-middle class suburb--located in the United States of Armipotence(!)--is rather immersion-breaking; if for nothing else, then the lack of an established universe (is this real-world or Twin Peaks?).If one is looking for an abstract piece, I recommend Winding Refn, Von Trier or even Malick (*the latter's earlier works, ideally), than this journey into the WTF of unlikable weirdness."
70,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,24 December 2017,ABSOLUTE RUBBISH,IF THERE WHERE AN OPTION TO PUT 0 STARS I WOULD. WASTED 30 MIN OF MY LIFE WATCHING THIS ABSOLUTE PIECE OF SHITE. KILL THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS EVEN POSSIBLE: RUBBISH.
71,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,21 December 2017,worst movei ive seen in a long time,This movie is like watching a video where you are immediately told that you will have to suffer through watching someone tear the wings off a fly that should have known better than to get caught but didn't
72,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,20 December 2017,worst movie of all times,"I haven't been disappointed and disturbed from a movie that much since decades.
A terribly awful motion picture in every possible way.
1. A 12 or 13 year old girl appearing in her underwear seducing a 15 year old boy? 
2. The epic scene where a father is shooting his son in the chest and everybody in the family seems ok with that so long as the mysterious curse is gone and so long as it's not me who is shot.
3. The father doesn't know whom to chose to kill so he asks the teacher which one is your favorite ? If you have to chose which one you will chose? So the good one at school gets to live and the lesser one dies.
4. The mother is not offering to the father that she gets to be killed to spare her children high is natural but tries to convince him to kill the boy he is the youngest and they can get another easy if not naturally then IVF.
5. Each child and the mother are trying to prove to the father how good they are to be spared, the wife is wearing his favorite dress the boy cuts his hair the girl make sure her dad is not upset from her.
6. The mother is that eager to get the medical record of the boy's father she is offering a sexual experience to her husband colleague just to get the file and get a lead to end her son suffering yet she is totally ok about the father shouting him.
7. Why does the anesthesiologist need to be in a sexual relation with the wife he can just get it to her because he is sympathizing with her, why do the 3 doctors need to appear as shit.
8. It's quiet obvious that the writer of the movie had had a bad experience with doctors and is revenging. 
9. The father doesn't not think of reporting the boy to the police or to a psychiatrist so his surgery in the past will remain a secret and Tom he'll with his son.
10. After the son is killed they are fine dining in a restaurant and the other boy is passing by them absolutely no problem with that.
Nicole Kidman and Colleen Farrell have let us down by dropping their responsibility in the society. 
A feel bad movie by all means , aimless and not worth a minute to lose in front of it not 2 hours , I do regret I saw it. I was mislead by the names of the crew who obviously have started to loose it."
73,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,19 December 2017,Pretentious garbage...,"I cannot overstate how thoroughly disappointing this film is. I have no idea why people like it or what redeeming qualities they see in it.The movie starts with this weird kid, who seems on the autism spectrum, hanging out with this weird doctor.The doctor has weird kids. The doctor also has a weird wife. The boy announces that he holds the doctor responsible for his fathers death and he has to kill a family member to redeem himself - otherwise everyone in the family will die.The doctor seems shocked but doesn't confront the weird kid Martin. Then his son gets sick. Then his daughter. Then the doctor kidnaps Martin and hits him once or twice.The wife lets Martin go. The doctor puts a blindfold on his, arranges hus family around him, and spins and shoots. He kills his son. The family then go to a diner and Martin comes in and has a glass of water.The end.I see people reviewing the film are heavy into thinking they are deep by saying a doctor symbolizes God, Martin is symbolic of mankind, ketchup is symbolic of invisible dark matter that gives weight to our actions , etc.I personally think its just lazy writing and a complete waste of two hours. All the actors are also thoroughly annoying, delivering their lines in a strange monotone. If the movie came to a conclusion that would partially redeem it, but nope. It reminds me of the feeling I had after watching ""Lost"", I realized the writers wanted strange things happening for the sake of being strange but didn't have a story to bring the strangeness together.At least I didn't pay to see it, that would really suck."
74,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,21 October 2017,"Lanthimos' Latest is a Solid, Sordid Cinematic Venture","While I wasn't a huge fan of ""The Lobster"" after viewing it for the first time, it has been a film I gradually came to appreciate and admire for its unique audacity. I was looking forward to Yorgos Lanthimos' new film ever since strong (albeit polarizing) reviews started coming out of Sundance. While not perfect, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a well-made, twisted film that is audacious and often hard to categorize.It's not easy to give away the plot of this film without bordering on revealing spoilers. As a result, all I will say is that it revolves around the life of a surgeon in Cincinnati who befriends a teenage boy that ends up placing a curse on his family--leading to horrific results. The acting in the film is excellent, and Lanthimos' signature blunt and emotionless style of writing is on full display here. While the film's pacing could definitely have been improved (the main plot device is not introduced until halfway through,) Lanthimos still proves that he knows his stuff as a skilled auteur. Dramatic irony forms the backbone of the film's narrative technique, and it is effectiveness within the film's storytelling is utterly brilliant. Many will be surprised at the shocking ending, which is unlike anything else you have seen in a movie lately (even if you've seen ""mother!"") It will further make the film a very polarizing one for audiences. At the showing I attended this morning, I overheard two people say it was the worst movie they have ever seen while walking out. Make no mistake: this movie is definitely NOT for everyone. But for discerning audiences who can appreciate the unique chills that Yorgos Lanthimos can send down your spine through a pitch-black psychological horror/drama, this movie will do the trick--and to them, I recommend this film. It's intriguing and unique to see a film so polarizing and provocative every once in a while, after all. 7/10"
75,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,29 December 2017,Pretentious nonsense,"This movie seems to aim to be some kind of ""higher"" for art, symbolizing stories from Greek mythology. Applying stylized dialogs and cinematic effects to give it an arthouse feel.
Well, in my mind it utterly fails to do so, and unfortunately when not seeing it like a highly stylized form of cinema, you are left with a confusing, irritating, stiff dialoged, inconsistent kind of psychological thriller-horror that complete fails.
If you put aside the ridiculous references to Greek mythology, you are left with a weird mix of The Gift, maybe a bit of Cronenberg's Spider all embedded in a David Lynch like absurd universe. However, in that case it so completely lacks the stylistic quality of those movies, that you are left with nothing but pretentious nonsense.
Only good thing is the acting, in sofar possible with the absolute terribly directed dialogs. Nice to enjoy Collin Farrell in a more serious role, and I almost always like Nicole Kidman.
Summary, if you like stylized display of mythology, go and see an Opera, a Greek play in the theater; if you like weird movies then pick one from David Lynch, but skip this one, unless of course you just like this kind of pretentious stuff."
76,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,21 December 2017,No logic,Engaging screenplay and performance but without any logic..
77,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,20 December 2017,Horrible,"This movie along with ""Mother"" is horrible. If this is the direction film is going too Ill stop watching anything. Id rather stare at a wall for 2 hours then this. It was so depressing, WEIRD which I am not a fan of . It is not a thriller to be weird..weird id just weird. The way they talked to each other I came so close to turning it off as it wasnt real? It was like they were all puppets with no emotion. The house, the hospital, the kids.were all strange..physciotic. Colin Ferrell was horrible..I dont like him with a full beard..LOVED him in the cheesy Vampire flick he did years ago..he is actually quite handsome and sexy but not in this movie..he came across average, plastic middle aged - no personality. The whole movie was depressing and the last scene was as horrid as the entire movie. Made NO SENSE at all the twirling around to see who he could kill first..his own family just b/c some physcotic kid controlled their kids..no police where contacted..no motive other than just crazy weird..I hated this movie - Not entertaining at all. If you like depressing, weird go for it."
78,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,15 December 2017,The killing of a film career,"Ok, firstly do not let curiosity lead you to watch this film lest you might miss something that will enrich your life even by a millimetre.
Yes there are some decent actors here, except for the wooden Colin Farrell. In this movie he plays a surgeon who has a wooden character and Colin actually overacts the woodiness to an almost unbearable monotony, like he is just reading the lines off the page of a script and told to do it badly. He excels at it . This is not a compliment. 
The filmwork and soundtrack is adequate but the plot is preposterous. 
It is disturbing in the kind of way that you might witness someone having a bad accident or open heart surgery, yes you would look for a second, but this film is over two hours long , so if you want to torture yourself mentally or just feel bad in general, then knock yourself out and watch it... My advice would be to knock yourself out literally, it will have the same result but less long term suffering will be incurred."
79,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,15 December 2017,Make for your self a favor and don't watch this movie,"I left the move theater after 20 minutes, it wast the most painful 20 minutes in my life 
bad dialogue, music, story and acting"
80,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,1 January 2018,Deeply Unsettling with a memorable after taste,"Firstly, its refreshing to see a proper film, with proper acting and proper direction that doesn't have Netflix plastered on it.I had high hopes for this film especially with Barry Keoghan playing Martin, but I was left confused at the intention and impact the Director was trying to make. That is not necessarily a bad thing as it is better to feel something than nothing at all.The film showed echoes of Kubrik, Lynch and early Scorcese at times, and ebbed and flowed enough to make you feel unsettled and almost seasick. There were too many themes running throughout and as the viewer it was hard to settle on one to try and make sense of the film, at some points I gave up and decided to enjoy it for its cinematography and beautifully shot scenes, only to be drawn into another theme which served to distract as opposed to settle you into the experience.The score should be like lighting in a movie, you know its there but you shouldn't notice it. This was not the case in this film, as it continuously and deliberately is used as a tool to unsettle the viewer, which became an annoyance more so than anything.I can't say that I enjoyed this film, but I really appreciate this film, and what the director was aiming to achieve."
81,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,1 January 2018,Two hours you'll never get back,"I have never wanted to write a review before. This movie is the single worst movie I have ever seen. This movie has made never want to watch another film again. It wasn't even artistic, the music was horrible and made you want to throw something at your TV just to get it to stop. I usually try and appreciate what someone try's to create. I totally get what they are trying to do and all the hidden Metaphors, it's just dumb and it failed. The acting tried to save the movie but even a naked Nichol Kidman, who should probably regret she ever read this script, tried to save. The writing was horrible and you could say the dumbest things after the scene and the very next words were the words right out of your mouth. A sick bastard wrote this movie script and probably should be put in a mental hospital. This was not art, it's everything that is wrong with society. I mean the director couldn't even get them to act like human beings. Horrible.... just plain horrible. And the fact that this even has a 7.4 rating goes to show that Hollywood is so out of touch with this world. I can't even watch another film for a while. I feel bad for humanity after this movie."
82,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,28 December 2017,Do Not Waste Your Time,"Wow did I have high hopes for this movie at first and BOY, were they shut down.The trailers for this movie were pretty good. It left you guessing as it didn't really tell you much and with a name like, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" who knows what it could be about.I understand that this movie is based on an ancient Greek play but to be quite honest with you, I don't care. Any movie that's ""based"" on something else should at least stand alone as its own entity - at least to the point where it makes SOME sort of sense.I'm not as bothered by the monotone voices as other reviewers seem to be. The characters seemed to become more emotional and lively as the film progressed which I found interesting. What I'm mostly bothered by is the unignorable neglect of plot. I'm all for a metaphorical movie that challenges me to think, even after viewing it. But come on... there is just nothing to go off of in this film.The biggest plot point that drives the entire film is this teenager who curses the main characters loved ones as a revenge ploy. How do I even begin to think about how this teenager has the power to curse people in oddly obscure and specific ways? IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU REFLECT ON THE FILM. They give no indication to how that could even be remotely possible. This movie is utter bulls**t and a complete waste of time.Sure, this movie is directed well and looks beautiful with some decent performances. But that's like throwing icing and sprinkles on a piece of s**t.DO NOT waste your time."
83,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,18 December 2017,What a shame this could have been excellent,"This film depicts the life of upper class people as we like to imagine it, and brilliantly so. The medical doctors couple have it all figured out, speak in complete sentences and are firm and polite. The house is gorgeous, the children are smart and well behaved. The setting of the story as a whole is very well done, believable and with great actors to boot.The score is not so great. At times we have experimental ""music"" that just annoys and does nothing for the mood, but the visuals are exciting to watch, we have interesting camera angles, no shaking and clever zooms and motion.The pace is slow, yet ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is never boring. There is always a plot twist which is explored after, things take their time but rightfully so.Why the relatively detailed review for a 3 star rating? The problem is that the climax is just a huge letdown. The audience can't help themselves but wonder what is going on, guessing on the crime the apparently genius 16 year old villain commits. It is never explained. The makers thought it would be enough to have the bad guy win. It is not enough. In the end everything good about the movie was negated by breaking the suspension of disbelief in a petty way, just ending the movie.Even ""The Leftovers"" explained its phenomenon, and that show did not need to. There the mystery was the premise for character development, here the mystery is a tool to keep the viewer's attention.I'd like to give less than 3 stars, because of how cheated I feel and because of the waste of talent and production value. But I'm sure there are people who love this and people who will learn from this."
84,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,17 December 2017,The Killing of a Sacred Hour,"Scared Deer Goes Wrong when the Main Character, Like the Director, Can't Decide How to End it. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is from the director of ""The Lobster."" Like ""The Lobster"", the film had a promising premise that failed in the end. Perhaps director and writer Yorgos Lanthimos needs to bring in some other writers and directors to give him a reality check on his next film ending. And he isn't the first auteur who needed help. Lynch and Trier come to mind with some of their incomprehensible films. I don't mind the incomprehensible, it's stupidity I can't abide. The film is too drawn out and too predictable for all its length. Once the main premise was revealed, there were few surprises left in the film. What was a surprise was just how predictable the ending was. There were several ways the film could have gone that would have been more interesting, compelling and surprising. However, the film chose the easy ending by not deciding and leaving the ending to chance. Literally. The motivations of the father in the film, surgeon Steven Murphy, played dully by Colin Farrell, were unclear. Moreover, his ability to make simple decisions had been long damaged by an apparent, unproven mistake, made in his past. And it is that mistake, one that is pivotal to the plot, that moves the story. If you are going to use an event as a driver of action, it better make sense within the narrative. And it better be clearly true. We needed more detail on that event, but why make it easy for your audience to understand your film?Steven is haunted by Martin, the teenage son of a former patient. It makes no sense that Steven would keep him around and allow Martin to harass him. The script lacks the clues to Steven's motivations, perhaps empathy, perhaps guilt, and even if it did, I don't think Farrell could have pulled it off. The film plays like an episode of Black Mirror, minus a focus on technology that is a hallmark of the television series. The problem was that it wasn't as good as a Black Mirror episode and it was much more predicable. That's too bad, because the first act of 'Sacred Deer' was compelling. Things happen in 'Sacred Deer' without a reason. There is no underlying motive for too many of the key actions in the story. We are supposed to take it on faith the way the characters act. Only Martin's motivations are clear within the film. 
 
As long as critics tout films that have incomplete scripts full of cracks, characters with unclear motivations and endings that certainly fit with the narrative but offer no surprises, films such as ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" will be touted as great cinema. And we can expect more mediocrity. Certainly, with a slew of mindless block busters on screens, superhero films, robots, Star Wars and horrors film, critics clamor for more art films. But that doesn't mean we have to cheer mediocre ones.Rating: Rent it. 
We shouldn't reward lazy story telling. See 'Lady Bird' again instead or for a laugh you want to avert your eyes from, see 'The Disaster Artist.' If you want a good creep fest, I recommend ""Borgman"", the Japanese film ""Creepy"" or last years ""Split.""Peace,

85,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,9 January 2018,"A very original, unconventional, funny, shocking, uncomfortable and masterfully crafted film. One of the best of 2017 and definitely not for the average movie goer...","On the way to see ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", I didn't think I was going to leave the cinema thinking about it constantly and wanting to see it again immediately. I was wrong. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", from ""The Lobster"" director Yorgos Lanthimos, is not only one of the most mind-boggling films of 2017, it's one of my favourites. It revolves around a cardiothoracic surgeon by the name of Steven Murphy (played by Colin Farrell), who forms a friendship with a young man by the name of Martin (played by ""Dunkirk"" actor Barry Keoghan), and the strange events that follow once Martin gradually becomes more and more strange. That's all I want to say about the plot as I didn't see a single trailer for the film and went in completely blind and I'm really glad I did, because this is definitely a film that should be experienced that way. From the fantastic performances from the whole cast (especially those of Colin Farrell and ""Dunkirk"" actor Barry Keoghan) to the amazing cinematography and unconventional camera work, the at times extremely unsettling music as well as the near-perfect pacing and run time and unpredictability of the plot among other things made ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" a truly special and memorable experience at the cinema. This is definitely not your typical hollywood film, it is, while frequently funny, also extremely dark and it doesn't surprise me at all that it's labelled as a psychological horror film on Wikipedia. Not only does it have several scenes that will either make you chuckle or gasp, there are a couple parts in the film that are just plain uncomfortable to watch as well, especially when I was reminded of such other films as ""Funny Games"", ""Psycho"" or even Lanthimos's previous directorial effort, ""The Lobster"", another film that doesn't feel like it's really set in reality. It's probably the darkest comedy of the year, but Lanthimos doesn't just focus on one single genre, he instead uses elements of multiple genres like he did in ""The Lobster"", which is extremely refreshing and makes him a filmmaker to look out for. I was strangely fascinated by the overall odd nature of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" and was hooked right from the start. This is also definitely a film that will most likely puzzle most viewers, it pretty much explains almost nothing and leaves you connect the dots after you've seen it and the film has such a lasting impact that you will probably want to read about it in depth and I love the fact that some films nowadays still have that ability to stay with you like that and those are the ones I love watching. It's not even about the basic premise of the film, it's just the way that it goes about telling its story with all it's themes, dark humor, camera work, the weird dialogue and the way the actors deliver their lines to name a few things that really make ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" stand out from the rest of the films that tackle similar subjects. Overall, I was truly impressed by this film, for everyone that's interested in seeing it, I can only recommend it, it's an extremely unconventional film and one that will stay with you even after the credits are over."
86,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,5 January 2018,"Don't know where we are going, but like the ride!","I really like this film. The casting was perfect. I felt a lot like I did after watching The Lobster. Definite tension throughout, but the film had me with the style of delivering dialogue right from the beginning(the conversation about the watches). I read the IMDB description which introduces Colin's character as charismatic? What? I assumed as we were watching that he was a personality-less 'aspie'. Lol I have to admit that I went into the film cold, knew nothing about its connection to mythology/greek tragedies, and found the meaning afterward by reading reviews from others. Even without having an idea of what was going on, I still enjoyed it. I will enjoy it again some time now that I am informed. And, spoiler alert, my interpretation(thanks to the help from smarter reviewers) is that this is a battle of gods. Martin, a god, is punishing Dr. Murphy, a lesser god, for his indiscretion, or for his guiltless reaction to it. Dr. Murphy has messed with the wrong god. Martin demonstrates his godly ability through his inflicting of a plague on the family, and even his ability to cure them, as desired, by him alone. Dr Murphy demonstrates his power by routinely healing the sick, miraculous surgical expertise, and providing extreme comfort/wealth for family, providing an idyllic existence. Dr. Murphy also demonstrates a sense that he has limits, that he is impotent, no match for Martin. His wife confirms that she is aware of this. Nicole was a perfect cast, playing a character not unlike hers in 'eyes wide shut', where she seems to have one face she shares all of the time, but when forced, reveals that she is someone different inside. You sense that she tolerates a less than passionate life in exchange for the predictability and comfort/wealth, and when this is threatened, she is not shy to reveal her inner thoughts, and her teeth. Nicole is a statuesque beauty who plays a peaceful goddess who has no ability to counter the powers of Martin. One thing I haven't figured out is if they are gods living among mortals or if they are in a community and all around them, their friends and neighbors, are also gods? One option that is off the table for Murphy's wife, but open to him, is the idea of killing Martin. You sense that she, both the goddess, and the wife, is more powerful than her husband, and I believe it is safe to say this mirrors our mortal, real world, relationships."
87,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,4 January 2018,Extremely Awkward,"I'm laughing practically every 5 seconds because every line is absurdly awkward. It's like their goal is to make the most awkward movie of all time.Worth watching for the absurdity of it, if it doesn't annoy you too much."
88,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,4 January 2018,"It's not ""weird"" just to be weird, It's trying to SHOW us something discomforting, that conventional movies can't.","While The Killing Of a Sacred Deer will be dismissed by the mainstream, for it's very unconventional acting, pacing, and plot, for other's it offers a discomforting conversation on the dark reality of nature and justice. You aren't supposed to ENJOY it, you are supposed to appreciate it.The intentionally cold and flat reactions from it's characters will turn many off, but give insight into empathy and trust. The subtraction and skewing of emotion allows us to get a closer look at ourselves and our expectations for coping with threats and loss. It's maddening and incredibly uncomfortable to watch, but that is it's aim and success. You have to stop wanting the movie to be what you want it to be, and start wondering why it is the way it is, if you want to take something away from it.While the movie doesn't meet it's impact potential by missing some opportunities for heavier moments and more character development, it is still fascinating, challenging, and rewarding for an open mind.For people that appreciate brain teasers like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Mulholland Drive, Borgman, Under The Skin, and Sleeping Beauty."
89,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,20 December 2017,Cheers Lanthimos !,"Imagine a director which is mostly welcome and largely appreciated because of humiliating human beings. The biggest idea of him is : ""There is nothing to do about it, just accept it."" Lanthimos must make his mind about one point : If you think we are all pieces of merde, and we pay for your idea, this means you are eating merde everyday? And I know what you are trying to do Lanthimos! There are some people can be considered easily to be a genius, but some people like you... They are just like a virus, dead without using living things or living people.Well, I paid your drink once, not again!"
90,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,19 December 2017,Discraful reference to ancient tragedy,"Cheap imitation of Theo Angelopoulos' mindset while using attempting to intrigue the audience with sounds effects and sex references.Overrated movie with no clear purpose or meaning, If there is any kind of symbolism it is as unclear as the reference to the ancient greek drama."
91,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,19 December 2017,What slow acting film,"It's like watching a slow acting porno with out the squeaking in And was very strange to watch if I didn't have my phone I would of gone bad, it was that boring and crap acting if your into this kind of film, please give it a watch if this your kind of film"
92,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,15 December 2017,Mostly unnecessary,A weird family being attached by a weirder person in the name of misguided revenge. The only mystery is the choice of weapon. That weapon earned the star.
93,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,15 December 2017,"Terrible script - boring, pointless and Yorgos needs to see a shrink for his problems not Make movies.",I wish there was a ZERO for this film. Yorgos might have great talent as a director but he sucks at writing. This was by far the most boring film and pointless story ever created. Okay we can buy into the notion that the doctor killed his father.. but this dark film is like a zombie trying to imitate a film by Stanley Kubrick. Sorry for the critics that think this is fantastic writing but it simply does not work. The lobster was decent yet this is almost unwatchable especially with such talented actors. Kudos to the crew for agreeing to this nonsense but at some point the Producers will pull the plug on this Greek piece of crap .... it was like watching paint dry on a wall.. only to see the obvious. Yorgos should return to Greece and consider seeking help from a shrink for his mental issues of thinking this is a worthwhile story to present. Maybe he can do a remake of the Tenant...but throw himself off of the building as a finale. What has happened to Hollywood that they allow this type of garbage. 1 star for the actors who surely had to endure this torture.
94,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,14 December 2017,"Stale and strange, with nothing else to it.","This movie is trying to make you feel 'scared' by throwing a couple odd scenes at you - mentioning periods and body hair, having all characters talk funny with random creepy tunes playing in the background, along with a very stupid plot ~ the decisions the main characters make make no sense and everything plays along to a predictable end.Don't waste your time on this movie, I gave the IMDB score too much weight, it's a 3 at most, no idea who can like this."
95,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,14 December 2017,waste of time,"Pretentious movie that tries to hide the lack of any drama, script or play under awkward narration and pointless scenes.
Total waste of time.
The only good thing is the Bach choral music used in a soundtrack.
The rest is bad, scary bad."
96,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,18 November 2017,Weird but fascinating -- and brilliantly acted,"It's sick and unreliable. It's not in any way a nice view. After one hour or so, it makes you wish it will soon end. It doesn't. In fact it goes on and on, getting worse and worse - and it's fascinating and brilliantly acted by Keoghan, Kidman and Farrell.Yorgos is quite a sick man and I'm not sure what he wants to do. However, 5 days after watching it, it's still growing on me and several scenes will haunt me for a long time. I'm not sure it's all good, but it does something with me. It leaves marks. Also, it holds the most authentic portrayal of medical care and hospital environments I've ever seen in a film.Letterboxd: Mårten Larsson (Morten_5)."
97,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,15 October 2017,Iphigenia in the 21st century,"Not one single deer gets killed in this film, let alone a sacred one. But by choosing this title Yorgos Lanthimos lets us know where he got the inspiration for this film: in Iphigenia, a character from the Greek mythology. After having seen the film, I took one of my old books from high school (1978!) to find out what this myth is about exactly.Iphigenia's father, King Agamemnon, is ordered by the goddess Artemis to kill his daughter, in order to atone for his killing of a sacred deer. When she hears what is going to happen, Iphigenia agrees to being killed, because this would be beneficial to the Greeks.In Lanthimos' version, Artemis takes the shape of a creepy teenager, who terrorizes a successful heart surgeon he considers responsible for his fathers's death in the operating theatre. The surgeon and his wife (Colin Farell and Nicole Kidman) have to witness both their children getting paralyzed. This, announces the teenager, is the first stage of a slow and painful death that can only be stopped when the surgeon kills a family member.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a horror thriller, not so much different from other movies in this genre. The otherwordliness that made his earlier movies 'The Lobster' and 'Dogtooth' so special, is less prominent is this film. There are still some familiar features, such as the strange, deadpan way of talking by many characters. But the surgeon clearly has emotions and is increasingly desperate when he realizes that medical knowledge is useless in this case.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a decent thriller, with a nice weird edge. But the typical Yorgos Lanthimos-style is less prominent, which was a disappointment to me."
98,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,26 October 2017,pick a kid,"Greetings again from the darkness. When we become a spouse and a parent, we immediately develop a mode of protection never before experienced. We would do anything possible to protect our kids and spouse  even die for them if necessary. One of the most gifted and imaginative filmmakers working today forces us to consider a terrifying scenario: what if we had to select one of our family members to die?Yorgos Lanthimos delivered the most bizarre and interesting film of 2016 with THE LOBSTER. This time out he re-teams with co-writer Efthymis Filippou, although this story eschews the dark humor of their previous film, opting instead for a type of gut-wrenching psychological warfare we have not previously witnessed on screen. The goal here is not to make the viewer uncomfortable. Mr. Lanthimos wants us downright miserable from the tension. This is obvious from the opening scene as Schubert accompanies a close-up look at open- heart surgery, and continues through the awkward conversations and speech patterns as we get to know the characters. A terrific Collin Farrell plays the surgeon Dr Steven Murphy. Nicole Kidman is his wife (also a doctor), and their kids Kim and Bob are played by Raffey Cassidy (TOMORROWLAND) and Sunny Sulgic, respectively. The wild card is Barry Keoghan (DUNKIRK) who plays Martin, the most charming and oddball stalker who is hell bent on revenge and retribution. Keoghan is quite brilliant in this most difficult role.Beyond the psycho-revenge plot lies a story of survival and atonement, making for an excruciatingly unsettling time in the theatre. We feel the vice tightening on us as the tone shifts from uncertain awkwardness to dark sinister intentions. Director Lanthimos and his regular cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis are in perfect sync with the various harsh angles (high and low spiked with screeching violins) and the necessary tight shots to emphasize the uneasiness and confusion of the characters.Alicia Silverstone is quite memorable in her one scene as Martin's mother. Frustrated that her flirtations with Steven aren't reciprocated, she belts out the year's greatest line of dialogue: ""I won't let you leave until you've tried my tart!"" Of course, we couldn't expect sexual relations to be any closer to normal than the conversations, and Ms. Farrell and Ms. Kidman ensure this to be so. Truly at the peak of the acting profession, Ms. Kidman has never shied away from tough material or less-than-ideal characters. Her strength and determination come through in every scene here, and it's her scene at Martin's home where she really puts her stamp on the film.As difficult as it is to describe the film without giving anything away, one thing is certain  it's a horror film. It's difficult to imagine a more frightening scenario than what shakes out here with touches of both SOPHIE'S CHOICE and THE DEER HUNTER, while also having nothing in common with those films. The film's title comes courtesy of Euripides, and its suspenseful awkwardness at a level rarely seen. The next feature from Mr. Lanthimos (starring Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz) is due next year, and if the line was forming now, I'd be in it."
99,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,11 November 2017,A Mediocre Greek Tragedy,"Yorgos Lanthimos is one of those directors' people either love or hate, with most of his films being ever so subjective. They're always very out there and sometimes very hard to follow or take seriously because of how bizarre they are. However, if there is one thing Lanthimos knows how to do, it's how to make the audience feel tense and uncomfortable during the entire duration of his films. The Killing Of a Sacred Deer is no exception. Lanthimos did a great job of making me feel uneasy from the very first opening shot, and making that feeling last for the full 121 minutes.However, another trait he's known for is his strange characters, and I mean really messed up. It's as if his goal was to make all the characters in the film as unrelatable as possible. This removed any kind of emotional connection I could have had with the characters, which of course ruined a couple of scenes in the film for me. The dialogue though, irritated me during the whole film. It's as if the writers don't understand how people communicate and interact with one another, almost as if the writing team have all got autistic tendencies. Like adults having conversations at dinner parties bringing up their daughters menstrual cycles and fully grown men showing teenagers their armpit hair are just two of many weird exchanges the characters make during the film. All of this however does add to the odd vibe that the director is clearly going for which is a success on his part.However in films (especially in thrillers), I want to be able to connect with the characters, to create a greater impact when something tragic happens to them. I don't want to be shaking my head at the dialogue and choices the characters make. But with the scrip that's all I seemed to be doing. I feel that if this film had the same plot and cinematography but changed its script, I would consider it an 8/10 but the script (for me anyway) holds it back from achieving that by a couple of marks.IN SUMMARY: If you're a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos's other works such as Dogtooth and The Lobster, you'll definitely find loads of enjoyment from this and perhaps even consider it one of the films of the year. For people who have never watched a film of his before and feel curious enough to see it, approach it with caution as it is not your average film and features a lot of artistic choices which will seem strange to people who have no idea who Lanthimos is. Lastly if you don't like any of Lanthimos's other works, I'm afraid this one is not going to win you over."
100,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,30 December 2017,Amazing what some call 'Art'... I call it 'Crap',"Such a waste of time. There was so much hope for this film, and we kept hanging on, waiting for something, anything other than the horrible dragging script and painful ending. I read some other low ratings, and the reviewers stated it much more eloquently than I care to as I have already wasted enough time on this piece of garbage. Do not waste your time. Trust us (4 of us watched - all felt the same) We needed to drink more to get through it.So bad, so rude and an example of what 'society' considers acceptable as art. It makes me sad for the film industry and entertainment in general. This is not entertainment, not even on the same planet as entertainment. It belongs in some black hole and vaporise.Acting was sub-par as well."
101,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,30 December 2017,Guess IMDb works!,"It's really funny to read so many reviews of people who are airing their grievances because they just didn't get it, therefore got angry and aggressive, confident that their lack of comprehension and taste in film will be certainly shared by their fellow IMDb users, to whom they firmly suggest not to ""waste time"" on Lanthimos' latest. Well, guess what, 12,000 IMDb voters (and counting) not only ""wasted"" their time on ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", but then correctly rated it an 8 or more. Turns out IMDb is indeed populated by people who actually understand and appreciate good cinema; they're just not the loudest ones. Who'd have thunk it?"
102,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,29 December 2017,So bad I had to come here to warn you away,"I don't write movie reviews. But I am so resentful that this Director wasted so much time and money taking us on such a pointless odyssey with so little to teach us and with zero entertainment value that I wanted to ensure that more people like me wouldn't be entrapped into giving up an afternoon on this awful, horrifyingly bad film.""Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a poorly-directed movie with wooden performances from the actors, driven by a screenplay designed to make the viewer feel awkward for no other purpose (if there is any purpose to anything in this film) than to hate the characters. I showed this to a room of four people. After 70 minutes or so I noticed everyone was either sleeping, or fully tuned in to their iPads, so we abandoned this pretentious pseudo-art film 2/3 of the way through. I feel that the greater sacrifice than not knowing the ending was having had to endure the storytelling that far through.The actors were CLEARLY deliberately told to ""not act"" or to put forth wooden, emotionless performances, in some sort of attempt to create a tense atmosphere, which they did with varying success. Farrell and Kidman are actually good actors and gave us occasional glimpses of humanity but the vast majority of the dialogue is delivered with all the passion of a United Nations translator. The plot moves incredibly slowly. Unnecessary scenes abound. Long lingering shots and scenes deliver neither a tableau vivant or any sort of message.The deliberate insertion of incredibly awkward sexual scenes and references -- a sophomoric, derivative pseudo-art-film attempt to cause the audience to question our own lives -- merely make us squirm and hate the characters even more. They also feel more like TMI revelations of the screenwriter or director than character or plot development devices.At the abandon point, where our protagonist has confronted his tormentor, there is the possibility that by ending him, he could cause the entire cast to perish as a result. By this point that seemed like a pretty good idea -- a swift ending to a pointless film and a rightful demise of a bunch of characters that, thanks to the director, I had grown to loathe. Having not stuck with it thru to the ending, this is how I prefer to imagine the film concludes, so that there may never be a contemplation of a sequel.This is a terrible movie. An awful movie. I will deliberately avoid this so-called auteur's work (he also gave us ""Lobster"", which I bailed on about 10 minutes in) the future.I feel bad for the DP, the actors, the Producers. I even feel bad for the Best Boy and Craft Services. All clearly worked hard on this film, toiling under the tormented gaze of a deranged director drunk on his own prior (ahem) success. I hope they will not linger on the failure of this particular tome. They would all do well to avoid similar projects in the future."

106,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,26 December 2017,Don't waste your time - It is too slow and shallow story/acting,"I normally don't write reviews but after seeing this movie (with so much expectations given the actors involved) I am compelled to write review on this.The movie basically lacks characters. They are so shallow. The whole Dr family is so superficial and there is no sign of bond among them (At least director does not show that at all). The story is far from being convincing and the whole progression in the movie is so slow that I was tempted to stop watching. I am really surprised that talented actors like Collin Farrell and Nicole Kidman took up the roles in this movie (perhaps they didn't know upfront how bad this movie is).Net-net, save your $."
107,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,16 January 2018,I rate this low budget film lower than others because....,We watch a lot of low budget films and most are pretty good but this one its the lines being said are like they are saying lines there's no reality to it like other low budget films. Its got a weird plot to it too. Its one of the many many low budget films we watch so I can say this basing against other B or low budget movies it could had better acting in it than it did if they did sound so robotic like they were just saying their lines and no real acting behind what they were saying I would of given it a higher rating.
108,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,16 January 2018,Pointless. Just pointless.,"And this is coming from someone who knows what this is supposed to be based on and loves Dogtooth and The Lobster, but chooses not to be a pretentious moron and act like there is some 'brilliance' in this movie that everyone missed. There simply isn't. This is an objectively bad movie. But, for all of you that want to feel superior and included, by all means, go ahead. Keep saying how great and misunderstood this movie is. It's rather funny.For anyone that is not as lame, watch something that's worth it, like Mother, for example. :~)"
109,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,15 January 2018,Stupid,"This was the worst movie ever. The acting was terrible especially for ""top rated actors"".

111,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,14 January 2018,Capsule Review: The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer can be called a gradually numbing experience. What it does with a cliched story and robotic characters is take you by the end of a cliff and create a scenario where it feels like it is constantly pushing you over. Colin Farrell plays a cardiologist and a father of two who develops a friendly relationship with a psychologically unstable boy (Barry Keoghan) who seems like he has a sinister plan. It is too late before Farrell's character and his wife, played by the radiant Nicole Kidman, realize that things are out of their control. Even though Farrell is a personal favorite, I have to say that it is Keoghan who transcends the screen with his nuanced performance that even has me believe that he really has issues. Also seen in Dunkirk (2017) recently, he is definitely an actor I'll be looking forward more of from. The arresting background score is one of the most appropriate and effective things I have seen in a film in a long time. You could also say that director Yorgos Lanthimos takes advantage of scary soundtracks to drive his story ahead which has shades of The Lobster (2016), a film that The Killing of a Sacred Deer has a lot of semblance with. Although the characters spewing robotic dialogues hampers the proceedings, the experience that you get from subtle references to perversion, psychological imbalance, obscure habits of the characters, and the overall progressive plot is one worth relishing. Lanthimos is known for obscure dramas and this is as good as it gets. It's almost a film that is very difficult to explain, but is very easy to comprehend. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is highly metaphorical and best suited for people who love and can understand metaphors. TN."
112,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,13 January 2018,About as jet black as humour can possibly get...,"For a filmmaker as avant garde and layered as Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster), the plot of The Killing of a Sacred Deer is deceptively simple. Alas, I can't give much of it away here other than to say that a surgeon (Colin Farrell) is forced to face up to his past by a teenage boy (Barry Keoghan). Lanthimos has got the best out of Farrell before in the aforementioned film The Lobster and he is excellent again here. Farrell is a much better actor when not asked to do an accent and he simmers and pops here in a difficult role. Indeed, in a Lanthimos film all the roles are difficult. Each character only has two settings, a robotic lack of emotion or over the top melodrama. This style takes a while to warm to but eventually the sheer poignancy of the plot helps one to forget about the quirks and idiosyncrasies.It's about time I devoted a paragraph to Nicole Kidman because she really is an astonishing actress. Despite loving her in everything from Big Little Lies to Dogville, I don't think I have ever truly given her the props she deserves. As good as Farrell and Keoghan are here, Kidman is at least their match. Portraying a multi faceted character with little more than a pointed glance and a word or two is difficult but the Australian actress breezes through a tumultuous and fearless performance. She really is a movie star in every sense of the word.Anyway, back to Lanthimos. Anyone who has seen The Lobster or indeed Dogtooth will know that the Greek director likes to infuse his films with jet black comedy and Sacred Deer is no different. There are genuinely laugh out loud moments within this dark fable which make the viewer uncomfortable but never detract from the story itself. Actually fable isn't quite the right word. Sacred Deer is closer to a fairy tale. A modern day fairy tale of course, but the idea that all actions have a clear consequence is straight from the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson.A lot of people will not like this film, and it isn't because they don't understand it, it is because some people don't go to the cinema to be challenged. There is nothing wrong with that, it is supposed to be entertainment after all, but those that approach The Killing of a Sacred Deer with an open mind will surely be rewarded with one of the most unique viewing experiences of 2017."
113,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,8 January 2018,"Lanthimos and Filippou continue their excellence, though in a bitterer pill","No matter what you think of his films, Yorgos Lanthimos has a way of grabbing you by the nerves. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is his and co-writer Efthymis Filippou's most challenging, sanity-testing effort yet.In previous films ""Dogtooth"" and ""The Lobster,"" Lanthimos created worlds where the traditional rules of society do not apply. That was especially the case in the monogamy dystopia of ""The Lobster."" There's nothing about the wealthy suburban world the Murphy family lives in that seems unusual, other than it being perhaps too immaculate and pristine. This ""normal"" setting makes it tougher to completely buy this film's concept compared to the others, but the filmmaking is still top-notch.Of course, Lanthimos and Filippou throw the Murphys lives into a slow, inevitable chaos. When surgeon and family head Steven (Colin Farrell) takes teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan) under his wing and introduces him to his family - wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) and children Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and Bob (Sunny Suldjic) - he's eventually faced with an impossible choice that tears at the neatly woven fabric of his family's existence.As anyone familiar with this duo's writing would expect, the script contains lots of matter-of-fact exchanges of simplistic, awkward dialogue and it serves as the foundation for the polite and tidy Murphy family. At the same time, Lanthimos' quiet, dutiful pacing is its own form of foreshadow and utter dread. After a bluntly straightforward line of dialogue sets up what's to come, the story then becomes an unraveling as Lanthimos and Filippou expose the Murphys' flaws and make them suffer.Keoghan, however, steals the show away from Farrell and Kidman. The 25-year-old has an uncanny ability to command a scene. The story assigns him a certain power that lacks tangibility, yet his presence alone manifests that power and creates true tension between him and the actors he shares scenes with, especially Farrell. Once the story shows its cards, ""Sacred Deer"" becomes a bit more divisive. Before then, it's rather plain albeit eerie, but then it goes off the rails without going off the rails, i.e. the film is very explicit about where it's going yet you just can't believe it goes there. Consequently, what begins as a suspenseful drama in the way it looks and operates turns into a fable or a Greek tragedy. If Lathnimos and Filippou had bent the rules from the beginning, ""Sacred Deer"" probably would have avoided it dropping a giant gate in the middle of their film requiring all who pass to suspend further disbelief.Consequently, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" pushes us to explore human psychology in ways we couldn't dare to imagine, and it wields a certain honest if not cynical and cold humor. Yet even when this script most calls for wild, fervent drama and emotion, Lanthimos and Filippou continue along at their preferred methodical, calculated pace. Their reasoning perhaps defies reason and it will drive some emotionally inclined viewers mad, but to their credit, they continue to push. So while ""Sacred Deer"" is a tougher film to swallow, the rigor and thought process behind Lanthimos' films continues to function at a high level.~Steven CThanks for reading!

114,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,7 January 2018,THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEAR*: An evolutionary approach.,"I really don't know, if directors study some techniques to either involve, engage us emotionally in the events or detach us emotionally from the events so they can pose their questions clearly, throw them in our faces. May be, they do not intend to do that deliberately, and it is up to viewers!
However, this movie, can stir your mind up, mess it up, fill it up with embezzlement (it is actually a minefield of moral conundrums), without ever get involved emotionally.
This movie is a reincarnation of an old, perpetual, eternal problem; Justice. 
In evolutionary psychology, justice is discussed in terms of reciprocal altruism(cooperation) and retaliation1 (Eye for an Eye) or (Tit for Tat).
 
Justice through the eyes of gods: 
You might think that there is a resemblance between this movie's theme ""seeking for justice"" and the theme of the Iliad and the Odyssey, but I see that there is a big difference here. At first, there is a big difference between the Iliad and the Odyssey2. In the Iliad, the gods are somehow neutral, but in the Odyssey, they are more prejudiced to Odysseus's cause. Justice was very blind in the Iliad. Blind retaliation to the violation or disobedience to the moral or sacred rules, was guaranteed once you break the rules. No matter who you are, you just win your punishment ticket, once you breach the rules; you incurred your deserved punishment.
 It seems like, the moral codes were Gods-made, but they were autonomic, characterized by ""Apply to all"". In the Odyssey, Zeus and Athene were obviously rooting for Odysseus's cause by all means, through his journey, from the beginning (Released by the intercession of his patroness Athene) till the end (slaughter of the Suitors) 3. In our movie, Gods don't play any apparent role, maybe they were just viewers like us, although I prefer to see them latent behind the stage. They may just responded to Martin's craving for revenge, by putting his plan into action. They granted martin god-like abilities to reinforce his cause: when he called Kim, while she was laying paralyzed at the hospital, she fell down once he hanged up, before she was able to reach the bed. But, even if we are talking about gods reinforcing justice, there was not a single hint to how martin managed to work his plan through, The Murphys didn't stop to ask. It seemed like Martin was himself the god of retribution.

115,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,7 December 2017,"Good acting, weak scenario","The acting was the best part of the movie. All the actors were playing incredibly, especially the young ones. They have adopted the style of Lanthimos' acting but they have evolved it and make it seem more normal. The scenario was not as strong as it was expected comparatively to his other movies and it was not eventually so relevant to the title. We are used to allegorical movies that you have to think again in order to find the purpose of it. That was a thing that I missed from this movie."
116,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,26 December 2017,awful,"Do yourself a favor and dont watch this.
Shocking without making any sense.
I have no idea how it got 7.5/10"
117,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,25 December 2017,Were the actors forced to act terrible?,"I could already sense it after the very first scene in the hospital. There's something very off with the atmosphere in this movie. The actors don't show any emotions and they speak their boring lines like robots. I think even Stephen Hawking's robotic voice has more tonality then these actors do. More surprisingly, actors well known for their oustanding acting performances (especially Nicole Kidman) are completely out of touch with the events happening in this movie. Therefore it was impossible for me to relate to the characters and there was no character development. A lot of pointless and weird scenes don't have anything to do with the plot and are just there for the sake of lengthening the movie. What was the purpose of Martin's sexual relationship with Kim? Why is it normal to share with colleagues that you're daughter had her first period? Why is body hair important to show to others? Why is Anna pretending to be a sex doll for her husband? Does Martin have superpowers? Why is Martin trying to let Steven have sex with his mother? Why doesn't Anna care at all that her husband is flirting with Martin's mom (which was a pointless lie of Martin in the first place and didn't add anything to the movie at all)? 
Another frustrating aspect was the use of irritating and misplaced music to add drama. What kept me going through this movie was the somewhat interesting plot. But in the end I felt unsatisfied."
118,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,19 December 2017,Killing...,"Stylistically this movie may appeal to some, however, I was greatly underwhelmed. These are my main reasons:
-Acting felt really forced and unnatural to me, which stood in the way of connecting with any of the characters.
-The frigid atmosphere added to the sense of distance put between the viewer and, well, anything actually.
-The script was also weird and story got out of hand quickly, without feeling anywhere believable.
-The sound effects and 'music' inappropriately created a false sense of tension. The makers especially went wild with the SFX, which to me were at times excruciating.
If there were any hint of absurdity or a supernatural phenomenon I'd have a reason to accept a lot more of the characters' actions which now just didn't make much sense!
I like weird movies, but this one just seemed to want to be different for all the wrong reasons and in all the wrong ways. I didn't run out of the (nearly empty) cinema, just because I thought some kind of reasonable explanation would come. A reason to make me accept the previously named flaws as a style and a skillful way to make sense of the whole, but alas... No such luck!"
119,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,19 December 2017,I loved this,"Yorgos Lanthimos is a really interesting director. Previous films include the very unorthodox Dogtooth & Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer is very much in the same mould but for me this is his best work to date.
This is a psychological thriller about a surgeon who is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice when a teenage boy from his past gives him an ultimatum. His life starts to fall apart when he realises he must pay for his past mistakes.
When you start to watch this the first thing that hits you is the dialogue and the way the actors perform it. It's very monotone , robotic , almost emotionless . This is a group of people that acts unlike any other and it's mesmerising to watch. The acting is great. Colin Farrell , Barry Keoghan and Raffey Cassidy are superb and Keoghan takes creepy to a new level . 
This is based on a Greek mythology story about retribution and reminds me a lot of Michael Haneke's Funny Games. It's one of those films that sticks in your brain for a long while after watching it . It leaves you with lot's of questions ( in a good way) and the answers are pretty obvious when you sit and think about it.Highly Recommended."
120,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,19 December 2017,Settle in for an uneasy journey.,"Liked many aspects of this meandering but gripping story. Impeccable acting and storytelling, camera work and sound made this extremely worth while."
121,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,17 December 2017,"I'm never watching a trailer, ever again...","We have been waiting to watch this for weeks, having seen the trailer. Great cast, we thought it was going to be a fantastic watch. 
Absolute pishhh. The deliberate, wooden, awkward acting was far too 'try hard' to be artsy. Didn't work. The cast did what they were directed to do, but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. I can't even be bothered to write a serious review. Bored to tears. It's not big and it's definitely not clever. Psychological torment, not thriller, not suspenseful, not captivating....pishhh, of the highest order. I gave a 3, just because the actors can quite clearly act... the plot missed the mark by a country mile. 
Even the musical score irritated the hell out of me."
122,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,17 December 2017,Forgettable Movie,"I quite honestly don't know what all the hype is about. I initially decided to get this movie due to the good reviews and good score here on IMDB, but I quickly realized how misleading all of that actually is. First off, let me say that the acting seems very forced. It's literally so bad, I could assume the actors were forced to read off of a teleprompter for the entire film, rather than memorize the lines. If you'd ask me what movie is the most similar to this one, I'd say The Room, and I bet a lot of people would agree with me. This is the most forgettable movie I've seen all year. The plot is something a 4 year old could come up with, while dreaming. This is supposed to be a ""psychological thriller"", but there was nothing psychological, or thrilling about this movie. I'd bet a thousand dollars that some of these reviews are paid for by the producing company, like the one from gissenmann. This is the most dull movie I've ever seen, but he said ""It's beautifully shot, with talented actors, and an enigmatic plot"". ~~ Yeah. I smell a bribe there. 3 out of 10, don't watch this movie, and don't fall for the lies."
123,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,15 December 2017,Hollywood ran out of ideas... and criteria!,"Who gives green light to projects like these?I would love to spoil this movie, but I did not find anything that could be spoiled, since nothing interesting happens.Colin Farrel wears a beard that can almost be smelled, hospital corridors, Nicole Kidman plays dead, naked, more hospital corridors, a young man eating noodles like a monkey, even more hospital corridors, a cameo by Alicia Silverstone, a couple of shots in a restaurant, two children crawling, etc ...Is it too much to ask for a minimally coherent story?"
124,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,15 December 2017,One of the most weird and grimm movie I've seen ever with a really poor and simple story.,"This was so sad, grimm and bad to the core.
I won't lie that movie wasn't intriguing for some portion.
But that's about it.
The movie starts slow and weirdly. So you expect some interesting turns or plot in the movie. But when the movie ends you feel totally disappointed because of the script. There's nothing interesting. Shit climax. You can tell the story of movie in 2 lines. And anyone can write a script like this based on it.
The movie is also so weird. The characters, the way they talk and behave is so unrealistic & weird.
Only beautiful thing about the movie is quite honestly Nicole Kidman.
Apart from that's it's absolutely shit."
125,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,15 December 2017,a Big Nothing Movie.,"This movie lacks everything... from emotion were the actors interpret their lines as if they were 12yo kids reading their lines from a piece of paper, complete lack of facial and body emotion, the music seemed ominous but lacked anything remotely exiting to go with it... It was 2 hours of my life lost... was it a supernatural thriller? sure seemed like it...the only thing stopping me from completely falling asleep was the music that at some points turned so loud as if something was happening..but nope...nothing.. a big nothing movie."
126,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,13 December 2017,Weird dialogue delivery,"The only imprint I got from watching this movie was Colin's strained and robotic delivery of his dialogue. Strange to say the least unless he was directed that way possibly in which case, it is still strange."
127,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,12 December 2017,Strangely watchable,"This film reminded me of It Follows (a simple rule based curse, dry stilted dialogue, sparse senses and structure), Black Mirror, Birth (where you don't know whether to trust a boy offering supernatural explanations) and The Twilight Zone. Its strange, self-consciously dry in a David Lynch way to make conversations and life feel banal from a cold distance. Ultimately, despite any metaphors and symbology that people will surely be desperate to search for, it really could have been told in 30 minutes. I think I'd have prefered it told more efficiently, as part of an interweaving anthology (or an episode of Black Mirror)."
128,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,12 December 2017,didnt work like Lobster did for me.,"I have to admit thre director come with strange movies with weird social interaction . 
 This movie felt like emotionless in general, with lines that don't connect with audience.
 Maybe too intellectual and artsy pretentious writing?
 Still, better then lots of mainstream in it strangeness ."
129,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,2 November 2017,Interesting but tiring,"This is an interesting film, no doubt. It succeeds at building a psychologically oppressing atmosphere. Comparisons with Lanthimos' previous work, The Lobster, are unavoidable. The sense of absurdity, the tempo, the photography, the neurasthenic characters... In fact, a disappointing Farrell seems to be playing exactly the same guy. Personally, I had the same issue with both films. A promising beginning, but, after an hour or so, I just subtracted myself out of the action and started analysing the movie, way too much, more as a critic than as an spectator. And, for me, this is one of the worst things that can happen at the cinema...If you are into this kind of psychological horror, I would rather recommend Miike's Audition (1999). That, for one, if you can stomach it, would capture your attention from the beginning to the end (and even beyond)."
130,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,1 November 2017,"Revenge, Justice, Nicole, and Colin: It has it all.","""It's the only thing I can think of that is close to justice."" Martin (Barry Keoghan)Justice, aka revenge, is just one of the motifs in this black, absurdist comedy called The Killing of the Sacred Deer. A wealthy family of two doctors is invaded by 16 year old Martin with that revenge on his mind. If you keep Euripedes' Iphigenia in Aulis in mind, where Agamemnon deals with Artemis over killing killed her sacred deer and her demand that he sacrifice a daughter, you'll get an idea of the Greek tragic overcast to the decidedly dark humor.This is not a slasher movie with excessive blood and barely observable motives. Although the disturbing close up opening of a heart surgery hints at bloody business to come, minds move the plot, from the aforementioned vengeance to emotionless living where the beautiful home is as clinically sterile as the hospital in which the two children must spend time for psychosomatic or occult reasons.For sure, however, is that the two children are made immobile by the force of Martin's will, in a standoff with emotionally remote surgeon dad, Steven (Colin Farrell), over Martin's obsession with Steven's bungling his father's operation, causing his death.While Martin blackmails Steven with the most heinous condition for deliverance, we are treated to Kubrick-like long shots down antiseptic corridors to distance us from the horror of this doomed family's life. Even their language is stiff and formal, measured out slowly as if in a bad Puritan-colonial drama. Such careless distancing leaves everyone off center, the better to show the class divide, the degradation of the wealthy, and the baseness of the underclass that lies underneath the veneer. All of this is comical when considering the black nature of it, but a feeling that revenge may be necessary is not far beneath the surface. Moreover, payment may be due for a cloistered, affectless life. As usual in a surreal dissection of privileged complacency, the hollow house, an emasculating masturbation motif, and emotional negligence work together to undermine the surface happiness of wealth and power.The theme of an outsider invading a home and changing things is given extra force with an absurd overlay. Maybe absurdists like Samuel Beckett and director Yorgos Lanthimos are better than the realists and we critics in exploring the terror of living."
131,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,30 December 2017,SO STUPID!!!!!!,Had to set up an account just to review this stupid movie!! DO NOT WATCH this!!!!! I stopped 15 minutes in to set up an account just to write this review! You'll be wasting your time...you've been warned!
132,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,27 December 2017,"Worst movie I've seen! Unrealistic, slow/long, boring, unsatisfying!","If I could give it a 0 score, I would! This is the first time I am writing a review, but I'm so pissed wasting 2 hours of my time, that I feel the need to do so!
I can't believe that Nicole Kidman & Colin Farell would accept these roles! Poor and slow plot, completely unrealistic, and the worst, unsatisfying ending!
If anyone gives it a high score, is either because they are sick in the head one way or another, or they are one of those people who want to sound smart. 
It's even more disappointing that there are so many people who gave it a high score!!"
133,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,27 December 2017,A tense Kubrickesque psychological thriller,"This film has a limited audience. If you like intense, hard to watch independent style thrillers or dramas high on psychological intensity such as mother!, The Shining or The machinist this film might appeal to you. If you want guns, blood, car crashes, babes in bikinis and happy endings you will probably hate this film.In my view this film is almost perfect, the filming is very reminiscent of Kubrick's The Shining or even Eyes Wide Shut, the acting is disturbing and stilted, but it's supposed to be, and it's done very well. This film is like the finest Stilton cheese, it's perfect but it's of limited popular appeal."
134,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,13 January 2018,Utterly dull,You can describe complete movie in 3 words: DO NOT WATCH!
135,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,31 October 2017,Stunning and eerie,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Wow. I had high expectations for the film without really knowing much of what it was about. It really didn't disappoint in any way. From the beginning, the film has an eerie, sinister vibe to it that never leaves and that is always haunting over the film, even before certain plot developments are revealed. The film always keeps us at arm's length, where we see what the characters are doing but never trust anything they're doing, anything they're saying, or really, anything happening on screen. As a pure mystery, they don't get better than this. This is an outstanding directorial achievement. The entire cast is to be commended for playing these characters the way they did, but it is absolutely Barry Keoghan who steals the film. A performance truly worthy of the same effect as even performances like Heath Ledger's The Joker. He commands the screen and it's one of the most purely terrifying performances on screen this decade."
136,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,30 October 2017,The Killing of a Sacred Career,"Yorgos Lanthimos is one of my favourite directors, perhaps even my favourite. His surrealist style is bold and undeniably him, as it is both humorously absurd whilst also containing a deep-rooted and complex message. The Lobster would be Lanthimos' first English language film and is arguably his best to date, the debate being whether Dogtooth is better. Now Lanthimos has moved from England to America with his second English language film, The Killing of a Sacred Deer. The film tells the story of Steven, a surgeon who befriends a disturbed teenage boy only to find himself with an impossible ultimatum on his hands. The Killing of the Sacred Deer is very much a Lanthimos film, however, it doesn't reach the heights of Lanthimos' best work, and feels a little too much like an attempt of commercialisation.Don't get me wrong, Lanthimos' niche surreal style is ever-present in The Killing of the Sacred Deer. The script is filled equally with Lanthimos' hilariously direct dialogue and pointless high level of detail in that dialogue. As well as this, Lanthimos' signature surreal visuals glisten through the films stunning cinematography. Cinematographer, Thimios Bakatakis, changes up his style, favouring the fish eye lens, resulting in a fantastic sense of atmosphere and an almost CCTV feel to the film. Additionally, the film's score works beautifully with the visuals in the film, especially with one specific gruesome metaphor. It is by far Lanthimos' best use of sound to date. All of this comes together to create Lanthimos' auteur style to which I've come to expect in his films.This all being said, the Lanthimos stamp isn't as prominent in the Killing of a Sacred Deer. Although there are surreal moments, they are few in comparison to Lanthimos' entire filmography. This is definitely Lanthimos' most accessible film, as the story is very simple and easy to follow, however, this is where the film falters for me, as a fan of Lanthimos' bold approach. The surreal images in the Killing of a Scared Deer are few and far between, and unfortunately, aren't replaced with anything of paralleling interest. This is a real shame as it's the off-kilter visuals that I've come to want, love and expect of Lanthimos' work. I can see many being bored of this film as the entertainment comes from the experimentation. As I've already said, the story is straightforward and the surreal images are few, therefore the film is rather linear and ""normal"" for the most part. I can't help but feel that Lanthimos is attempting to crack America with this film, almost abandoning his style along the way. He is attempting to make his niche style mainstream which is a paradox in itself. I can almost feel Lanthimos' loss of self-confidence, the pressure to make something more conventional and realistic must get to him immensely, but his attempt to become a modern-day David Lynch falls short. Instead, he's shooting himself in the foot Overall, the Killing of a Sacred Deer is disappointing by Lanthimos' standards. As a film it's great, but as a fan of the Greek director, I was let down by the lack of abstract and experimentation. The story is just too simple for Lanthimos and the film just feels to me like a crisis of self. However, if Lanthimos' filmography wasn't already so rich with abstract ideas and experimental images, then I would probably find myself enjoying The Killing of a Sacred Deer a lot more than I did. This is a multiple watch film and I look forward to giving The Killing of a Sacred Deer a better chance."
137,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,14 November 2017,"Strange, Uncomfortable, Haunting, Powerful and Unforgettable!","Wow! This film is madness but strangely beautiful madness at the same time, there is so much to talk about this film. That, I believe, is the point of this film and that is to start a conversation because this film brings up some many questions and answers very few of them. Yorgos Lanthimos, his directing in the film is truly fantastic from start to finish. The film has a great flow to it and the camera is set up in such away that we as the audience are actually there experience this from a far. The film gets your attention as soon as its starts and what a brilliant idea it was to start with an operation, considering that the film follows a doctor and his family. I can't remember a film that has been crafted so well to be so unsettling and uncomfortable, the film brings up topics and themes that would make anyone feel awkward but the acting in the film portrays them as the norm, which is fascinating. The closest thing that I can personally think of is this film is a combination of Prisoners and The Shining, these combined creates an extremely suspenseful and bizarre emotion ride. Fantastic directing overall.We all know by now that Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman are fantastic actors but this film for me shows them playing extremely different characters to what we have come accustom to from both of them. Both are absolutely brilliant from start to finish but are both just very strange, one minute they can be ""normal"" and caring for their kids and doing day to day things, then the next minute there character will act or say something that just doesn't fit right. This is how the film lures the audience in by carefully placing odd things here and there to grow the suspicion and mystery of the entire story. Yes the story is just a mystery and I still think this even after viewing the film, who knows what was really going on, the film brings up more questions than answers. This is great because not everything needs to be explained to its fullest or at all, why certain characters do certain things or why certain plot points happen none of these are ever found out or explained. For me personally that is a positive of the film not a negative.Even though Farrell and Kidman are great in the film there is one stand out that deserves some award nominations and that is Barry Keoghan who plays Martin. His performance is truly bizarre, weird, creepy, strange and uncomfortable. We as the audience are introduce to him without any real backstory, some small details are added throughout the film but not much which leaves to speculation. However it is the fine line that he plays between innocent guy and psycho that is really interesting, that's not to say that his ""normal innocent guy"" act is not weird it still is but you get use to it just assume that its part of him, not everyone is the same. However once he starts to predict the future and future events that will happen in the film that's where this film hits a new level and gets extremely weird and will probably turn some people away, personally I think it added to the film and made strange even more strange, if that is possible. The Last character in the film that deserves a mention is the score of the film, and yes I did put character. The score in this film is a character of the film it is not there all the time however when it does appear it can be truly haunting and build suspense very well. It definitely has that Kubrick style to it that resembles The Shining, is perfectly crafted for this film and is very well done.80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, this film is very good from the directing, acting and the story that is complete bonkers. However its is a difficult film to watch and its quite slow it does feel longer than two hours and its certainly not for everyone, this film is very dark and is not exactly very happy lets put it that way. Saying that if you do see this film than you will not forget it in a long time especially the remarkably bizarre ending, just wow!"
138,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,12 November 2017,"Brutal, off-key, an amazing Keoghan, pointless","Lathimos is one twisted (bleep). I mean that as a compliment, but only sort of; I wonder after this film, about a 16 year old who's father died (presumably) under the watch of a surgeon and now is using his (uh) psychic abilities to tear his family down into sickness and possibly death, if he can find a story to tell that isn't so, so, so... his usual. The first half was so promising, like 'oh, the director of Dogtooth and Lobster doing a Lifetime-y stalker thriller, the Single White Aspergery Teen Boy' story, I'm in.' And then it... Didn't go where I thought and not in any enjoyable way. My instinct is to compare to Kubrick - certainly in visuals that is the direct descendant - but Lathimos makes SK look like a bowl of sunshine and lolly-pops. His movies had humor, as dark as they were. This is closer to the unpleasant vibes from Haneke, but the stilted approach to directing the actors from the other films doesn't carry over so well. You need some kind of context for this to work which those two films had.Eventually as the characters become more desperate and the (psychological) horror amps up, it feels totally divorced from reality coupled with the freezing coldness of the thing. This is unsettling filmmaking, but it needs a point, or at least some kind of portal for us to get into the characters world. As strong performance-wise as Farrell and Kidman and are (the former does have a good continuity with his tone from the Lobster, and especially the truly great performance by the kid who plays Martin, the context for how they talk and act and their decisions and motivations at some key points either don't ring true or come off as WTF for the hell of it (also, minor spoiler, why is Kidman never afflicted by the paralysis and other s**t but the kids are one after another?) I find this filmmaker so compelling, original, affecting and worth seeing anything he does if only because no one else IS his work now, and this has a concept that drew me in, and it's ultimately an ambitious misfire. Sacred Deer is not unlike the problem that Mother! had a couple months back: we know there's a metaphor going on for something, and it may be too obvious. Only that film built up to its insanity, while this is the same uncanny, eerie tone throughout.Also, cool off with the music cues, Yorg."
139,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,5 November 2017,Off-center psychological family drama is not for everyone (and certainly not for anyone in a hurry),"""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017 release; 119 min.) brings the story of Steven and his family. As the movie opens, with a gruesome open heart surgery scene, we get to know Steven, a heart surgeon, and his colleague, an anesthesiologist. Ne Steven meets up with Martin, a 16 yr. old boy whom Steven seems to be mentoring. After that we get to know Steven's family over dinner: his wife Anna, also a doctor, and his kids, 14 yr. old Kim and her younger brother Bob. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to reveal more of the plot would surely spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose previous movies (2015's The Lobtser, 2011's Alps, and 2009's Dogtooth) have established his reputation as a daring, if off-center, movie maker. Here he goes in a seemingly very different direction than any of these previous movies, namely how a 16 yr. old boy manages to exercise a stronghold over Steven's family in ways that are difficult to understand (sorry, can't say more so as not to spoil). This is a psychological family drama unlike anything else you've ever seen. Beware: the movie is slow-paced on purpose and it takes a good 45 min. before we finally start to understand what is about to unfold. There are plenty of outstanding acting performances, including from Colin Farrell (who also starred in The Lobster) and Nicole Kidman (as the ice-cold wife/doctor). It wasn't until the credits rolled that I realized Martin's mother was played by Alicia Silverstone, now in her 40s if you can believe it. But the best performance of all is by Barry Keoghan (playing Martin), whom we saw earlier this summer in Dunkirk. What a talent that guy is! And for us Cincinnatians, the movie, shot entirely in Cincinnati, brings an extra layer of fun to recognize the many local settings (Christ Hospital's Brain and Spine Center, the Hilton's Hall of Mirrors, the Blu Jay in Northside, downtown's Red Fox Grill, etc., etc.).""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" opened this weekend at my local-art house theater here in Cincinnati (on 2 screes, no less), and I Couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. In discussing this after the movie my friends and I felt it probably was due more to the film having been shot in Cincinnati than anything else. Bottom line is this: ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare and not for anyone. I for one happen to enjoy this movie a lot, perhaps because of its weirdness. The best advice I can give is this: if you liked ""The Lobster"", I'd encourage you to check this one out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
140,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,3 November 2017,"Though the drily dark dialogue isn't as at home here as in the director's previous work, this is still a mysterious and off-kilter film that is interesting and engaging.","Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film features much of the same daringly dark and dry dialogue that has essentially become both his and writing partner Efthymis Filippou's signature style but isn't quite as removed from reality as his other work, especially the fantastic 'The Lobster' (2015), and as such is occasionally at odds with the way it is told (especially in the few jarring moments the crooked cadence completely slips away and a more contemporary vernacular comes into play) only to the point where some of the off-kilter ominousness is slightly lost or sometimes seems strangely undercut by the darkly comic moments that here don't quite fit so well considering that they fade away almost entirely in the final act; still, it is perhaps this brazenly bizarre tone that adds to the sense that something is simply not right straight from the operatic off and from the moment the piece hits you with its startlingly gruesome (and 100% real) opening image, you know that you're in for something both strange and sinister - a fact that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone familiar with the director's previous work - that actually transforms itself slowly from a mysterious dark comedy to an even darker yet equally mystifying thriller that doesn't give you any easy answers or leave you with a satisfying conclusion - it's engaging and interesting stuff, though if I had one main complaint it would be that the piece felt long due to the fact that the second half meandered enormously, but even this is thematically and narratively appropriate in hindsight as both the film and its characters do whatever they can to prolong the inevitable. 7/10"
141,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,8 January 2018,What a waste of time,I wish I had read those comments before. WORST FILM EVER !
142,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,6 January 2018,Mediocre and pretentious movie,"I prefer to write positive reviews. So the fact that I am writing these lines means that at some level I was moved by this movie. Thus the 5 star rating. The rest of my review will be negative. I found the movie to be at best an exercise in translating a classic tragedy into a modern setting. This already called for some absurdities. But some, not a ton as the director chose to pile on our backs (he is also one of the screenwriters). As an example, the scene where the main character tells his son how he masturbated his father when he was a boy is gratuitous. If you want to be disturbed there are far better movies. The worst of all was the feeling, particularly in the first half of the movie, that this was a copycat of ""The shinning"". But all Yorgos Lanthimos can boast vis a vis Stanley Kubrick is that he also made a movie with Nicole Kidman. Period."
143,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,4 January 2018,Disaster-waste of time,It's definitely one of the worst movies that has ever been made. It makes me wonder if the director has personal issues .The movie makes no sense whatsoever. No elite can convince me that this movie has any value to it.

145,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,3 January 2018,Such a waste of time...,Story going on as slow as an injured turtle in a hospital that has no patients(?). It is by a mile the worst movie i have seen with a score over 5. And i am trying not to exaggerate.

my review is too short, wont let me submit. lousy film, lousy plot, totally unrealistic."
147,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,3 January 2018,The worst movie I've watched in my entire life,"Don't waste your time watching this movie.
I'm really disapointed with every aspect of this movie."
148,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,3 January 2018,Deus vult,"""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is the most recent work by Greek Oscar-nominated filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, writer and director here. It runs for pretty much exactly 2 hours and features Colin Farrell again, who gets to act next to Oscar winner Nicole Kidman here and Alicia Silverstone is probably the third somewhat famous cast member. Apparently there is a strong connection to Greek mythology in here, but I don't know about that, so I'd rather elaborate on the film in general. This is the story of a family whose order gets destroyed when a teenager enters their lives and starts taking revenge for what the father has done to his father a while ago. Or we should say, he is rather witnessing the drastic events. The longer the film goes, the more you will understand that there won't be a logical or medical solution and explanation be offered to the audience eventually. Traagedy is inevitable and occasional ideas that the husband or wife will take the suicide route to solve the issue quickly disappeared from my mind again. Sure not everything here felt really realistic, but most of it did I guess and it was a tense thriller, a good watch from start to finish that never drags and for a movie with this runtime, it is quite a success I'm sure. Maybe my least favorite moment was the scene in which the daughter wants to sacrifice herself for the well-being of everybody else. But one of my most favorites was her collapsing during singing. I also think that the relationships between children and parents are very special here. It is interesting to see that father-daughter and mother-son have clearly stronger bonds and there is an excessive deal of violence, emotional and physical, involved for the other directions. Lanthimos is not scared to include graphic sexual references here, mostly about handjobs and female periods. The latter and its constant inclusion early on made me wonder if there is something very wrong in the family too before the boy gets in charge. There seems to be a lot going on under the surface I'd say and the sterile, almost robot-like hehavior of the family members feels very bizarre when they are talking in the most calm and reserved manner about all kinds of contents that deserve all kinds of emotions attached to them. All in all, a pretty good film and I can see why it got so much awards attention. I cannot really see the Shining references, but Lanthimos' style is easy to identify (also in terms of all the sounds you here while watching the tragedy on so many occasions) and it's another success for him, quality-wise certainly not worse than The Lobster. I recommend seeing it to everybody who loves psychological family thriller films. The very last scene at the restaurant was pretty telling too. The girl could walk again, the mother could still walk, but the cost for their health was gigantic. Speaking about Kidman's character, I liked how they constantly made us wonder with certain situations if she was about to be paralyzed too and fall to the ground the very next moment. But it is not required to happen for the film and story to succeed. The bait is definitely enough. It's not a truly great film or top5/10best of the year potential and it probably won't end up underseen or underrated, but this should not take away anything from your intention to see it. A definite thumbs-up for me. Don't miss out."
149,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,2 January 2018,Utterly bland and monotonous overrated whim.,"I was really looking forward to seeing this as the critics and reviewers were very positive about it. Although I'm no fan of Lanthimos I decided to go ahead and watch the film anyways - bad mistake. I knew beforehand it wasn't going to be the average psychological thriller flick, and that's exactly what sparked my interest for it. Now that I've seen the movie and thought about it for a while I have to say that I truly regret watching it, It's just not worth the time. The film relies heavily on metaphors and symbolisms that simply do not work for me. The direction and writing is highly questionable since the very first few scenes. The characters and dialogues are so monotonous, bland and emotionless that it becomes a huge distraction since the first few lines of spoken dialogue. It's obviously none of the actors fault as I'm pretty sure the outcome is exactly what Lanthimos wanted, but it is really painful to see such wasted acting talent in this poorly executed whim of a film. Sometimes actors have little to absolutely no creative freedom over their roles, and it certainly seems that this was the case here. The characters had basically no chemistry whatsoever as everything involving their interactions felt forced and dishonest. There are some scenes that are totally unnecessary and feel very out of place as they contribute absolutely nothing in the plot's development. At the end of the second act is when I really stopped caring about the characters and the movie itself. I wish I could say the opposite but even the musical score felt irritating since the very beginning. I guess the only positive things I could say are on the technical aspect - at least the camerawork, editing and cinematographic style are pretty slick. All in all not recommended, very disappointing."
150,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,2 January 2018,"'He should have come out of that surgery alive, but he died.'","Writer (with Efthymis Filippou ) /director Yorgos Lanthimos (Kinetta, Dogtooth, The Lobster) has created another controversial film that is unsettling, slow, accompanied by an unlistenable musical score, disturbing, and over overwrought.
For those who can think along the same plains as Lanthimous the film may satisfy. Summarizing the plot is a challenge - After the untimely death of 16-year-old Martin's (young Irish actor Barry Keoghan) father on the operating table, little by little, a deep and empathetic bond begins to form between him and the respected cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell). At first, expensive gifts and then an invitation for dinner will soon earn the orphaned teenager (Martin lives with his mother Alicia Silverstone) the approval of Dr Steven's perfect family (wife ophthalmologist Anna - Nicole Kidman, daughter Kim -Raffey Cassidy, and son Bob - Sunny Suljic), even though right from the start, a vague, yet unnerving feeling overshadows Martin's honest intent. Martin confronts Steven with a long-forgotten transgression that will shatter the Murphy family's domestic bliss. And then, unexpectedly, the idyllic family is smitten by a fierce and pitiless punishment - lower limb paralysis, anorexia, bleeding eyes - while at the same time, everything will start falling apart as the innocents have to suffer. In the end, as the sins of one burden the entire family, only an unimaginable and unendurable decision that demands a pure sacrifice can purge the soul. But to find catharsis, one must first admit the sin.The bizarre story teeters on magic and mysticism but fails to engage the audience's compassion. The dialogue - even by great actors like Farrell and Kidman - is delivered in a rushed monotone and the screeching background music buries the story. If you have a lot of patience and strong endurance you may make it through to the unsatisfactory end."
151,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,2 January 2018,Trailer lured me in.,"It look promising, but turned out to be mostly annoying.
A lot of scenes and music score is like nails scratching on a blackboard. It makes you squirm and quiver but mostly with discomfort, Maybe that's the directors intention but personally I wacth movies to be ""entertained"" not annoyed.On the positive side.. the boy is kinda creepy and more important Nicole Kidman IS naked!"
152,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,30 December 2017,Brilliantly eerie,"Shocking story that surprises on many levels. Finally, a masterful film that breaks the mold of studio story-telling formula, reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick. Will leave you thinking about this film long after you've watched it."
153,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,27 December 2017,Just Plain Weird,"I watched this based on Yorgos Lanthimo's previous movie, The Lobster, which also starred Colin Farrell. I had that film as one of my best of 2015. Lanthimo's also wrote and directed Dogtooth, which I thought was strange but good. Sacred Deer goes beyond the beyond, as Farrell and his wife, played by Nicole Kidman, are medical doctors with a son and a daughter. Farrell is a heart surgeon who has lost one of his patients during an operation. Barry Keoghan is the son of the dead patient. He holds Farrell personally responsible for his father's death. suddenly, the doc's kids begin to experience some fairly nasty physical ailments. Keoghan's character has transformed into a Carrie White (Stephen King) type of individual. Farrell is given a Sophie's choice type of deal and it all goes down hill rather quickly. This is not a Disney, feel good about life kind of film, and so if you are not in a positive mood to begin with, avoid Sacred Deer at all costs. It might be the last film you see before jumping off of a bridge."
154,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,4,27 December 2017,Worst Psychological Horror/Thriller I've Seen,"How does one review a abomination? I give it 4 stars only because I was hoping to find out the secret of how so that kept me in it but the secret never came. I read many explanations of the film's ending and meaning and it goes from greek mythology stories to lets just anger the audience with a meaningless meaning and bad acting. So nobody really knows what this film is, but we do know what it should of been, never made. Some pretend to know what this film is, but they are lying. Was he Damien? Was he a hypnotist? Was the family all severely mental ill? The weirdness and blackness of each character made me feel like I was Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby. Nothing normal was happening, characters didn't react as they should. It felt alien. Total power was given to a character that had nothing powerful to give. This is just bad filmmaking. This could of been a good film if the director had just stayed within his ability. He tried a Polanski/Kubrick route and it failed miserably."
155,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,25 December 2017,Not easy on the eye,"Quite disturbing morals but exciting executed and extremely well written. An incredibly bleak film with some really good performances and twisted characters. Yorgos Lanthimos is surely one of the most creative directors out there what he already proved with ""The Lobster"".
Colin Farrell is once again his star in this much darker follow up project. I felt his acting was a bit robotic at times but he still delivered a very solid performance. Barry Keoghan had a very similar acting style but it totally fitted his character and he gave the best performance in this film. He embodied everything the film was about and delivered a very scary and unpredictable character. Great job and a good young actor to look out for. Nicole Kidman also was fantastic. A lot of her performance worked through her silent moments, her expressions, her staring. Great job. The kids were okay. Wished there had been more of Alicia Silverstone. The soundtrack was haunting and fitting the very unsettling atmosphere. Its one of the best screenplays of the year, thats for sure. The way it developed into that nightmare at the end was capturing me for the whole time. Also it is rich on metaphors (something like the Martin character also loves to use) and tough moralic questions. Its not a film for everyone but everyone who doesnt see it misses something."
156,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,24 December 2017,If You Can't Dazzle Them With Brilliance...,"...baffle them etc., etc., and it apparently worked, since the critics love this film. I could not take any meaning from it other than pay for your mistakes, karma will get you in the end, what goes around comes around, and any other aphorism you can think of inserted here.I gave it four stars since it kept me watching to see where it would go, and it went far beyond into sheer stupidity, and all I really cared about by that point was if the dog would get accidentally shot.Stupid, useless movie with stupid, useless characters, and I just can't believe I sat through it, so again, four stars for forcing me to watch all the way to the end."
157,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,5,16 December 2017,No point. Will forget in a few days,"I've watched alot of movies. I've watched alot of weird movies, good movies, bad movies. Movies I've loved others would hate and vice versa. This, unfortunately for me does not make a point. Yes, halfway through I understood that it wasn't reality, but a story of a fable and it then turned to fantasy. I understand that and I can enjoy that type of movie (dogville one of my favourites) if the movie makes a point. There is no point to the movie. Nothing to make you think about days, weeks later. It was a simple fable from the Bible set in modern day. After you realise the irrelevance of fact and understand the fable you then turn to ask yourself, what is the director trying to tell us here? What point is he trying to make? What insightful piece of information does he want the world to know, and therefore be labelled as relevant or even genius. There was none. He told a mildly boring fable about an eye for an eye, and it finished the way an eye for an eye story would finish if you wanted to make it as dry and mundane of a finish as you could. That's not good story telling. Give us a point. Let us leave thinking, you know what I like his opinion or thought on the matter. But the director didn't. Brb reading the Bible and getting as uninspired and unenthused as this movie made me feel."
158,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,2 November 2017,The Best from Yorgos!,"Ohhhhh my goodness. First off, we all know Yorgos Lanthimos likes to tell stories of characters struggling within constraints. In ""Alps"", the constraints are imposed by a demanding leader of the company that impersonates the deceased to help the grieving. Strict regimen, strict rules. ""Dogtooth"" revolves around a North Korean-like isolationist state where children have no contact with the outside world and therefore come of age and meaning battling their own families constraints. ""The Lobster"" mocks traditional marriage/relationships as having them be required by law in near future, thus single people are ostracized to the outskirts or morphed into an animal of their choosing. Clearly we see a bit of Haneke nihilism and abandonment of traditional the loving family ideal/trope. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", Lanthimos' best to date in my opinion, revolves around constraints arbitrarily imposed by a creepy mysterious character about midway through the film. Without giving much away, the protagonist has an agonizing internal dialogue set forth due to rules of the game like the ""Saw"" films. Family is pit against each other, and each character uniquely focuses solely on their own survival. The cinematography itself resembles ""The Shining"", and added to the Kubrick similarities are the strong orchestral score that permeates the film from even the ""lighter"" earlier scenes--perhaps foreshadowing----definitely foreshadowing. Bravo Yorgos"

160,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,4 January 2018,"The worst movie of the decade. Oh, my...","The movie is really bad. Just plain bad, there's nothing else I can say about it. It has no rhythm, the characters are badly developed, and any Stephen King novel's premise makes more sense than the script of this ""tale"". The overuse of ultra wide angle lenses and the lines -too theatrical, but not in a good way- were almost enough to make me stop during the first 15 minutes. And I deeply regret not doing so. Damn, I just lost two hours of my life."

It is utter garbage. A ""triller"" with no thrills.. 
A ""mystery"" with no resolution...
What other category was this in? I dont' care...After 30 minutes, I thought it was stupid and the monotonous voices annoying.
After 1 hour, I thought holy crap this must have the awesomest plot twist coming up to make up for this first hour.
After 1:30 hour, I was just holding my breathe that I didn't just waste 1:30
When it faded to black at 2 hours, my jaw literally dropped. W..T..F... Completely STUPID, no plots twist, no explanation of the ""supernatural"".. nothing.. just STUPID.If you happen to read this, PLEASE do yourself a favor and skip this sh**show."
162,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,20 December 2017,"So dark and disturbing that my friend, who I was watching it with, had to leave the theater three different times!","'THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A psychological horror flick directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, and written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou (the duo also performed the same duties on such critically acclaimed indie hits as 'THE LOBSTER' and 'DOGTOOTH'). The story revolves around a doctor who befriends a teenage boy, and then later learns that the boy wants revenge for the death of his father, years earlier, on the doctor's operating table. It's based on the ancient Greek play 'Iphigenia at Aulis', by Euripides. The film stars Colin Farrell, Barry Keoghan, Nicole Kidman, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Alicia Silverstone and Bill Camp. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's now playing in indie theaters. I found the movie to be incredibly creepy and disturbing, but it's also undeniably effective and well made. The story revolves around Steven Murphy (Farrell), a very skilled surgeon, and his wife Anna (Kidman), and their two kids (Cassidy and Suljic). Steven has befriended a young teenage boy, named Martin (Keoghan). Martin's father died ten-years earlier, and Steven was the operating surgeon. It's soon revealed that Martin blames Steven for the death of his father, and he wants revenge. He explains to Steven that he's put a curse on the Murphy family, and Steven's wife and children will die, unless Steven picks one of them to kill first. Steven at first does not believe Martin, but after the symptoms of the illness Martin described begin coming true, the whole family becomes frantic for survival. The movie is so dark and disturbing that my friend, who I was watching it with, had to leave the theater three different times. I'm used to really creepy and horrifying movies like this, but it even got to me a bit. It's definitely not a happy or pleasant movie at all, but it is effective at what it sets out to do. Which is to just make the viewer completely uncomfortable and disturbed the entire time. So I have to give it a good rating just for that. Keoghan's performance in it is also outstanding as well (it's arguably Oscar worthy). I'd definitely recommend the movie to film fans, and especially horror movie lovers, that can handle disturbing subject matter that is."
163,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,20 December 2017,The worst must seen movie in the last 5 years.,"The words I can say and fits this sick movie, sick, disturbing, ugly, supernatural, freak, rugged and insane.
I cant judge anyone in this movie, its really difficult, was it fair for the doctor? for the little boy, for the eccentric martin!? I don't know, but the little kid was the victim and it wasn't the best choice.
the back music in this movie makes me take off the headset some times, be careful it is really disturbing.
If you are a surgery, make sure you do not drink before you mess up with human bodies, or the price will be unexpected.and I don't think that Dr. larry Banks hand was beautiful, its ugly and dirts with sinless souls and blood."
164,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,22 October 2017,"A unique vision perhaps, but dire","Critic pet directors come in all styles and places. One of the biggest current ones is Greek art-house filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos. After garnering a Foreign Film Oscar nomination for his offbeat DOGTOOTH, Lanthimos made an even bigger splash with his first English-language film, THE LOBSTER(another Oscar nod; Screenplay). Now, despite being booed at Cannes, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER is getting mostly positive reviews. What his supporters applaud is his ""originality"" and ""unique vision"". But, when a film like SACRED DEER comes along that is unrelentingly dire, being ""unique"" carries one only so far.As for it's ""originality"", SACRED DEER's plot about the sins of one family member being payed for by the entire family is as old as...well, in this case, 400 B.C. (Iphigenia in Aulis by Euripides)! The picture is finely photographed (in 35mm) by Thimios Bakatkis with some superb compositions. Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell do what they can with the material, as do the three younger co-stars. Some of the music choices are effective on their own (it's a compilation score).All of this makes it all the most disappointing that Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou's screenplay is so relentlessly aimless. The clipped dialogue, bizarre allusions and grotesque behavior may have worked within the context of an off-kilter film such as THE LOBSTER (even there, the movie ran out of ideas long before the finish line), but, in SACRED DEER it becomes a dirge.I understand the pull of seeing something different for critics who see a lot of movies. I value that as well. But, call me a philistine, but, I will take a modestly made movie with competent performances and a cogent script over the ""original"" and ""unique vision"" of a SACRED DEER."

Shame."

I googled the film before watching and it brought up greek mythology, after reading about that not the film it made perfect sense the first time i saw it. This might be classed as a spoiler or maybe not ??Basically in greek mythology a guy accidentally killed a deer of a god/queen something like that and in return she demanded he killed his own daughter to equal the odds, thats all you need to know watching the film.....Martin is the so called god, hence how he can do what he does, hence Kidman kissing his feet near the end.The music/score is excellent and creepy its a tragedy from the start to finish, I mark it down 1 for one reason only. even though as some things that are sad are creepy and twisted i wanted just that little bit more of a push to say OH MY GOD DID THEY JUST DO THAT, it never quite got me to say wow that shocked me.

How this kid was able to hold such a huge price that he felt was owed cause of his father's death I never fully understood.Feel the movie thought too much of itself.

This film is absolutely brilliant and it deserves to be add in the list of the best films of 2017, alongside with Dunkirk, Blade Runner 2049, It Comes at Night, Okja, etc. During the cinema screening, I realised that lot of people walked out of the movie theater and I asked myself: ''Why? The movie isn't bad. Give this film a time and chance to explain itself.''. Other people were commenting that it was great, but it was confusing and also disturbing, because of many brutal and violent scenes containing blood, wounds, organs and general fear of hospitals. I understand that this film isn't for everybody and that is really complicated at first, but if you watch the second time, you'll start to understand the whole point of the film. Here are some of the reasons why this film is amazing.It has interesting plot and story. It has everything what the psychological horror genre needs to have: a constant growing tension, interesting story that actually makes sense, a great terrifying, horrific, brutal and violent scenes that are related to the storytelling (that scene at the end in a living room, with ribbon covering eyes and a hunting rifle), the philosophy and moral behind the film, etc. The film has symbolism, metaphor and reference with the Greek mythology and some of the Greek tragedies.Acting, character development and dialogue between the characters were incredible. Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and rest of the cast did a fantastic job, but the actor who stole the most of the scenes and who was outstanding, was Barry Keoghan's role and character. Like in The Lobster, characters are related to absurdism. All of them are unemotional, artificial, cold-blooded, monotone and strange, but with a dose of realism. Normally, in those situations, characters would panic, constantly cry and scream, but they don't, which is why, at the end of the film, you'll get this terrifying and shocking feeling.Editing, pacing and lightning are perfect. The whole film has insane cinematography, beautiful, static, slow-moving and dynamic one-point perspective camera shots and angles, similar to Kubrick's directing film style and effect. Speaking of Kubrick, it also contains beautiful, tense and magnificent musical background and score, with classical music, famous symphonies and violin sounds and music.But the film has some mistakes. Sometimes it goes really slow and sometimes the music and violin sounds can be so loud, which can be annoying.Despite of those few mistakes, this film is one of the reasons and proofs why we love and enjoy the art of cinema and filmmaking. Yorgos Lanthimos needs to be add to the list alongside with other legendary directors and filmmakers. Absolutely artistic, well done, brilliant, original and creative.9/10"
169,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,12 January 2018,Too long to watch this shit,"FMD I sat and watched this with my wife for 2 hours, both of us saying that it must improve or at least something would jump out at us. Unfortunately it starts as shit, continues as shit and falls into a pile of shit.
This deserves an award for being the bigest sponge of peoples good time.
No one actor even gave me a glimpse of star skills or quality acting.
Don't waste your time, if you have time to kill, watch paint dry.
One thing that did give me a glimmer of positive is that outside the cinema everyone had the same impression that neither Colin Farrell nor Nicole Kidman have any skills and are puppets of the publicity machine."
170,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,12 January 2018,I know a horrible movie when I sit through it...........,"OK, 2 hours of dialogue too void of emotion to create any sense of character development. A group of actors void of emotion with every ridiculous line of script delivered. A story without any credible start, middle or end. What is this movie about? Are we supposed to like, hate............characters with zero interest in their roles? I would like to meet one or more of the people who enjoyed this movie and ask them ""why, why why?"" I gotta believe that Collin and Nicole are ashamed to have this performance in their filmography. Seriously, there's no way this disaster can be given above a 2 by anybody who actually sat thru it."
171,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,10 January 2018,WHY?!!! (did I waste my time and money?),"Pretentious, boring, tries too hard to be intellectual, but, in actuality, it""s vapid and annoying. It's as relevant as bad gas in a windstorm. It annoyed me so much that I felt compelled to write this review. I want to chase it with a very powerful vacuum cleaner. Better yet, I want my money back."
172,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,10 January 2018,"just like, you can't fake sexy - you can't fake good","Where do I begin? How's this? This movie is pure belching bore. Turdorama - If an artist takes a sh-t in the woods, is it art? No, It's this movie."
173,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,9 January 2018,DISTURBING,"The producer must be sick in the head . Seriously do no waste your time on this movie, it is by far the most disturbing movie I have ever seen and very disappointing that Collin Farrell and Nicole kidman would even agree to play in this ridiculous film."
174,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,8 January 2018,Weird..,"Steven, a charismatic surgeon, is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice after his life starts to fall apart, when the behavior of a teenage boy he has taken under his wing turns sinister. This movie was insane and weird and not in a good way, the actors had no chemistry (especially Kidman and Farrell) and above all it was so slow and boring from start to finish and it didn't even make sense to begin with and even tho the trailer showed some real emotion? It's not here on the released product. (0/10)"
175,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,8 January 2018,Do not lose your time watching it,"The movie is a total nonsense. And not even good acted. It is an example of what happens when a film director is too ambitious. Yet some critic might like the movie since critics tend to like movies that no one does.
An advise? Do not watch it"
176,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,8 January 2018,It's like the Director wanted to make a Kubrick style film but he actually forgot to watch one first. AWFUL!,"I make a point of watching independent film in order to help support my fellow film makers. After 20 years in the business I was in complete shock after watching this. I kept telling myself it was going to get better. What was this? Horror, Thriller, Sci-Fi? Nicole Kidman was the only reason I gave this film any stars at all."
177,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,7 January 2018,The Killing of a Stilted Career,"Colin Ferrell must choose: should I take another role in a big-budget action film where the CGI effects are more important than my ''acting"" or should I agree to appear in an arthouse film by a pretentious director and hope it catches Oscar buzz?
Answer: Career on life support. 
This movie is to offensive and dull (a difficult combo to pull off, actually) that people who paid to see it, saw it for free on an airplane or Greyhound, or heard about it from people who saw it, will avoid the next Colin Ferrell movies just in case he makes another bad decision about which role to take."
178,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,7 January 2018,A boring failure,"This is truly a film to avoid. For about 30/40 minutes I could go with the stilted dialogue and somewhat ponderous action of the film. It did create a vague sense of unease and the expectation that this would be somehow built upon. However, after a while it was clear that that was all there was. People behaving in artificial ways, having ridiculous unreal conversations and with no understandable motivation to their actions....except presumably to get the story to where the director wanted it to go.I would not focus my criticism on the actors but primarily on the director (or maybe also writer). Presumably the actors were told to deliver the lines in the silly manner, which soon seems like a tiresome parody, but just what the director thought the film would be to anyone but himself is a mystery to me.Basically, it seemed to me to be a self-indulgence...so I suppose I would hope that the director enjoyed it...cos very few others will."
179,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,7 January 2018,I've seen still images with more coherent stories.,"I was thrilled when I saw the trailer for ""The Killing of a Sacred Dear."" I'd thought that it would follow in the foot steps of child-gone psycho films such as ""Orphan"", ""The Bad Seed"" or ""The Good Son.""These kind of films have always intrigued me! It had an extremely high rating here on IMDB (Last time I trust it), so I'd figured it'd have been worth a watch. I can safely say that I will be sure to read the reviews prior to viewing next time. Where does one even begin? ""The Killing of a Sacred Dear"" managed to underwhelm on almost every front. I've never seen acting this wooden or line delivery this stilted in any professionally made film before. The cast attempts to portray a group of unrealistic, inhuman, underdeveloped and ultimately unlikable cast of characters that go through no significant changes, revelations or development over the course of the 2 hours I spent (wasted) watching this. There were oddities in the music choice and even issues in the sound mixing. There were scenes where ""ominous"" music was played over two characters having a casual conversation and scenes were the music was so loud it was drowning out the dialogue. The film is riddled with pointless and needlessly sexual deleted-scene esque material that could have been removed and would have improved the films pacing. Then there comes the leading issue. The story, or rather lack thereof. It's apparently based off of some archaic greek story without being changed or contextualized to make sense in a modern setting. We all know how it went. The father (just watched the movie and already forgot his name) killed Martin's father in surgery and now his son Martin wants to avenge the innocent...by targeting the innocent. (Again, not properly contextualized.) He makes the children of this family deathly ill. How he managed to do this is not even remotely hinted at or explained. Is he god? Is he psychic? Is he a WIZARD!? As far as the character of Martin goes, he's kind of just a creep. His history and character have no exploration other than his ""You took one of mine, now I take one of yours"" mentality. Anyway, I guess I can talk about the conclusion now. Or rather how much of a waste of a conclusion it is. It isn't deserved. It isn't satisfying. It isn't worthy of the 2 hour build up it receives. It doesn't even appear to have any impact or consequence as the film abruptly ends before the weight of the situation can be felt, that's assuming the events of the conclusion carried any weight at all. Overall, this is probably the worst movie I'll see in 2018."
180,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,7 January 2018,Wooden acting and terrible storyline.,"I decided to give this a try after seeing how high it had been rated.The storyline seemed intriguing and as it was classed as a horror/thriller would be right up my street. 10 minutes into the film I almost left. The acting is terribly wooden with lines delivered in a monotonous drone. Nicole Kidman is the only actor that kept me watching this movie. 
As the movie progressed I thought that it was picking up a little and the horror element was finally surfacing. How wrong I was.
As the film finished I stared at the screen expecting some other explanation as to who Martin was, why the family had just accepted was he had done to them and what was the reason for meeting in the diner. This didn't happen.
I think I will start looking elsewhere for movie ratings as the ones on Imbd seem to be falsified by the people that are proffiting from the unsuspecting filmgoers. Give this movie a wide berth. Even the few and far between scenes of gore couldn't pull it back."
181,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,7 January 2018,Let me fix your movie,"First, the main title card is shown - ""Killing of a Sacred Deer"".
And then, the missing title card - ""A greek tragedy"".There, now we know what the hell is happening - 8/10."
182,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,7 January 2018,Want my 2 hrs back!,"Bad acting + dumb plot = drivel. Colin Farrell continues to amaze me with the fact he can even find work. The ""children"" in the movie seem to have taken acting lessons from Dr. Spock from Star Trek. Wholly unsatisfying. I get the whole Greek tragedy arc but this is a movie that goes nowhere, painfully slowly. Sex scenes are not only bizarre, but also dull - a feat unto itself. By the end, you'll want them ALL dead, because the live versions of the main characters are so devoid of any actual soul, they might as well be ghosts. Read a few other negative reviews, and then be content that you wisely decided not to torture yourself."
183,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,6 January 2018,A Strange Morality Tale Where No One is Moral,Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-killing-of-sacred-deer-review.html
184,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,6 January 2018,Uneasy exploration of human nature and how we deal with our faults,"Without saying too much about the film, The killing of a sacred deer is one of those films where while watching it would be tough, uncomfortable and uneasy. However, coming out of it, allowing the film to settle and marinate there really is a lot to pick apart and analyze. Much like Yorgos Lanthimos' other film: ""The Lobster"" although compared to that, this film is all the intense and dark.The killing of a sacred deer stars Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman and Barry Keoghan (from Dunkirk) and really is about this mythology about redemption, facing yourself and revenge. There is a very interesting dynamic in the film that plays out giving off a strong sense of unnerving and chilling event unfolding. While the killing of a sacred deer isn't a pure horror it really achieves an effect that can be so much scarier than that of classic horror films and tropes. Like the Lobster, the killing of a sacred deer follows a society very much devoid of emotions in which people speak in a very matter of factly manner with very little variation in tone. This has come to be a sort of trademark for Lanthimos' films and is especially effective here under the brilliant acting of the entire cast, the highlights being the aforementioned three leads. This all goes to achieve the greater effect and deliver the overarching message about confronting one's faults that ties up wonderfully by the end of the film.The killing of the sacred deer's score was also beautifully written with this piercing edges adding to the suspense and uneasy feeling. Another thing is the camera work, this was done deliberately and so interestingly, by taking shots either from top to bottom or from bottom to top there is a sense of audiences peering into the conversations and almost stalking the characters adding an extra layer of storytelling. Overall, the film was well crafted and presents interesting themes but can feel dragged at certain times and does suffer from the pacing. Also, it was an uncomfortable viewing that takes time to really settle in and understand the true intentions of the film which is sure to draw a negative reaction immediately following the film."
185,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,6 January 2018,Almost no substance to the dialogue,"This movie is hugely disappointing, the actors deliver their lines almost by rote, without any depth or substance. The plot starts out relatively interestingly but plunges in a mire of confused behaviour and muddled dialogue. The characters say things that people would never say and sometimes keep quiet when a real person would almost certainly react.
Farrell and Kidman should be choosing their roles a bit better. This film is a waste of time and not worth watching."
186,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,5 January 2018,"Slow, weird with no payoff","Wow...first of all, I enjoy artsy non-Hollywood screenwriting. But I still want to know the same basis of all movies, what is going on, why, how and does it end.Everyone was talking in completely unemotional, robotic speech. It is not because of bad acting, they are purposely talking/interacting that way. You are waiting to find out why. You never find out why. The things that transpired during the movie you never find out how. And you not even sure what is going on. I was waiting for some explanation or twist or anything in the last ten minutes to justify or answer any of those questions....does not happen.There is enough engaging weirdness to keep you interested to find out that happens, but at the end, only one answer is provided out of the 10+ questions that you may have. I cannot see how this movie goes past a five in ratings."
187,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,3 January 2018,Gawbage - Up Against Three Billboards?,"Arbitrary, to say the most. Pick a genre; horror, drama, thriller, suspense, accidental comedy, etc.. Sacred Deer had all, but none of them. Loved the cast, loved the acting, production, blah. blah.
Vague story, no resolution, no love.
I could do better."
188,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2,3 January 2018,disappointing emotionless drivel,"Was expecting so much more than whatever this was. The trailer made this look so good, but it was such a waste. I only got 67 minutes in until I felt the need to skim through the rest to see what happened because I didn't care to wait. The characters and their portrayal are extremely flat and dumb. Had they had any common sense and gone to the police directly after a high schooler threatened to kill an entire family, this would've been a much shorter movie, and the characters would've seemed much more relatable. The people in this seem to have absolutely no emotion either. When a father shoved a doughnut down a kids throat, the mom standing directly next to him didn't seem to care at all, when any other person would be losing their minds. Additionally, every single line of dialogue is said in the most monotonous way possible. It's just so hard to care for anything in this film. It also didn't help that it took an entire 40 minutes for this film to pick up."
189,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,3 January 2018,IQ Tests To Follow,"Look we know the gay-ass French think they're better than us Americans, but geez, that much spotlight on this flick?
You want to go home and take a VERY long shower after wards.
I'm not going to get into the plot other than after watching it, you feel raped. And this is AFTER you saw Nicole Kidman's tits and snatch. Seriously. I WAS raped for having seen that.
Okay, so director Yorgos is an artist. I think. He fashions this odd-ball clipped dialogue that sounds like something no one would ever say, crazy framing, and LONG...and I mean LONG held shots that make your brain go to mush. It's like if ""Eraserhead"" got a lot of dialogue.
But somehow I was sucked into the atmosphere. How do I explain this other than to say a film made by a teenage Kubrick. In other words, he doesn't know what he wants but knows when he sees it.
There is a handjob by Kidman too. Maybe that's why the French/Cannes gave them a screenplay award."
190,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,1,2 January 2018,"Horror and a Mystery, I'll say!","If you're anxious to see the worst writing and directing possible, you'll be giddy with pleasure. As an added benefit, this disaster also adds the most unlikable cast on earth to the mix. It's billed as a horror and mystery. The horror is the fact that I actually paid to sit through this mess. The mystery was why I thought a movie with Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and Alicia Silverstone would be worth 2 hours of my life.No added spoilers. The entire movie is a time spoiler."
191,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,1 January 2018,Another Lanthimos gem,"After the epic and vaunted ""Dogtooth,"" Yorgos Lanthimos recollects his sangfroid and regroups in Cincinnati to channel afresh the deeply dysfunctional archetypal relationships he knows. He here uses to fine effect a number of subtle filmmaker tricks to evoke a genuine, primitive sense of dread. 7 stars and not 8 or 9, however, because like a Peter Greenaway film, this one resonates and resonates with itself, turning in on itself like salt water taffy, without ever reaching authentic resolution or explication. Certain scenes have such bloodless coldness and unnecessariness as to make life seem garish and bleak. Celebration of life warts and all, self-discrepant though it generally is, would seem to be an ironic ubermotif in Lanthimos' oeuvre, but that thread runs thin here and then vanishes, no greenroom with champagne in it for anyone. Or is that too his point? Distilled acting from Colin Farrell and Barry Keoghan. I'm ready for Nicole Kidman to retire her nude filmic self."
192,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,1 January 2018,Lamp,"A sense of dread pervades in the initial scenes that consists of stilted conversations (such lines of dialogue I love hearing being delivered by actors that is very much reminiscent of Lanthimos's previous English-languaged work The Lobster) in what seemed like a display of paternal concern of revered cardiologist Steven towards a teenage son of his former patient, Martin.As a mysterious illness befalls on Steven's two kids, the audience witnesses the helplessness of the Murphy household that eventually shakes the doctor's once-confident faith in modern medicine. He then soon discovers a latent evil on the brink of festering his whole family where they devolve into a pack of scared animals.The voyeurisic feel of those wide shots of interiors adds to the creepy aura as the story delves into the darker side of humanity. Barry Keoghan gives a loathsome portrayal of an unhinged teenage boy that serves to complement the steady acting of Farrell as the beleaguered doctor and unflappable performance of Kidman as the doctor's wife. Silverstone's stint as Martin's distraught mother is also noteworthy and lends to the depressing aspect of the film. A very haunting musical score (reminds me of the Kubrick film The Shining) that serves a sort of compass to emphasize the gripping moments in the film to grab ahold of the viewer's attention that might easily be mislead by the Murphy family's attempts in masking their anguish which somehow manifests once in while in their near-silent despondency as they struggle to put up a pretense that their lives are still not in shambles. My rating: A-flat."
193,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,31 December 2017,Runs slowly and feels esoteric,"After seeing Afonofsky's Mother I thought I may not stumble upon more disturbing and strange movie in quite some time. And I was wrong. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is as weird as it gets. Firstly, this film has some of David Lynch's feeling to it. It runs slowly and feels aberrant and nefarious. Secondly, all horror elements are entirely psychological in nature. There you have a combination which only few are going to be able to withstand, let alone enjoy.If you fall into this group of people, equip yourself with forbearance. Don't expect to understand it at first. This is one of the movies I like to describe as being enjoyable post festum, where you have to put together different parts of the movie and make some sense out of it. Contrary to that, it may even be the case that searching for and adequate interpretation only ruins the experience, as Lynch once described his Mullholand Dr. No matter which impression you get, Killing of a Sacred Deer is certainly a film difficult to put in words or understand correctly since there is no ""correct way"" to it. That may be the explanation of most of the low rating reviews here on IMDb: you can't appreciate it if you approach it with too conservative mindset.A thing that troubles me with this types of movies is that I always get the impression that directors putter a little too much with New age elements which most of us are not aware of. There are a lot of them in this movies and the central motif of a scapegoat is of course one of them. That may be another explanation of many low rating reviews: people are sick and tired of primitive concepts being rendered as esoteric.Taken everything together, I'd still recommend you to at least give it a try if you find yourself falling into the upper mentioned group of people. If you find it too boring in the first half an hour, you may happily throw away the rest."
194,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,29 December 2017,i'll bury you in the yard..,"The Killing Of A Sacred DeerYorgos aces in keeping the audience enrooting for the lead characters till the end and gives them enough homework to even work it out, but this time he seemed way too dark on its tone; exhilarating but dark."
195,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,29 December 2017,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"Recurrent in Lanthimos' movies the discomfort here is almost unbearable. Inventive and intriguing, the film develops around it's own logic not applicable to the real world but full of meaning in the ""Lanthimos' universe"". Gradually, Steven (Colin Farrell) finds himself in a nightmare that he can't wake up to and the spectator is sentimentally abducted into it with him. Anna (Nicole Kidman) is the voice of reason here, answering the necessary questions for the continuity of the story. All the characters are unnatural but none seems displaced. Social and moral themes are strongly present and Lanthimos strives more to question them than to respond. It's agonizing, just like bleeding eyes, but pleasurable to watch."
196,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,26 December 2017,A24 with another solid thriller,"Here's what I ask myself either during or after a film... ""Am I feeling something"" or ""Did this film make me feel anything"" if I answer Yes to either then I consider the film to be good.I felt many things throughout The Killing of a Sacred Deer so to me it was a very good film. I felt dread, I said WTF of several occasions, I wanted certain characters to be okay and others not so much... It hit all the marks a film should. A24 has consistently cranked out these sort of Marquee thrillers/horrors. Some of which I thought were good films BUT pretty pretentious as well. I get that some people thought this was another exercise in prententiousness... but honestly... I don't think Lanthimos took things seriously enough to merit that judgement. The dialogue itself, the way it is delivered shows that I think. All in all, a very solid film...a throwback to hitchcock."
197,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,25 December 2017,Apsolutely brilliant,"One of the best movies i've seen recently.Fantastic acting by both kidman and Farell. The movie was very loyal to the Iphygenia tragedy, apsolutely marvelous.You just cant stop watching it"
198,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,,23 December 2017,It's weird,"This film tells the story of a cardiac surgeon, who lives with his wife and two children. One day, a young man shows up in his life, and his life is not the same again.It is interesting that the characters are all devoid of emotions. They deliver conversations in the most monotonous tone possible. There are only two moments that a character shows emotions, and they are very brief displays. The conversations are weird and often socially awkward and inappropriate, making this film just very weird."
199,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,22 December 2017,"Entertaining, (depends on your mental stabillity)","This movie connects with me and any other people who accociate similar personalities with the characters in this movie, the story-line however didnt make sense, as it didn't reveal or show to us, how the young boy controlled this family and afflicted them with disabilities, i however enjoyed this movie, as it had some entertaining scenes, it stuck true to what it says, 'pschological horror', only however, some people did not understand this movie then others."
200,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,22 December 2017,Lanthimos is back with another creepy weird horror drama,Lanthimos ups his game again with a weird tale that makes you double guess the obvious answers he gives you. The film plays with your expectation but knowing Lanthimos it's not a big surprise where it ended up. The creepy atmosphere created by the camera and music while the characters act extra polite marks the horror that is hidden in plain sight. There are not too many directors who can pull off something weird like this with such neatness.
201,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,22 December 2017,Not for everyone,"I remember the time I watched this movie's trailer, it left me feeling really curious. Once I started the movie I fell in love with it, the soundtrack the acting everything felt perfect. I undertand why some people find this movie distrubing. it is a bit of a thiller which is sort of a dark themed genre so if you are not into that just avoid it. Asides from that I´ll highly recommend it it´s weird, diffrent, unexpected, but as I said not everyone enjoy this type of films. This is the same director of the lobster which i also loved and recommend."
202,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,20 December 2017,Classic Psychological Horror,"I only watched this movie because it was labeled as a horror movie, a genre I'm very much fond of and also because it cast the A-listers like Kidman and Farrell. Good cast and very proficient, quality acting from them. Barry Keoghan (the boy who portrayed Martin) was the most impressive in my opinion. He was perfectly suited for the character. His nonchalant, unflappable expressions played a vital role to depict his character as a diabolical one. Kidman played her part albeit her character was peripheral at times, but Farrell put in a classy performance himself.I noticed a tension from the very opening scene. Tension between the characters. There was always a suspense. And it always felt like something sinister is gonna happen. That's where the background music comes in. It was so eerie and creepy at times that, just by the sound of it, it felt very gruesome and distressing. And I have to say that Farrell's beard played a big part in the build up.If you're a fan of psychological thrillers or horrors, you'll find it very compelling. Your eyes will be glued to the screen until you've seen the end game. And I got to tell you, I didn't expect the way it culminated to the finale.
 
In my opinion ""The Killing of Sacred Deer"" is the third best movie of its kind this year right after ""Get Out"" and ""Split"". And it's not very easy to pull of a movie of this kind with a story-line so macabre and nightmarish. Most definitely going to recommend this to psychological-movie lovers."
203,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,19 December 2017,i understood the messages,"Every doctor who lets a patient die, should kill a member from his family. he should live with the same pain he provoked to the others. beautiful hands that inspire you are deadly. women make everything to obtain what she wants. even masturbate a man. innocent children must die for their parents mistakes.
the message is absurd. no one will want to be a doctor and it does not make sense to kill one more person."
204,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,17 December 2017,Confused!,"A movie that one can't help but finishing it despite all negativity gained is simply a good one.
I enjoyed everything painfully, waited to this awkward family to unmask as they seemed to be unreal, but they kept acting gorgeously till the damn end!
It's a terrible one to watch and a big loss if not!"
205,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,10,17 December 2017,Hard game like real life!,"The movie is undoubtedly fascinating and even after viewing it is not fully understood, although perhaps it does not matter, I feel that the movie basis is laid in a large a number of own creators thinking, at the back of screen, and their creativity in movie making, it tight, and especially music, so strong and camera motion is great! Even you stop to notice that and go deeper into the atmosphere with fear!So, who is a friend and or with psychology side by side, maybe you noticed that all about psychological games, in fact for this reason and decide to write a couple of words!
Because the events are meaningless, this kid is not a magician and does not possess black forces, he is in loss and going to manipulates and quite a successful strange way, hard and seriously, the psychic terror is the most terrible!, you will not turn to the police, and obviously, it becomes clear that the final result here seems to be like he says, when you are so deeply in this game! And it is game, that everyone believed and not argue with own fantasies about this 'situation'. He manipulates hard. And for me this movie and the events on the screen are very psychological games and in real life between us it has own big place too, manipulations, manipulations, loneliness and crazy loneliness (loneliness is not crazy thing, in fact, its ok to be, but there it overdramatic, for family where man dies on surgery), about how we should understand ourselves and our motives, emotions and subjugate what we are saying, thinking or overthinking in real, and create own reality, fantasies, illness, and worries! The film really holds to the end when trying to understand, but the director and the script itself are not written to understand it, only to play our imagination, guesses and the same game as the main characters among themselves, hmm, and then I remembered about mindfulness and how it really important..."

208,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,6,15 December 2017,"Not for everyone, which is a good thing","I read through the reviews and there are a lot that are plain negative. Their reasons are that they don't understand what went on, it was to gory or written for sadists or mad people.
Wow, I am glad to say, this film wasn't meant for those people.I watched it and wanted to hate it. I hate films with famous people in it, so I waited for the bad bits to start, to prove myself right. However the longer it went on, the more I liked it.
Sorry people who don't like this film, I did!It wasn't boring or slow, that is always said by those that expect explosions and shock scares and monsters and guns and fast cars and hectic stuff. Well you won't get that here. Go and watch some brainless Marvel action movie if you need to be entertained by loud noises and colours and people talking fast.If you like atmosphere, good acting, well shot, weird, interesting and most of all completely different to normal predictable Hollywood movies, then you should try this. Oh and you must not be offended or scared of 'unethical' behaviour.This is NOT a safe space. This is a solidly different movie to the normal drivel. Dare it if you have the patience."
209,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,14 December 2017,"this parable lands on its feet alright, but precariously veering into a missed opportunity","Greek social satirist Yorgos Lanthimos' modern-day re-construction of the ancient Greek play IPHIGENIA AT AULIS, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER preserves his maverick wheezes in the film's textual composition: a curse of tit-for-tat disregarding any logical explication, and bolstered by a robust cast, Lanthimos' pull-push machination of its camera's slick movement, this parable lands on its feet alright, but precariously veering into a missed opportunity. Its eye-opening gambit is a close-up to a pulsating heart during a real-time open-heart surgery, a metaphor one might conjecture that a process awaits to unpick something vital, seismic, but hidden under the surface and taken granted by us. The story follows Colin Farrell's Steven Murphy, a cardiologist who apparently has a perfect family with wife Anna (Kidman) and two children, Kim (Cassidy, sturdily braving herself in a both emotionally and physically challenging role) and her younger brother Bob (Suljic, an angelic guardian of curly long hairs), it is polarized from the quirky domestic setting in DOGTOOTH (2009), Lanthimos' stepping stone into international auteur-dom. However, the quirky part is infused through the advent of Martin (Keoghan), a soft-spoken teenager whose relation with Steven appears at once cordial but fishy, blokeish but insidious, and when Martin's aggression into Steven's household hits that invidious note, something psychic occurs, which blatantly exhorts Steven to choose a sacrifice from his family to atone for his misconduct. Remolding a Hellenic tragedy into a contemporary scenario requires a critical revamp to modernize the precept of source material, and this is precisely what Lanthimos fails to do, it is Steven's remorse, that doesn't crystallize in his behavior after his offspring being subjected to Martin's punitive curse, he is distraught, desperate, but it seems that the proposition of trading his own life for one of his children, has never floated up in his mind, after all, the deer are innocent, he is the sinner of, to say the very least, medical negligence. Through a cacophony of discordant soundscape, Steven and his family's psychological strains have been pushed into every nook and cranny of our sensorium, nerve-racking, absurd and bedazzled with gallows humor (crawling critters are a part of the furniture of horror flicks), till the uneasy Russian roulette solution. Performance-wise, Farrell competently parlays his reserved, imploding mode from THE LOBSTER (2015) into this familial turmoil, but his portrayal of Steven inclines to malign a man's softness, in a sense, he is punished not only for his slip on the operation table but also his namby-pamby indecision/immaturity, which in turn, gives Kidman's Anna a stage to shine in her more controlled, sensible, motherly sway, and Kidman seizes our admiration with her scathing gaze and haunting resignation, when she realizes the inevitability, incidentally, Anna's mobility becomes a constantly distracting concern whenever she moves because she is prophesied to be the next one falls into paralysis. Although Martin's psychic power is the elephant-in-the-room conveniently mythified, Barry Keoghan is a bracing discovery of the next big thing, a joli-laid in appearance but effortlessly connives to consolidate Martin's not well-adjusted psyche beneath the camouflage of benignancy, a chilling but also ensorcelling bravura. Lastly, let's digress back to the conjecture of its opening gambit, what does TKOASD unpick? Overall, it doesn't acquit itself as a forensic allegory of any modern malaise (as in his three previous works) but is considerably taken away by its surrealistic flourish and the time-honored moral debate it provokes, it is an old-wine-in-the-new-bottle dilemma, however luscious does the wine taste, it is always the design of the bottle needs to be updated, preferably, in a progressive direction."
210,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,13 December 2017,Everyone who gave 1/10 must be banned for life,"A man who plays God for a living meets a boy who chooses to play Devil in Yorgos Lanthimos' chilling and breathtaking ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" Once again, as he did with ""The Lobster,"" Lanthimos is working in a deeply metaphorical register, using an impossible situation to illuminate relatable human fears. The result is a mesmerizing thriller, a movie that asks questions with no good answers and traps us within its terrifying and bizarre situation with little hope for a happy ending. With uniformly great performances throughout the cast and Lanthimos' stunning eye for detail and composition, this is one of the most unforgettable films of the year.Colin Farrell, reuniting with Lanthimos and a bit bushier and grayer than before, plays Dr. Steven Murphy, a noted and respected surgeon. Externally, he would seem to have it all. He's powerful and successful with a gorgeous wife named Anna (Nicole Kidman), who happens to be an ophthalmologist. They have two children-15-year-old Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and younger Bob (Sunny Suljic). Steven has befriended a 16-year-old named Martin (Barry Keoghan of ""Dunkirk""), the son of a man who died on his operating table a few years ago. Exactly what happened in that room, and how and why Steven has tried to stay close with Martin is unclear at the beginning of the film. Lanthimos often keeps histories and motivations vague, allowing us to fill in the blanks as the film progresses.From the beginning, something seems vaguely off with the relationship between Steven and Martin. The doctor introduces him as a friend of his daughter's, but he's not. And he buys the kid presents, even inviting him over for dinner. Martin becomes friends with Steven's kids, and a romantic interest for Kim, but there's a dark undercurrent here from frame one. Something's just not quite right in the Murphy household, and it's not only that the good doctor likes his wife to pretend to be under general anesthesia when he has sex with her. The Murphys seem to be just a little off, and Martin more than a little.Then Bob can't get out of bed. His legs don't work. Not long after, he stops eating. Martin tells Steven what's going on. It's justice. Steven took his father, and now a member of his family must die. The scales must be balanced. Steven can choose to kill one of his family members and end the nightmare, but they will continue to lose the use of their limbs, refuse to eat, and eventually bleed from the eyes if he does not make a decision. Steven, being a man of science, turns to medicine to explain what's happening to his family, refusing to believe that it's some sort of cosmic karma coming to get him. Thematically, Lanthimos is playing with the differences between science and the supernatural. Steven plays God. He saves lives and he makes mistakes that take lives. And he sees the world in that kind of black and white. Martin breaks down his perfectly controlled worldview, and demands something rarely asked of the gods, personal sacrifice.Working with his regular cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis again, and a multi-talented team of designers, Lanthimos delivers one of the most visually striking films of the year, a movie that recalls prime Polanski in its claustrophobic tension but more distinctly feels like an entirely new voice in horror. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" takes place in a world of clean lines and kitchens as antiseptic as operating rooms. It's this world of suburban perfection that Martin, and Lanthimos, deconstructs with a waking nightmare. There's something about the cool, detached world of ""Sacred Deer"" that makes it all the more terrifying. Of course, fallible man must be punished in a world this perfectly refined and lacking in common humanity. It almost feels like Martin gives Steven an out early in the film, inviting him to his more ""everyday"" world in which they watch ""Groundhog Day"" (tellingly, another movie about a man who must learn a lesson to stop a physically impossible situation) and his mother (Alicia Silverstone) demands he try her tart. But the God won't deign to play with the mortals, and so he must be hurled from his throne.And here's where we get to the title. Late in the film, we learn that one of the characters wrote an A+ essay on Iphigenia, a Greek myth that centers on the killing of a sacred deer by Greek leader Agamemnon. Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, punished Agamemnon, and the only way to remove the punishment is for the leader to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia. Is the modern surgeon the equivalent of Agamemnon? Is the child who lost his father before he could talk about puberty with him Artemis? Lanthimos never draws straight lines, but the parallel is illuminating. He makes films designed to start conversations, to leave viewers startled and shaken. And he's smart enough to use Greek myths, pitch black humor, and chilling horror in equal amounts.It helps that he's clearly at a point in his career where the right actors want to work with him. It feels like we're finally at a time when we can recognize that Colin Farrell has been pretty great for a long time, choosing to work with challenging directors who bring out different edges of his ability even this late into his career. He's phenomenal here, finding the shades of a man whose greatest sin may be his refusal to admit he's only human. In the end, that may be the message of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer""-when you play God, you must deal with the consequences. The Lanthimos-Farrell dynamic is one of those relationships in which the creator and actor are so clearly on the same page that it's invigorating.That's a good word for ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" It's a film that challenges viewers in such fascinating ways and feels so refined in its filmmaking that it's invigorating to watch. It's a rare movie indeed that can be this alternately terrifying, hysterical, strange, and heartbreaking, often in the same scene. Like the Greek myth that inspired the film, it feels powerful enough to be timeless."
211,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,13 December 2017,When an allegorical movie becomes absurdly pretentious.,"If you like ""The Lobster"" by Lanthimos, here, expect something different. Although we still have in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" a very strange screenplay, here its attempt to be super symbolic and metaphorical reminds me more of ""Mother!"", by Darren Aronofsky.I am not sure if there's a current trend to adapt to the big screen Biblical stories or greek-roman myths, but I suspect this is the case. In this movie, we see an allegory of the myth of ""Iphigenia"". A heart surgeon (Colin Farrell) one day has performed a surgery on a man, but this doctor was drunk. The patient died during the procedure. His son wants revenge, and makes a deal with the surgeon - he either has to kill a member of his family, or all his family members will die from a magical, unexplainable-by-medicine series of events: limb paralysis, eye bleeding, and sudden death. After that, the movie is all about this moral dilema - what should the doctor do? Kill one of his children or watch all his family members die? And that's it. This is the plot. The first and second acts are absurdly slow, the soundtrack is just there to disguise how cold this movie is, and it's only in the third act that the movie actually SETS OFF. Cast's performances, especially Barry Keoghan's, is quite impressive. But a cast cannot save a movie. Its desperation to seem to be ""artsy"" and ""allegoric"" makes this a very pedantic work of art, just like ""Mother!"", by Aronofsky.It is, for sure, a nice movie to distract yourself. It's good entertainment. But it's not valuable. Lanthimos probably thinks this movie is better than it really is."
212,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,12 December 2017,Dad is sacred,"The movie The Killing of a Sacred Deer directed by Yorgos lanthimos has a twisted, strange and convoluted story revolving around Martin ( excellent acting by Barry keoghan from Dunkirk). Martin's dad died after having cardiac surgery and martin holds Dr Steven Murphy ( played by Colin Farell)responsible for dad's death. Martin sets out to seek revenge on Dr Murphy by infiltrating into his life and family. Martin gets close to Dr Murphy's teenage daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and son Bob ( played by Sunny Sujic). martin is extremely well mannered when he interacts with Dr Anna ( Nicole Kidman). Martin is cruel in his intentions and causes havoc in family. The film focuses on psychosomatic aspects of cruelty. Barry Keoghan is very impressive as Martin . Enjoyed movie. needed editing."
213,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,1 December 2017,"Great Directing, Not So Great Script","A problem with this, or any, mythical adaptation in the form of a suspense thriller is that said adaptations cannot claim to be realistic in the sense that the audience can empathize with the characters. Once you bring in superpowers or magic of some sort, you break the internal realism and consistency of the movie, and the suspense disappears. This was the problem with the script, I feel.If it was possible that Martin had done what he did with the aid of some ancient, unrecorded poisonous substance (or some other even remotely believable device, it would have been a great mystery. The movie didn't even have to explain what Martin did, but it had to show the possibility that Martin was just another sociopath.Overall, great directing, cinematography, and score, but the script fails."
214,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,27 November 2017,"Stunning and disturbing, a brilliant and moving film","Yorgos Lanthimos returns for a dark and disturbing film about revenge and consequences. Cardiologist Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) has an odd relationship with a young boy Martin (Barry Keoghan), helping out the boy but lying to his family. It is later revealed that he was responsible for Martin's father's death during a surgery that Steven may have been drinking prior to performing. Martin starts to insinuate more into Dr. Murphy's life as he receives presents, shows up at his work uninvited, and eventually receives an invitation from his family. Steven's wife Anna Murphy (Nicole Kidman) is welcoming to the strange boy but Martin has a bad influence on Steven's two kids Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and Bob (Sunny Suljic). Martin tries to return the favor by inviting Steven over to his house but when his mother (Alicia Silverstone) starts to flirt with him.The film takes a sinister turn when Bob cannot use his legs and no medical tests reveal what is wrong with him. Martin drags Steven out of the hospital room and informs him that each one of his family members will exhibit the symptoms: loss of use of their legs, loss of appetite, bleeding from the eyes, and death. Martin explains that since he lost a member of his family, Steven must lose one of his family members. The symptoms will progress and worsen unless Steven chooses one of his family to die. Steven is dismayed but skeptical of Martin's claim and tries to make Bob eat but his son refuses. They continue to run tests but the doctors are convinced it is psychological. Steven tries to push Bob to walk but has no luck. Meanwhile, Martin has struck up a romantic relationship with Kim. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
215,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,24 November 2017,A psychological thrill ride.,"As a thrill ride in amusement park offers you a relatively safe opportunity to experience a realistic feeling of near-lethal situations, this movie does the same on psychological level.The movie allows you, for a limited time to experience anxiety, shame, humiliation, depression and contradictory feelings - on a level, that in real world might make you need counseling.It's not a ""feel good movie"", but it is a thrill ride, which will not allow you to relax for a single moment. In the easier sections, you already see the next twist coming and by instinct you hold even tighter on your seat."
216,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,17 November 2017,Punch-drunk perfection,"Yorgos Lanthimos seems to have inherited the mantle of the great Luis Bunuel, for this movie, like its predecessor THE LOBSTER, is essentially a satire on humanity's prodigious talent for not taking responsibility for its actions. The mythical underpinnings here give the film a sure sense of direction and overall structure, but Lanthimos' style is all his own -- the restrained, almost deadpan, performances he elicits from his actors; the pared-down dialogue, teetering a lot of the time on the edge of very dark humour indeed; the almost antiseptic visual canvas which takes so little to sully. This is Planet Yorgos.It's two hours of almost non-stop psychological disturbance, so prepare to emerge a little punch-drunk, but it is totally worth undergoing the experience.It's worth mentioning in passing that the performances are terrific, and that Colin Farrell goes from strength to strength now his juvenile lead days are behind him."
217,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,15 November 2017,Taking a life means breaking a life.,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer leads you into a clinical, despairing spiral of revenge, dark humour and banality, releasing you only at the very end with an inhuman conclusion.We open with open-heart surgery gone awry, then two doctors discussing their watches as they throw away their bloodied gloves. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is the heart surgeon in question, who befriends the darkly enticing Martin, a local youth. We're not sure who Martin is, but it becomes clear he has a stake in Steven's family, including his ophthalmologist wife Anna and especially their children Bob and Kim.Martin and Steven meet frequently, and as Martin is entering adolescence he has all sorts of questions on adulthood. Kim, herself, is blooming and falls for the quirky Martin, before her brother Bob is struck by lower-body paralysis. Kim meets the same fate. What's going on? It seems to be psychological, but we get a dark hint as Kim is said to have delivered a great lecture on the myth of Iphigenia, and this myth is made life.Steven, being incurably logical and earth-based, cannot fathom that the fates are involved in a spiral of revenge that will force him to make an unearthly choice. How he arrives to that choice and the ensuing back and forth between he, Martin and his family are fine moments to watch and absorb. Especially funny is a conversation between Kim and Bob about Bob's possessions, which will leave some in stitches.Highly recommended for those looking for that dark, cold movie that can work your cockles. General Anaesthesia never looked so different as well."
218,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,15 November 2017,"Ambiguous Yet Clear in Thought, Beautiful Yet Ugly, Bizarre Yet Superb","A Surgeon's guilt leads him to mentor the teen son of a deceased patient. After weeks of diner lunches and awkward afternoon walks along the riverside, Steven (Farrell), our duplicitous leading man finds that Martin (Keoghan) has some seriously sinister plans in-store for him and his young family; a plan that ultimately puts Steven in an impossible excruciating moral dilemma.This is essentially the plot The Killing of a Sacred Deer, the latest mad experiment concocted by the same warped mind that gave you the similarly themed Dogtooth (2009) and the deadpan black comedy The Lobster (2015). But lest you've seen either of those films, nothing can really prepare you for what this twisted little romp is really about and how this film goes about achieving its own ambitions. Director Yorgos Lanthimos isn't just an idiosyncratic art-house director with a wild hair for film-school suspense. No this guy is a cinematic mad scientist who takes all things familiar and makes them wholly unfamiliar by breaking everything down to the bare essentials.What do I mean by this? Well for one the story doesn't ever feel the need to explain itself. In an interview famed director Alfred Hitchcock was once asked why the characters in his films never call the police. His answer was, ""Because it's boring."" Lanthimos seems to be taking that same approach not only for the crime elements of the story but the very mechanisms that make the story possible. It is never explained (nor does it need to be) how Martin goes about doing what he does. The only logic that counts exists within Martin's fractured state of mind; and we just have to live with whatever twisted logic happens to be exposed by the frame at the time.While the story is very much in the vein of Hitchcock, the cinematography just screams Kubrickian other-worldliness. Everything is shot with a streamline economy so that every scene, every character, every plot point is tailor made for maximum ambiguity while never straining the limits of a traditional narrative. Yet despite its perfection in relaying information and theme, every frame and gently sweeping pan serves to overwhelm the viewer with a near constant feeling of unease. How much unease? Well the film literally starts with an un-obscured view of open-heart surgery. Whatever feeling you're liable to have while watching something like that (shock, disgust, anxiety, etc.) is going to be your default for two hours so buckle up.In comparison to other outstanding horror films released this year, Sacred Deer certainly holds its own - even if the spirit of its horror is less Get Out (2017), or Jigsaw (2017) and more Werner Herzog oppressively reading Grimm Fairy tales. Yet in comparison to Lanthimo's other works, Sacred Deer feels like it doesn't have that same immutable fearlessness. That may have less to do with the film itself and more to do with the genre. The Lobster may have dabbled in some horror tropes but it was first and foremost a black satire on romantic love. Our expectations were naturally pretty limited in regards to ""how far"" they're willing to go with the premise. Thus when it really did ""go that far"" the wickedness of the satire felt all that more dangerous. Any satire of familial love on the part of Sacred Deer is played less with a sense of wickedness and more with a sense of dread. It still feels dangerous, but only to the extent the extent of bodily harm.Thankfully the cast are perfectly suited for finding the flawed, ugly and human parts to their off-putting characters. Farrell is at his subdued, disquieted best as a complacent everyman suddenly put into a lose-lose scenario. Nicole Kidman, Sunny Suljic and especially the brooding Raffey Cassidy have between them all the cunning instincts needed to make their characters sympathetic while harboring the animosities needed to make the situation believable.The real standout however is Barry Keoghan who takes what would have otherwise been a one-note Machiavelli and elevates him to the level of an uncaring God. His malevolence is scary not only because of his forceful actions and their inherent power imbalance but because there's nonchalance in everything he does. There's a void where his empathy and moral compass should be. So to compensate, he adapts a sense of justice where extreme measures are regular and they're seemingly the most human thing about him.Keoghan's abrasive performance alone is definitely worth the admission price for horror fans, film fans and those already familiar with Lanthimos's unique approach to storytelling. Combined with the film's fable-like clarity of thought and this thing suddenly becomes a worthy piece of art crying to be studied and argued about for years. But for casual audiences, Sacred Deer may prove too outwardly bizarre and too much of a dialectic gut-punch to walk away satisfied. Which is a shame because I think Lanthimos is actually aiming for the unwitting who settled for whatever just started at the cinemas because Ragnarok sold out."
219,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,13 November 2017,The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),"The Lobster definitely took my by surprise in 2015. Everything about that film appealed to me. From Colin Farrell's dead delivery, to the creative and completely absurd nature of storytelling. So when I heard about  Yorgos Lanthimos making another film with Farrell involved, I was game. I went in completely blind; not knowing a single thing about the film. While not as strong as the Lobster, the film is unique in its own right and is one that still leaves an imprint.The film is about Steven Murphy (Farrell) a surgeon who seems to be involved with a boy named Martin. Their relationship is weird and we don't really know what to think until we find out the vengeful reason for their acquaintance. Martin's father died on the operating table due to Murphy's negligence and in return he must kill one member of his family or face the consequence of the death of his wife and two kids all together. His family go through three stages; paralysis in the legs, extreme loss of appetite, and then bleeding from the eyes which results in death.As you can tell, the plot is fairly absurd, rivaling itself with that of The Lobster. The dialogue delivery has that similar monotone, deadpan nature as that of The Lobster. The score is overbearing and jarring at times. The film is dark and yet gorgeously filmed. The dialogue and a few of the characters are idiosyncratic and thus you can find bits of humor in some of the situations. Lanthimos brings forth another wild, weird, and creative entity. I don't think its as strong as The Lobster was but its still nice to see how things unfold in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. The running time for the film is quite long which stunts some of the plot development and pads but it doesn't detract too much from the film. 7/10"
220,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,13 November 2017,"Dark, Haunting, and Uncomfortable","The Killing of a Sacred Deer starts off very slowly, very little happens in the first 40 minutes or so besides awkward interactions between the characters. Even those interactions are lifeless and the characters are deadpan and unemotional, in the same style Yorgos Lanthimos used in ""The Lobster."" The only response the beginning of the film can draw from the audience is the discomfort that the characters should be feeling, but don't seem to be aware of.Then, there is a sudden stylistic change and the film suddenly becomes dark and twisted very unexpectedly. The film becomes true horror without any of the classic buildup. There is not a single jumpscare or traditional horror cliché, but it still managed to terrify me more than anything I have seen in a long time without ever raising my pulse.Nicole Kidman delivers a powerful performance while Barry Keoghan shines as a deeply disturbed and strangely powerful teenager. The film would have an even greater effect if the characters were actually relatable, but instead they all exist in some sort of other dimension where many people are deadpan and oddly direct. It also would have benefited from a greater urgency to actually begin the story near the beginning of the film, rather than 40 minutes in."
221,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,12 November 2017,Style Didn't Land Well With Me,"I'm giving TKoaSD a higher rating than would be indicated by my enjoyment of it. You know when you realize that you are watching a well done piece, but it just isn't your thing? The dialogue was stilted. Intentionally, of course. My best guess is that it was supposed to give the character's voices a cadence that one would use were they telling the story aloud. I don't know that to be true, though.I do know that it kept taking me out of the moment. It reminded me of dialogue from The Room by Tommy Wisseau, but delivered by top caliber actors. Once that mental image entered my brain, it wouldn't leave. Every line went through that filter thereafter.The story itself is ironically unique, as I believe it is an adaptation of a mythological story. It has that nonsensical cause and effect one expects from ancient fables.There were some moments I found enjoyable in their successful attempt to make the audience uncomfortable.Fantastic performances all around with a standout job by Barry Keoghan. Expect great things from this one.One last thing I will say for it. Even though I didn't particularly enjoy it overall, it stuck with me. I did like that."
222,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,10 November 2017,The Devil Needs An Invite,"Tragedies are best played out in secret. The participants must be self-conscious to a fault, and the curse facilitator needs to have an insatiable score to settle. A Cincinnati suburb is fashioned into a Greek amphitheater, and the gods of wine and harvest are the only ones watching.This deadly production has a singular moral, but it is not being taught to the audience. Steven, the star surgeon is the unfortunate recipient of this mythical lesson. With a wife retrofitted to his peculiar kinks, a son quick to adjust career paths, and a daughter who is an A+ expert on the horrors he faces, Steven has yet to make a sacrifice worthy of his current comfort.Martin sticks like gum on Steven's sole. The boy's leverage is secret and potent, easily masked by tidy alibis and half truths. Steven passes professional blame onto anesthesiologists for malpractice fatalities. Step one is to properly administer sleep. The knife wielders rarely are the killers. Martin wishes to change that.Steven has outstretched his wings, cradling Martin in nondescript diners and parking garages. When he gives the young man a watch that dwarfs his own, Martin's attachment reaches the final phase. One last peace offering remains before a game of addition spirals into subtraction. Survival will be reduced to haircuts and epic recitals. The suburban theater bloats with situational irony, the plot engulfs sexuality and innocence in the same gulp. The modern mansion shrinks to a living room, and the villain disappears into coffee mugs at an incomplete booth. The city with medical advances ten or more years beyond their sun- burst automobiles would suggest, has no answer for the scientific Steven. His careful domestic construction falls apart with about as much explanation as Bill Murray's temporal tornado. The killing cannot be left up to chance no matter how much he spins around the goddess' command."
223,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,10 November 2017,Modern tragedy,"A mysterious drama, inspired by the myth of Iphigenia, as recounted by Euripides in ""Iphigenia in Aulis"". Directing is excellent, and so is the cinematography. However, I thought the plot somewhat lacked (in quality and consistency), as did the relationship between Steven and his son (in depth). Kaurismaki-esque poker face performances are a trademark of Lanthimos', and the actors did a good job expressing the appropriate vibes. The music and sound effects were spot-on at times, but mostly over-used and tiring.Overall, the director presents a thrilling, supernatural twist on the classic euripidean tragedy, darkly comical and well-presented, that is a few flaws short of a great movie. An engaging and sensational watch, which has an unusual artistic delivery.For reference, some of my 7s: Man Bites Dog, The Butterfly Effect, Snowden"
224,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,8,7 November 2017,Lanthimos continues to deliver,"Colin Farrell is a cardiologist who has taken teenager Barry Keoghan under his wing. He meets him in secret, dispenses advice, gives him gifts and ultimately introduces him to his family ... Nicole Kidman, Raffey Cassidy and Sunny Suljic. It gradually becomes clear that Keoghan has some hold on Farrell, which is brought into stark relief when Farrell's family starts coming down with a mysterious illness. Farrell has to make an enormous sacrifice to avoid tragedy. The performances are universally amazing here, especially given the odd, extremely restrained style that Lanthimos is going for. This is a slow film that takes place in very bright, very still spaces. It's very reminiscent of Kubrick. Definitely not for all tastes, but if you've seen Lanthimos's earlier films, this is clearly the work of the same man."
225,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,9,6 November 2017,Arresting film that brings the cruelty,"Creeping, frightening and altogether clinical and cold, Yorgos Lanthimos' revenge thriller about a surgeon whose family is suddenly confronted by a peculiar but utterly vindictive teenager will slither into your consciousness in a serpentine and occasionally unsavory way. There are times when this film might feel like an endurance test, but it's worthwhile in the end, because it's such a beautifully acted and vividly directed work of cinema.Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman are excellent as the husband and wife physicians whose lush suburban lifestyle initially looks insular and beyond disturbance. But the real standout in this film is Barry Keoghan, who gives a malevolent performance as the nonchalant teenager whose father was a patient of Farrell's character. Initially, his presence seems merely peculiar and offbeat. But as the boy encroaches more on the family's life, the story takes on a more unsettling tone. Lanthimos' use of deadpan, nondescript dialogue masks something sinister and roiling underneath and the whole cast plays it exquisitely. And while this is not quite the black comedy that some have categorized it as, there are discreet moments of depraved humor.The film has a soundtrack that is classical and mournful but gradually becomes more violent and disquieting as it dots the storyline with dread and despair. As the sense of hopelessness starts to build up, the film ever so briefly becomes a touch static. This brief lapse is forgotten as the climax draws near. What I thought would end with shock and perhaps ambiguity, ends instead with a sense of relief and almost moral victory. It's as if after putting us through this labyrinth of horror and torment, Lanthimos gift-wraps it with a bow. It's a devilish touch. I first got acquainted with his filmmaking style with ""The Lobster"", a film that I reluctantly acknowledged as a good work. Here, he surpasses that achievement with something much closer to the bone and deathly scary. Recommended to the highest degree."
226,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,24 October 2017,Unsettling and interesting despite flaws.,"""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) is a tense psychological thriller directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. Dr. Stephen Murphy (Colin Farrell) finds himself in an unsettling situation when an old patient of his, Martin (Barry Keoghan), intrudes into his life and tinges his seemingly idyllic family: his wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) and children Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and Bob (Sunny Suljic). The story, written by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthimis Filippou, builds up tension with a slow pace at first. The dialog felt edgy, sometimes preposterous and sometimes comical (Especially one scene with Steven ranting in the kitchen) but it served to fill the air with anxiety and unease. It's directness and pace felt somewhat surreal. As information is cautiously revealed I felt captivated and uncomfortable (A long scene that occurred inside a car comes to mind). The characters take an active role in the story, with consequential decisions (Dr. Murphy's in particular) However the ultimate choice, which came with the last act, seems to lack consequence and it's aftermath felt weak. Moreover certain aspects of the plot seem to be left without explanation, undermining the story (Specially regarding Martin). Some characters also felt underdeveloped, regardless of their impact on the plot. Long intimate close-ups place you inside the characters minds and facilitate the ability to empathize. One shot, involving Anna and bob walking down the stairs was remarkable, as was the film's cinematography. Bleak, gray tones and an isolated atmosphere provoke a feeling of claustrophobia and lead you to think that there is no escape for our protagonist. The score and sound effects, involving long slowly built screeches, kept me uncomfortable and accentuated certain scenes involving two characters in particular: Steven and Martin. Barry Keoghan as Martin really made me feel like there was something not quite right with him at first, to fully suspecting a clinical mental disorder. Colin Farrell as Steven felt in command of his character as a confident successful man who is humiliated and brought low. Nicole Kidman as Anna felt like how any desperate parent would do believably reacts to the information that is unveiled to her. The tense dialog, brilliant cinematography, unsettling score and interesting acting carry this movie and kept me captivated despite it's seemingly slow pace and sometimes weak plot. This movie stands superior to most thrillers and is definitely worth a watch."
